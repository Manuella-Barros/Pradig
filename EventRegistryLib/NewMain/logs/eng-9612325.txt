Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, Ukrainian officials said, killing at least five people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities in the region, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period. But it drew a furious response from Moscow and warnings it could draw Russia into war with NATO.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nIn response, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Friday that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. Last week, Russia said military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons had begun.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nFive people were killed, according to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, while the governor said at least 25 were wounded.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\n___\n\nLee and Janicek reported from Prague.

This marks a significant policy shift amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. Although restricted to specific areas and weapon types, the decision reflects increased U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden quietly has authorized Kyiv to launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, three U.S. officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe decision marks a policy shift by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia. Russia's embassy in Washington and Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages. \"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" said one U.S. official.\n\nRussia is building up forces near the northern part of the region, but it lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push, Ukraine's top commander said\n\non Thursday. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine, bending\n\nto calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv. The U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nThe officials said that U.S. policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia. Nor does Biden's decision mean the U.S. now approves of drone attacks that Ukraine has been launching against Russian petroleum facilities, they said.\n\nSome NATO allies and U.S. lawmakers have been calling on Biden to relax the restriction on U.S. weapons to allow Ukraine to strike missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia that are backing Moscow's drive toward Kharkiv. Russia jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defenses have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defense lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and he raised anew a risk of nuclear war. Some experts dismissed his remarks as bluster. They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War II.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?\" Connolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the administration to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive. Countries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The decision marks a shift in U.S. policy, previously wary of escalatory responses from Moscow. This move follows increased pressure from Ukrainian officials and allies like Macron and Stoltenberg.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has given Ukraine the go-ahead to use American weaponry to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, according to three US officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, underscored that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nBiden's directive allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for ''counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them'', one official said.\n\nThe move comes as Ukrainian officials have stepped up calls on the US administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, according to three US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that US policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough US officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that,'' he said.\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\" The right to self-defence, he said, \"includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine\".\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event on Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\" Norway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defence of its territory\".\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend the D-Day commemorations.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

The two NATO member states have emphasised that their decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the northeastern Ukrainian Kharkiv region, where Moscow launched an offensive a few weeks ago.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden had been under pressure to authorise the decision, with Ukraine, the Baltic states, the Scandinavian countries, and Britain urging the United States to act. Biden had refused to do so, fearing that NATO could be dragged into a war with Russia, whose president, Vladimir Putin, warned the Western military alliance that they risked the outbreak of nuclear war.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia, which started with the Russian invasion more than two years ago, has reached a stalemate in the past year Recently, Moscow launched an offensive against the Kharkiv region, which borders Russia, and Russian troops have made significant territorial gains there. Russian fighter planes flying inside Russia have been supporting the offensive by firing bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, reports Reuters.\n\nJoe Biden \"recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" said one U.S. official.\n\nThe U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine, and it recently decided to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv. Washington will continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 300 kilometres, for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\nGermany has also given into pressure, with government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit announcingon Friday that Berlin has given Kyiv permission to use weapons supplied by Germany against military targets in Russia. \"We are jointly convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" he said.\n\nGerman policy on providing weapons has dramatically shifted, with Berlin initially only willing to send helmets to Ukraine at the beginning of Russia's invasion. Pressure by NATO allies, and from the hawkish Greens within the government, has persuaded Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz to allow the delivery of anti-aircraft systems and battle tanks. However, Scholz has refused to authorise the supply of long-range Taurus missiles, saying they could be used to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who is attending the ongoing NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Prague, downplayed the threat of an escalation of the war. \"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, and that includes also the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia,\" he said on Friday. He added that letting Western weapons hit targets in Russia was \"nothing new\" as Britain had long sent cruise missiles to Kyiv without restrictions.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also said on Tuesday that Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\n\"NATO countries that have approved strikes with their weapons on Russian territory should be aware that their equipment and specialists will be destroyed not only in Ukraine, but also at any point from where Russian territory is attacked,\" former Russian president, now deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev warned on Friday. He said all long-range weapons supplied to Ukraine were already \"directly operated by servicemen from NATO countries,\" which is tantamount to participation in the war against Russia.", "source":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 12 miles from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that,\" he said.\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \"includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Karel Janicek and Ellen Knickmeyer of The

They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War II.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?\"\n\nConnolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Rep. Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the administration to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive.\n\nCountries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"},

Strike Russia with American Weapons", "body": "In a major policy change, the Joe Biden administration has quietly allowed Ukraine to use provided American weapons to strike Russian territory near Kharkiv.\n\nThis decision aims to strengthen Ukraine's defense of its second-largest city against Russian advances, Politico reports.\n\nThe permission, confirmed by US officials, enables Ukraine to target Russian forces attacking or preparing to attack Kharkiv.\n\nHowever, the policy still prohibits long-range strikes deep inside Russia.\n\nA US official noted that President Joe Biden directed his team to support Ukraine's counter-fire efforts in response to Russia's recent intensified offensive on Kharkiv.\n\nREAD NEXT: Joe Biden Opens Door for Cuban Small Businesses to Access US Online Banking\n\nRecently, the US granted Ukraine the flexibility to use American weapons, such as rockets and launchers, to defend itself from border attacks near Kharkiv.\n\nThese weapons can intercept Russian missiles, target troop concentrations, and engage bombers launching attacks on Ukrainian territory.\n\nHowever, Ukraine is restricted from using these weapons against civilian infrastructure or conducting long-range strikes inside Russia, according to CNN.\n\nThe shift in US policy, initially seen as a potential escalation, was driven by worsening battlefield conditions and Russian advances in Kharkiv.\n\nThe National Security Council has not commented on the change.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken suggested US policy toward Ukraine would evolve, and National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby did not rule out a policy change.\n\nTop US allies like the UK and France support Ukraine's right to use Western weapons for strikes inside Russia.\n\nBipartisan Congressional support exists, with military officials briefing Congress on the strategic value of such strikes.\n\nSome US officials worry about Ukraine using drones for unrelated military targets.\n\nThe US stresses that American weapons should target military sites directly involved in the invasion, not civilian infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have pressed the Joe Biden administration to change its policy, arguing that not targeting Russian troop positions across the border complicates their defense.\n\nIn a conversation with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov advocated for using American weapons inside Russia to defend Kharkiv.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's decision is limited to areas near Kharkiv, and Ukraine has not requested broader permissions.\n\nThe US maintains its prohibition on using long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\nEuropean leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, support Ukraine's use of Western weapons for self-defense.\n\nMacron emphasized targeting bases in Russia from which attacks on Ukraine are launched, Reuters noted.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged the US and allies to provide Ukraine with the necessary capabilities to defend itself without limitations, including striking legitimate military targets in Russia.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration's decision reflects growing international pressure and changing battlefield conditions.\n\nWhile Ukraine can use American weapons near Kharkiv, it remains prohibited from using long-range weapons like ATACMS for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\nThis decision does not endorse Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian petroleum facilities but is a significant step in supporting Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression near Kharkiv.\n\nInternational support and strategic considerations will continue to shape future policies.", "source": {"uri": "latinpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latin Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this month and heard a direct appeal from Zelenskyy to use U.S. military assistance to strike positions in Russian from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he said. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defence, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Minister Jan Lipavsky at NATO-related event on Thursday Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defence of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, killing at least four people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe German announcement brought a furious response from Moscow, where Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added, without elaborating on what Berlin called confidential agreements with Kyiv.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

All the people were granted anonymity to discuss internal decisions that haven't been announced.\n\nIn the last few days, the U.S. made the decision to allow Ukraine \"flexibility\" to defend itself from attacks on the border near Kharkiv, the second U.S. official said.\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory. But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nPer Reuters:\n\nRussia's embassy in Washington and Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNATO allies have been calling on the U.S. to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons against missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia that are supporting a cross-border offensive that Moscow launched toward Kharkiv this month.\n\nRussia jetfighters flying inside Russia have been backing the drive by launching glide bombs at Kharkiv and Ukrainian defense lines.\n\nWord of Biden's decision broke shortly after the Pentagon said the U.S. policy against use of U.S. weapons inside Russia had remained unchanged.\n\n\"The security assistance that we provide Ukraine is to be used within Ukraine.

They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War II.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said US Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?\"\n\nConnolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the administration to allow Ukraine to use US weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive.\n\nCountries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"},

Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, killing at least four people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe German announcement brought a furious response from Moscow, where Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added, without elaborating on what Berlin called confidential agreements with Kyiv.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defence.\"\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defence minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometres (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometres (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They added that US policy on longer range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\nThe official said Ukraine requested this limited change in policy after Russia began its offensive on Kharkiv earlier this month. A second official said the US made the decision in the last few days to allow Ukraine to be more flexible in how it defends itself from attacks close to the border.\n\nUkraine will now be able to use US rockets and rocket launchers to take down Russian missiles moving toward Kharkiv, to attack troops gathering just over the border close to the city, as well as Russian bombers.\n\nBut Ukraine cannot use US weaponry to strike civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, the official said, according to Politico. It also cannot strike military targets far inside Russia's borders.\n\nThe administration previously said this kind of change would escalate the war by further involving the US, but Ukraine's dire situation on the battlefield prompted Biden to change course.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Biden may change his mind on the matter, saying that US policy would change as needed. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesperson, also did not rule out a policy change.\n\nThis comes after US allies, including the UK and France, said Ukraine should be allowed to strike inside Russia using weapons supplied by the West. Both Democrats and Republicans have also backed the move in public and behind the scenes.\n\nA number of officials have been concerned that Ukraine has struck military targets not used in the invasion when using its own drones and the US has emphasized that Ukraine may only use US weapons to strike military targets actively used in the invasion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have argued for a policy change since Russia started its attack on Kharkiv, saying that for weeks, Ukrainian defense of Kharkiv and the rest of the country has been stymied by their inability to strike Russian troop positions just over the border.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov pushed hard to be able to use US weapons in Russia when speaking to US Defense Secretary

And we don't encourage attacks, or enable attacks, inside of Russia,\" said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course on the previous prohibition on striking targets within Russia.\n\nBlinken said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed,\" as he spoke to reporters on a visit to Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nBlinken, who traveled Kyiv earlier this month to see the increasingly grave situation as Russia pushes forward towards Kharkiv, had been widely reported to be pressing Biden to ease the rules.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, which starts with a dinner on Thursday, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits because they hampered Kyiv's ability to defend itself.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralize\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc",

This policy shift allows Ukraine to counter Russian offensives more effectively. NATO allies and U.S. lawmakers had pressured Biden to relax restrictions as tensions in the region escalate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden quietly has authorized Kyiv to launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, four U.S. officials said on Thursday. The decision marks a policy shift by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.\n\nRussia's embassy in Washington and Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages.\n\n\"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" said one U.S. official. Russia is building up forces near the northern part of the region, but it lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push, Ukraine's top commander said on Thursday.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia. It is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine, bending to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.\n\n\"The Biden administration has come a long way from their hypersensitivity to and misunderstanding of the risk of escalation,\" said Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former director for European affairs at the White House National Security Council under the Trump administration. He applauded the shift in Biden's policy, which he said \"unties Ukraine's hands.\"\n\n\"Of course it's the right move,\" Vindman said. The U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nThe officials said that U.S. policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia. Biden's decision also does not mean the U.S. now approves of drone attacks that Ukraine has been launching against Russian petroleum facilities, they said.\n\nSome NATO allies and U.S. lawmakers have been calling on Biden to relax the restriction on U.S. weapons to allow Ukraine to strike missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia that are backing Moscow's drive toward Kharkiv. Russia jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defenses have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defense lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and he raised anew a risk of nuclear war. Some experts dismissed his remarks as bluster. They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War Two.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?\" Connolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive. Countries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this month and heard a direct appeal from Zelenskyy to use U.S. military assistance to strike positions in Russian from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he said. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Minister Jan Lipavsky at NATO-related event on Thursday Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.\n\n___\n\nLee reported from Prague.

Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, killing at least four people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe German announcement brought a furious response from Moscow, where Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added, without elaborating on what Berlin called confidential agreements with Kyiv.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\n___\n\nLee and Janicek contributed from Prague.

But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv, and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed.\n\nPolitico was first to report the news.\n\nKyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nThe administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or 300 kilometers, away.\n\nUkraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration's tact this week when he noted that the US could \"adapt and adjust\" its position.\n\nA hallmark of US support for Ukraine \"has been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too,\" Blinken said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia.\n\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \"So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we're seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\"\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" Macron continued.\n\nGermany's Scholz echoed Macron's comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law.\n\nThe initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration's concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes.\n\nBlinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia's border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make sure to put Ukraine in a \"position where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\"\n\n\"The US is feeling the weight of the argument,\" said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming.\n\nIn fact, the wheels were already in motion for Biden to amend the US policy when Blinken returned to Washington two weeks ago. According to US officials, the secretary of state signed on to a recommendation that had been made to Biden by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff C.Q. Brown in the days after Russia launched its offensive on May 10.\n\nOn a May 13 secure video conference, the trio had heard appeals from their Ukrainian counterparts and determined that it made sense to lift the US restrictions so Ukrainian forces could hit the staging areas from which Russia was launching its attacks on Kharkiv. The head of US European Command, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, was brought into the conversation to help finalize the details.\n\nBut it would take until Thursday for the US decision to work its way through the system and go into effect.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia, sources said.\n\nStoltenberg's repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit - and perhaps necessity - of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits.\n\n\"To deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\" Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nRelated Story: Ukraine Faces Its Worst Crisis Since the War Began: BBC's Jeremy Bowen\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nRelated Story: Allies Debate Using Frozen Russian Assets as Ukraine Loses Ground\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this month and heard a direct appeal from Zelenskyy to use U.S. military assistance to strike positions in Russian from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\nRelated Story: Russian Missiles Kill 7 in Ukraine's Second-Largest City as ...\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he said. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The change was first reported by online media outlet Politico.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Kyiv's allies to allow it to use their longer-range weaponry to hit targets on Russian soil amid a surge in attacks this month, particularly on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, some 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the border with Russia.\n\nA Russian attack at midnight (21:00 GMT) killed at least three people and injured 16 after a Russian missile hit an apartment block in the city. Last weekend, 19 were killed after a Russian attack on a hardware superstore.\n\n\"The Biden administration has come a long way from their hypersensitivity to and misunderstanding of the risk of escalation,\" Alexander Vindman, a retired army lieutenant colonel and former director for European affairs at the White House National Security Council under the Trump administration, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nHe applauded the shift in Biden's policy, which he said \"unties Ukraine's hands\".\n\n\"Of course, it's the right move,\" Vindman said.\n\nThe US is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle to push back the Russian military, which began a full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.\n\nThe Biden decision came hours after NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg told the alliance's foreign ministers that the \"time had come\" to relax the restrictions placed on Kyiv over the use of the weapons and \"enable Ukrainians to really defend themselves\".\n\n\"We need to remember what it is,\" he said. \"This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defence, Stoltenberg added, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine\".\n\nThe officials said Washington would continue to prohibit Ukraine from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 300km (186 miles), and other long-range US weapons for attacks deep inside Russia.\n\nMoscow has been using missile launchers and other military sites just inside its border with Ukraine to support its offensive in the Kharkiv region, while fighter aircraft have been used to unleash glide bombs on Kharkiv itself, which was home to about 1.5 million people before the war.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukraine's top military commander Oleksandr Syrskii said Russia was moving additional regiments and brigades to the north of the Kharkiv region, just across the border.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType":

They maintained, however, that restrictions on using US weapons to strike targets deep inside of Russia remain in place.\n\nThe revised limitations come after Russia renewed offensive efforts to seize Kharkiv earlier this month, and an official said Ukraine asked for them in the wake of Russia's effort.\n\nUkraine is now able to use US weapons to carry out a number of attacks against Russia, including hitting rockets and rocket launchers near Kharkiv, downing missiles bound for the city, striking Russian troops amassing along the border, and shooting at bombers launching missiles at targets inside of Ukraine.\n\nStrikes on civilian infrastructure are still forbidden, as are the use of long-range missiles to strike deep inside of Russia, according to Politico.\n\nThe National Security Council, the division of the White House that normally fields questions on matters of national security, did not immediately return a request for comment on the report. But Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said \"there's been no change in our policy,\" emphasizing that US security aid is to be used within Ukraine.\n\n\"We don't encourage attacks or enable attacks inside of Russia. We believe that Ukraine can be effective by focusing on tactical and operational targets that directly influence the conflict within its boundaries, rather than going after larger geopolitical targets within Russia. So our policy hasn't changed,\" she said. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Andrii Marienko)KYIV, Ukraine (AP) - Germany joined the United States on Friday in authorizing Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying - a significant policy change that comes as depleted Ukrainian troops are losing ground in the war. Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration over restrictions on the use of Western weapons - especially as the border region of Kharkiv has endured a Russian onslaught this month that has stretched Kyiv's outgunned and outmanned forces. Both Germany and the U.S. specifically authorized defense of Kharkiv, whose capital city of the same name lies only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia. Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, killing at least four people. Beyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period. The German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. The German announcement brought a furious response from Moscow, where Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\"\u009d - an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out. Western leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. But as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners. The Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine. The German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia. \"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\"\u009d the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\"\u009d it added, without elaborating on what Berlin called confidential agreements with Kyiv. Biden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\"\u009d one official told The Associated Press. But the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed. The question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law - Ukraine's right to self-defense.\" Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory. In Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\"\u009d he said. Russia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\"\u009d including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said. Overall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added. It was not possible to verify his battlefield claims. Overnight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said. Ukrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles - the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war. Apart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials. ___ Lee and Janicek contributed from Prague.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory.

But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv, and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed.\n\nPolitico was first to report the news.\n\nKyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nThe administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or 300 kilometers, away.\n\nUkraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration's tact this week when he noted that the US could \"adapt and adjust\" its position.\n\nA hallmark of US support for Ukraine \"has been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too,\" Blinken said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia.\n\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \"So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we're seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\"\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" Macron continued.\n\nGermany's Scholz echoed Macron's comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law.\n\nThe initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration's concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes.\n\nBlinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia's border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make sure to put Ukraine in a \"position where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\"\n\n\"The US is feeling the weight of the argument,\" said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming.\n\nIn fact, the wheels were already in motion for Biden to amend the US policy when Blinken returned to Washington two weeks ago. According to US officials, the secretary of state signed on to a recommendation that had been made to Biden by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff C.Q. Brown in the days after Russia launched its offensive on May 10.\n\nOn a May 13 secure video conference, the trio had heard appeals from their Ukrainian counterparts and determined that it made sense to lift the US restrictions so Ukrainian forces could hit the staging areas from which Russia was launching its attacks on Kharkiv. The head of US European Command, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, was brought into the conversation to help finalize the details.\n\nBut it would take until Thursday for the US decision to work its way through the system and go into effect.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia, sources said.\n\nStoltenberg's repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit - and perhaps necessity - of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits.\n\n\"To deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\" Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War II.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said US Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?\"\n\nConnolly co-signed a 20 May letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to use US weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive.\n\nCountries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [],

But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv, and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed.\n\nPolitico was first to report the news.\n\nKyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nThe administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or 300 kilometers, away.\n\nUkraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration's tact this week when he noted that the US could \"adapt and adjust\" its position.\n\nA hallmark of US support for Ukraine \"has been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too,\" Blinken said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia.\n\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \"So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we're seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\"\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" Macron continued.\n\nGermany's Scholz echoed Macron's comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law.\n\nThe initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration's concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes.\n\nBlinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia's border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make sure to put Ukraine in a \"position where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\"\n\n\"The US is feeling the weight of the argument,\" said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia, sources said.\n\nStoltenberg's repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit - and perhaps necessity - of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits.\n\n\"To deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\" Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people in a night-time attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the country's second-largest city.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nA Russian onslaught this month in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including a Russian aerial bomb attack on a large construction supplies store that killed 18 people on May 25, has forced the evacuation of thousands of people and has stretched Ukraine's depleted forces in what is proving to be a critical period in the war, which is now in its third year.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials,\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThat restriction has frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military is unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 km (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

All the people were granted anonymity to discuss internal decisions that haven't been announced.\n\nThe second U.S. official said the U.S. decided in the last few days to allow Ukraine \"flexibility\" to defend itself from attacks on the border near Kharkiv.\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory.\n\nBut the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIt's a stunning shift the administration initially said would escalate the war by more directly involving the U.S. in the fight. But worsening conditions for Ukraine on the battlefield -- namely Russia's advances and improved position in Kharkiv -- led the president to change his mind.\n\nThe National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Biden administration hinted that a decision had either been secretly made or forthcoming in recent days. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who supports a restriction lift, became the first U.S. official to publicly hint that Biden may shift course and allow such strikes, telling reporters that U.S. policy toward Ukraine would evolve as needed.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico. Reuters, the Washington Post and other U.S. media outlets also cited Biden administration officials to confirm the move.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this month and heard a direct appeal from Zelenskyy to use U.S. military assistance to strike positions in Russian from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he said. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Minister Jan Lipavsky at NATO-related event on Thursday Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [],

That appears to have prompted the change in policy among Western leaders.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people in a nighttime attack.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fox61.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

lets Ukraine use US arms inside Russia - World News", "body": "Russian strikes killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the regional governor said early Friday, hours after the United States authorised Kiev to use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia in defense of the embattled region.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range U.S. weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said in an interview with local media there could be more people trapped under the rubble of the residential building, adding: \"There was not a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nTerekhov later put the number of wounded at 23.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nRestrictions lifted\n\nU.S. officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second U.S. official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defense ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defense (and) drones\".\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\n\"They are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this month and heard a direct appeal from Zelenskyy to use U.S. military assistance to strike positions in Russian from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he said. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Minister Jan Lipavsky at NATO-related event on Thursday Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.\n\nLee reported from Prague.

Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden's decision allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\", one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials stressed that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them.\n\nThe tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 12 miles from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on February 24 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of 600-mile front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops.\n\n\"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\"\n\nUkrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has stressed that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nMoscow seized on Nato Secretary General Mr Stoltenberg's comments on British arms supplied to Ukraine.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed his remarks showed they have been used against targets on Russian soil all

killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the regional governor said early Friday, hours after the United States authorised Kyiv to use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia in defence of the embattled region.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said in an interview with local media there could be more people trapped under the rubble of the residential building, adding: \"There was not a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nTerekhov later put the number of wounded at 23.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\n- Restrictions lifted -\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defence ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defence (and) drones\".\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\n\"They are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType":

A fresh attack killed three more in the Ukrainian city overnight - Copyright AFP SERGEY BOBOK\n\nRussian strikes killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the regional governor said early Friday, hours after the United States authorised Kyiv to use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia in defence of the embattled region.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said in an interview with local media there could be more people trapped under the rubble of the residential building, adding: \"There was not a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nTerekhov later put the number of wounded at 23.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\n- Restrictions lifted -\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defence ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defence (and) drones\".\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\n\"They are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com",

Previously, Biden's policy, to the extent that he's capable of articulating such a thing, was that American weapons could only be used in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia. Incongruously, this included Occupied Crimea, which Putin annexed a decade ago, and four other Ukrainian oblasts annexed in 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration has quietly given Ukraine permission to strike inside Russia -- solely near the area of Kharkiv -- using U.S.-provided weapons, three U.S. officials and two other people familiar with the move said Thursday, a major reversal that will help Ukraine to better defend its second-largest city.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" one of the U.S. officials said, adding that the policy of not allowing long-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\nThe new rules of engagement are that US weapons can target Russian troops, missile launchers, and artillery in Belgorod Oblast to blunt the Russian invasion force aimed at Kharkiv. Russian aircraft in flight are also fair game, but shades of LBJ and Vietnam, Russian aircraft lined up wingtip-to-wingtip on the runway preparing to bomb Ukraine are off limits.\n\nThis change reflects the culmination of a lengthy debate inside White House policy circles. And by debate, I mean an absolute route as the political sands under Biden drifted away.\n\nBACKGROUND: Biden White House Establishes Sanctuaries for Russian Forces Attacking Ukraine; Does This Sound Familiar?\n\nIt was decided more by the risk of being left alone holding an indefensible position than by any geostrategic calculus.\n\nThe previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia.\n\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \"So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we're seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\"\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" Macron continued.\n\nGermany's Scholz echoed Macron's comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law.\n\nThe initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration's concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes.\n\nBlinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia's border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make sure to put Ukraine in a \"position where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\"\n\n\"The US is feeling the weight of the argument,\" said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how fast this train is moving, the day before Scholz said Ukraine should be able to use German weapons against targets in Russia, Scholtz stood beside Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and said the opposite.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the internal debate on Wednesday.\n\nNow, after months of complaints about the restrictions from Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, the White House has begun a formal -- and apparently rapid -- reassessment of whether to take the risk. Approving further uses of U.S. weapons would give Kyiv a way to conduct counterattacks on artillery and missile sites that now enjoy something of a safe haven just inside Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, in Moldova, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken became the first administration official to publicly leave open the possibility that the Biden administration might \"adapt and adjust\" its stance about attacking inside Russia with American weapons, based on changing battlefield conditions.\n\n\"We're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself,\" Mr. Blinken said.\n\nAs I pointed out in my last Ukraine Update, Jake Sullivan was under attack from all corners over the policy. Even NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was open in his opposition to what passed for a Biden policy. By my count, at least a dozen nations have given Ukraine the green light to use their weapons against targets in Russia.\n\nBACKGROUND: Putin's War, Week 117. Jake Sullivan Under Fire, ATACMS Everywhere, and the Stalemate Continues\n\nThe new policy does this to the north Ukraine battlespace.\n\nThe map includes markings for four Russian aircraft that were shot down in a Patriot ambush in May 2023. When Ukraine did this, the White House threatened to cancel arms sales to Ukraine if the episode was repeated.\n\nBACKGROUND: Four Russian Aircraft Were Shot Down Over Russia in a Couple of Minutes and No One Is Giving Straight Answers.\n\nIf Ukraine is permitted to use all Western systems against any target in Russia, this is what the new battlespace looks like.\n\nIf this war is to be brought to a just conclusion, Russia must be forced to evacuate Occupied Ukraine (Crimea is on the bubble). To do that, Russian military assets in Russia must be attacked. Allowing Russia to fire artillery and launch missiles and bombers from within a sanctuary zone is one of the more stupid ideas Jake Sullivan has ever come up with.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblasts_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblasts of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

targets within Russia.\n\nThe issue is a controversial one, with fears from Western leaders that if their weaponry is used to strike inside Russia, it would escalate the violence and trigger a wider war involving NATO.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repetitively asked permission from his allies to expand the usage of the provided weapons to strike inside Russia.", "source": {"uri":

Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden's decision allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\", one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials stressed that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nOne of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them.\n\nThe tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 12 miles from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on February 24 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of 600-mile front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.", "source": {"uri": "edp24.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eastern Daily Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now that is going to happen.\n\nIn a major policy shift, the Biden administration \"recently\" approved Ukraine's use of U.S.-supplied weapons on Russian territory, but only near Kharkiv, two U.S. officials confirmed to The War Zone. Ukraine has long been barred by the U.S. from using weapons it has donated against targets in Russia proper.\n\n\"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official told The War Zone. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of [Army Tactical Missile System] ATACMS or long range strikes inside of Russia has not changed.\"\n\nPolitico was the first to report that news.\n\nRussia is staging its forces across the border and firing from there, this includes launching airstrikes using glide bombs from Russian territory. This would presumably allow Ukraine to now fire on all these target types, taking away this safe haven for Russian forces.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Pentagon said there was \"no change\" in the policy prohibiting Ukraine from using donated weapons like M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS and ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles inside Russia. Ukraine has been using both weapons to devastating effect inside its own borders.\n\n\"The security assistance that we provide Ukraine is to be used within Ukraine, and we don't encourage attacks or enable attacks inside of Russia,\" Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokesperson, told reporters, including from The War Zone Thursday afternoon. \"We believe Ukraine can be effective by focusing on tactical and operational targets that directly influence the conflict within its boundaries rather than going after larger, geopolitical targets within Russia.\"\n\n\"We believe that we've given them the capabilities and the systems to be effective on the battlefield right now,\" she added.\n\nWhen asked about what changed since the press conference, the Pentagon deferred questions to the White House National Security Council.\n\nThe policy shift comes as several U.S. allies have announced they will allow their long-range strike weapons provided to Ukraine to be used inside Russian territory.\n\nAs we previously reported, the U.K. weeks ago said they have no qualms about Ukraine using its donated Storm Shadow cruise missiles.\n\n\"Sweden, Finland, the Baltic countries, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, Canada and others have said they have no problem with Ukraine's using their weapons to hit Russia,\" as well, Politico reported.\n\nFrance, which gave Ukraine SCALP EG cruise missiles, and Germany also agreed but issued caveats.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Ukraine could \"neutralize\" targets in Russia \"from which the missiles are fired, but not other civilian or military targets.\"\n\nUkraine can use the weapons provided \"within the framework of international law,\" said German Chancellor Olaf, according to the publication.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen \"has announced that Ukraine will be allowed to use Danish-supplied F-16 fighter jets to strike military targets inside Russia,\" Ukrainian Pravda reported.\n\nPolish Secretary of State at the Ministry of National Defense Cezary Tomczyk told Polish news outlet Radio ZET that Ukraine \"can fight however they want\" with the MiG-29 fighters and other weapons it provided.\n\n\"We decided to help Ukraine in the conflict, Ukraine was brutally attacked, so it has the right to defend itself as it sees fit,\" said Tomczyk,\" according to the Kyiv Post. Tomczyk called on other allies to lift the restrictions placed on Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, warning that there would be \"serious consequences\" if western weapons were used inside Russia, hinted that he could use nuclear strikes against small European nations if NATO allowed Ukraine to attack what he called \"deep in Russian territory,\" The Washington Post reported. He warned that NATO officials \"should be fully aware of what is at stake.\"\n\n\"If Europe were to face those serious consequences, what will the United States do, considering our strategic arms parity? It is hard to tell,\" he said, referring to U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. \"Are they looking for a global conflict?\"\n\nClearly all eyes will be on Moscow's reaction to this change in policy and how effective these strikes end up being, but one thing is for certain, this is a major shift that Ukraine has long asked for finally getting the official ok.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

According to more details of what are expected to be the immediate implications:\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory. But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIt's a stunning shift the administration initially said would escalate the war by more directly involving the U.S. in the fight. But worsening conditions for Ukraine on the battlefield -- namely Russia's advances and improved position in Kharkiv -- led the president to change his mind.\n\nUkraine has been complaining that all restrictions need to be taken off if it is to defend against Russia's recent major offensive in Kharkiv, which was launched from across the border. For example, Russian artillery is able to fire from rear positions within the Belgorod region near the border. It meanwhile remains part of Moscow's stated aim to push the border deeper into Ukraine to create a 'buffer zone' - making it harder for pro-Kiev forces to shell Russian towns and villages.\n\nPolitico's fresh reporting is consistent with something Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. While visiting Moldova - itself feeling the pressure of the war right next door - Blinken laid out that the US does not \"encourage or enable\" Ukrainian attacks inside Russia - but he then moved the goalpost by stressing the US would \"adapt and adjust\" this position based on developing battlefield needs.\n\nA reporter followed up by asking if he meant the White House will now support Ukrainian attacks inside Russia. Blinken responded with: \"Adapt and adjust means exactly that.\"\n\nOn a covert level this was likely already happening all along...\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this week there will be \"major consequences\" if NATO countries support long-range strikes on Russian territory. While it's long been clear that US, UK, French, and other West-supplied weaponry has been used against Crimea, this has yet to be the case when it comes to Russia proper. Or at least any such attack has not been made public yet.\n\nThis significant shift underscores the desperation of Western allies as Ukrainian forces have been getting rolled back in the Kharkiv region. It seems Washington, London, Paris, and Brussels simply cannot stomach a Ukrainian loss - but this desperation is leading to deepened and highly dangerous Western deepening involvement in the conflict.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

allows Ukraine limited use of US arms to strike inside Russia, say US officials - West Hawaii Today", "body": "WASHINGTON/PRAGUE -- President Joe Biden quietly has authorized Kyiv to launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, four U.S. officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe decision marks a policy shift by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.\n\nRussia's embassy in Washington and Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages.\n\n\"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" said one U.S. official.\n\nRussia is building up forces near the northern part of the region, but it lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push, Ukraine's top commander said on Thursday.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine, bending to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.\n\n\"The Biden administration has come a long way from their hypersensitivity to and misunderstanding of the risk of escalation,\" said Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former director for European affairs at the White House National Security Council under the Trump administration.\n\nHe applauded the shift in Biden's policy, which he said \"unties Ukraine's hands.\"\n\n\"Of course it's the right move,\" Vindman said.\n\nThe U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nThe officials said that U.S. policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\nBiden's decision also does not mean the U.S. now approves of drone attacks that Ukraine has been launching against Russian petroleum facilities, they said.\n\nSome NATO allies and U.S. lawmakers have been calling on Biden to relax the restriction on U.S. weapons to allow Ukraine to strike missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia that are backing Moscow's drive toward Kharkiv.\n\nRussia jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defenses have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defense lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and he raised anew a risk of nuclear war.\n\nSome experts dismissed his remarks as bluster.\n\nThey noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War Two.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news",

But Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said \"there's been no change in our policy,\" emphasizing that US security aid is to be used within Ukraine.\n\n\"We don't encourage attacks or enable attacks inside of Russia. We believe that Ukraine can be effective by focusing on tactical and operational targets that directly influence the conflict within its boundaries, rather than going after larger geopolitical targets within Russia. So our policy hasn't changed,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/05/30/thumbs_b_c_228e5db1db7c5705121e66bf68e4d98d.jpg?v=235412", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-05-", "textStart": 245, "textEnd": 251}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nTalks about changing the policy intensified inside the Biden administration more than two weeks ago, after Russia stepped up its offensive around Kharkiv, according to one of the officials familiar with the White House deliberations.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a secure video conference with their Ukrainian counterparts in which the Ukrainian side pressed for permission to use U.S. weaponry to hit Russian positions across the border that were being used to attack the Kharkiv region, according to a U.S. official familiar with the White House deliberation.\n\nFollowing that May 13 meeting with the Ukrainians, Sullivan, Austin and Brown huddled and agree to make a recommendation to Biden to alter the policy.\n\nSullivan presented the recommendation to Biden two days later, making the case that it was common-sense for the Ukrainians to be able to strike back to counter the attacks on their land that were originating from Russian territory. Biden agreed.\n\nLater on May 15, Biden had a follow-up conversation with Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who leads U.S. European command, Austin and Sullivan and asked them to move forward on finalizing the details to the change in policy.\n\nMeanwhile, during Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the top U.S. diplomat's thinking.\n\nBlinken met with Biden and Sullivan on May 17, following his visit to Kyiv, and shared what he heard from Zelenskyy and made clear that he also supported giving the Ukrainians more leeway to strike back on Russia.\n\nStill, Biden remained cautious and asked for due diligence before giving final approval.\n\nSullivan convened the administration's national security leaders for a conversation the following week, and they all agreed to move forward. Sullivan received final approval from Biden several days ago, but the guidance did not go into effect until Thursday, the official said.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision to make. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that,\" he said.\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend the D-Day commemorations.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_G._Cavoli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher G.

They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War II.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?\"\n\nConnolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the administration to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive.\n\nCountries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland, Humeyra Pamuk and Phil Stewart; additional reporting by Michelle Nichols in New York; writing by Jonathan Landay; editing by Jonathan Oatis and David Gregorio)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The German government said Friday that Ukraine can use German-supplied weapons against Russian attacks from positions just over their joint border, in a significant policy change that came a day after US President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the country's second-largest city.\n\nA German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added, without elaborating on what Berlin called confidential agreements with Kyiv.\n\nA Russian onslaught this month in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including a Russian aerial bomb attack on a large construction supplies store that killed 18 people on May 25, has forced the evacuation of thousands of people and has stretched Ukraine's depleted forces in what is proving to be a critical period in the war, which is now in its third year. That appears to have prompted the change in policy among Western leaders.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in US military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people in a nighttime attack.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.

"Deadly strikes on Kharkiv as Biden lets Ukraine use US arms inside Russia", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine: Russian strikes killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the regional governor said early Friday, hours after the United States authorised Kyiv to use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia in defence of the embattled region.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox\n\nSign up for The Manila Times newsletters\n\nBy signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said in an interview with local media there could be more people trapped under the rubble of the residential building, adding: \"There was not a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nTerekhov later put the number of wounded at 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nRestrictions lifted\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defence ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defence (and) drones\".\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing.", "source": {"uri":

We're defending Ukraine and it is not the same,\" he said.\n\n'Stop the madness'\n\nA U.S. official said on Thursday that President Joe Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons or counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\".\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second U.S. official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top U.S. military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe change in Washington's thinking was attributed by U.S. officials to Russia's daily pounding of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nIn the latest Russian strikes on the city overnight, five people were killed and 23 wounded, including two children, officials said, warning residents could still be trapped under the rubble.\n\n\"The rescue and search operation continues. All services are working at the scene,\" said regional governor Oleg Synegubov.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pressed Western allies for more air defense fire power.\n\n\"Our top priorities are to ensure more air defense systems for Ukraine, joint defense industry projects, and weapons for our warriors, as well as global efforts to force Russia to make peace,\" he said on social media during a visit to Sweden on Friday.\n\n\"Only together we can stop the madness from Moscow,\" he told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n'The advance is underway'\n\nUkraine has intensified strikes on Russian targets in recent months, claiming drone attacks on military and energy infrastructure targets deep inside the country.\n\nRussia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\nThe increasing intensity of strikes has come as Russian troops have made gradual advances in Ukraine this year after holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive last year.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said Moscow's forces had seized 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory so far in 2024.\n\n\"The advance is underway in all tactical directions,\" he said at a meeting of the Russian-led CSTO security alliance in Almaty, according to Russian news agencies.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nTalks about changing the policy intensified inside the Biden administration more than two weeks ago, after Russia stepped up its offensive around Kharkiv, according to one of the officials familiar with the White House deliberations.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a secure video conference with their Ukrainian counterparts in which the Ukrainian side pressed for permission to use U.S. weaponry to hit Russian positions across the border that were being used to attack the Kharkiv region, according to a U.S. official familiar with the White House deliberation.\n\nFollowing that May 13 meeting with the Ukrainians, Sullivan, Austin and Brown huddled and agree to make a recommendation to Biden to alter the policy.\n\nSullivan presented the recommendation to Biden two days later, making the case that it was common-sense for the Ukrainians to be able to strike back to counter the attacks on their land that were originating from Russian territory. Biden agreed.\n\nLater on May 15, Biden had a follow-up conversation with Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who leads U.S. European command, Austin and Sullivan and asked them to move forward on finalizing the details to the change in policy.\n\nMeanwhile, during Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the top U.S. diplomat's thinking.\n\nBlinken met with Biden and Sullivan on May 17, following his visit to Kyiv, and shared what he heard from Zelenskyy and made clear that he also supported giving the Ukrainians more leeway to strike back on Russia.\n\nStill, Biden remained cautious and asked for due diligence before giving final approval.\n\nSullivan convened the administration's national security leaders for a conversation the following week, and they all agreed to move forward. Sullivan received final approval from Biden several days ago, but the guidance did not go into effect until Thursday, the official said.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision to make. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that,\" he said.\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory.

"title": "Deadly strikes on Kharkiv as Biden lets Ukraine use US arms inside Russia", "body": "Two Ukrainian servicemen sit facing the 'Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine', a memorial for Ukrainian soldiers, in the center of Kyiv\n\nRussian strikes killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the regional governor said early Friday, hours after the United States authorised Kyiv to use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia in defence of the embattled region.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said in an interview with local media there could be more people trapped under the rubble of the residential building, adding: \"There was not a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nTerekhov later put the number of wounded at 23.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\n- Restrictions lifted -\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\nMore from this section Djokovic shrugs off troubles in winning start at French Open Hundreds attend national conference in St. John's to see latest tech for the bottom of bodies of water Kate branded the Royal Family's 'greatest asset' as future Queen 'seen out and about'\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defence ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defence (and) drones\".\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\n\"They are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing.\n\nbur-juf/smw/cwl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors":

We're defending Ukraine and it is not the same,\" he said.\n\n- 'Stop the madness' -\n\nA US official said on Thursday that President Joe Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons or counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\".\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe change in Washington's thinking was attributed by US officials to Russia's daily pounding of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nIn the latest Russian strikes on the city overnight, five people were killed and 23 wounded, including two children, officials said, warning residents could still be trapped under the rubble.\n\n\"The rescue and search operation continues. All services are working at the scene,\" said regional governor Oleg Synegubov.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\"

industry projects, and weapons for our warriors, as well as global efforts to force Russia to make peace,\" he said on social media during a visit to Sweden on Friday.\n\n\"Only together we can stop the madness from Moscow,\" he told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n- 'The advance is underway' -\n\nUkraine has intensified strikes on Russian targets in recent months, claiming drone attacks on military and energy infrastructure targets deep inside the country.\n\nRussia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\nThe increasing intensity of strikes has come as Russian troops have made gradual advances in Ukraine this year after holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive last year.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said Moscow's forces had seized 880 square kilometres (340 square miles) of territory so far in 2024.\n\n\"The advance is underway in all tactical directions,\" he said at a meeting of the Russian-led CSTO security alliance

President Joe Biden secretly lifted restrictions on Ukraine using American-supplied weapons against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the under-fire Kharkiv region, US officials said Thursday.\n\nBiden had come under increasing pressure from a desperate Ukraine to ease his ban, but had so far resisted amid fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict or even a nuclear standoff with Moscow.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said.\n\n\"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the official said on condition of anonymity, referring to long-range missiles recently sent by Washington to Kyiv.\n\nA second US official confirmed Biden's change of policy, which comes as Russian forces push forward with an offensive against the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Kyiv's supporters - chiefly the United States - to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets on Russian soil.\n\nThe United States has been rushing to get arms to Ukraine after Congress passed a huge military aid package following a six-month delay in April, but Biden had been reluctant to allow cross-border strikes.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden was changing course in response, saying that Washington had \"adapted and adjusted.\"\n\nBiden's shift followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials in the days after Russia launched its Kharkiv offensive on May 10.\n\nUkraine asked for permission to use US arms on Russian territory on May 13, and Biden agreed in principle on May 15 after National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made the case for Ukraine to be able to defend itself.\n\nBiden then met on May 17 with Blinken, who travelled to Kyiv earlier this month to see the increasingly grave situation as Russia pushes towards Kharkiv, and had been widely reported to be pressing Biden to ease the rules.\n\nAfter working through the details, the US president gave a final sign-off in recent days but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe White House has however made it clear to Kyiv that the permission for cross-border attacks was limited to targets just over the border, which were being used by Russia to launch offensives.\n\nOfficials also insisted that they had been expecting some form of Russian offensive and that with the influx of US arms, it has been stalled, preventing the possible capture of Kharkiv city.\n\nPressure had been mounting for Biden and other Western countries to end their ban on Ukraine using their weapons to strike Russian soil.\n\nAhead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralize\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nSome countries including Britain and the Netherlands had already said Kyiv has the right to use their weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\n\nBiden's change also comes shortly before he heads to Europe for a series of meetings where Kyiv's plight will be in focus.\n\nBiden will attend ceremonies in France marking the World War II D-Day landings in early June where Ukraine's Zelensky will also be present.\n\nThe US president will also meet leaders of the world's top economies at the G7 summit in Italy.\n\nBut Zelensky has criticized Biden for apparently planning to skip a Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland just after the G7, which clashes with an election fundraiser for the US president hosted by Hollywood stars George Clooney and Julia Roberts.", "source": {"uri":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this month and heard a direct appeal from Zelenskyy to use U.S. military assistance to strike positions in Russian from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he said. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.\n\n__\n\nBy MATTHEW LEE, AAMER MADHANI and ZEKE MILLER Associated Press\n\nLee reported from Prague.

As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" he added.\n\nThis position was shared after several top U.S. allies, including Germany and France, began calling for Ukraine to have the right to wage attacks inside Russia itself using Western weapons.\n\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said during a visit this Tuesday to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany, according to CNN.\n\n\"So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we're seeing around Kharkiv at the moment if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\" he added.\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" he continued.\n\nTo his credit, Macron did stress that the West \"must not allow them [the Ukrainians] to hit other targets in Russia,\" including civilian homes and infrastructure.\n\n(Video Credit: Fox News)\n\nDuring the same presser, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz echoed Macron's sentiment and stressed that Ukraine is allowed to protect itself so long as it stays within the rules established by the West.\n\n\"Ukraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing,\" he said. \"That has to be said explicitly. I find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.\"\n\nWhy is any of this a concern? Because Western nations are fearful that if donated weapons are used inside Russia, it could trigger massive escalation and even another world war.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has nevertheless repeatedly tried to pressure his Western allies into loosening the rules for him.\n\n\"In a discussion with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov made a 'hard push' to use U.S. weapons in Russia,\" Politico notes.\n\nIt's known for a fact that Ukraine has used its own drones to target Russian infrastructure not directly related to the war.\n\nIn the wake of the latest news, critics are now crying foul, accusing the Biden administration of pushing America toward another World War:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Sanger and Edward Wong NYT News Service/Syndicate Stories\n\nPRAGUE -- President Joe Biden, under pressure from his top national security aides and European allies, has authorized Ukraine to conduct limited strikes inside Russia with U.S.-made weapons, opening what could well be a new chapter in the war for Ukraine, U.S. officials said Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision appears to mark the first time that an American president has authorized limited military attacks on artillery, missile bases and command centers inside the borders of a nuclear-armed adversary. White House officials insisted, however, that the authorization extended only to what they characterized as acts of self-defense, so that Ukraine could protect Kharkiv, its second-largest city, and the surrounding areas in the northeast from relentless fire from missiles, glide bombs and artillery shells from just over the border.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official said in a statement issued by the administration. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the statement continued, referring to an artillery system, provided to Ukraine, that has the capability to reach deep inside Russian territory.\n\nInside the White House, Biden's deliberations were closely held, known only to a very narrow group of aides. But The New York Times revealed last week that Secretary of State Antony Blinken had come back from a sobering trip to Kyiv and privately told the president that his 27-month-long ban against shooting American weapons into Russian territory was now placing parts of Ukraine in peril. The Russians, he said, were exploiting the president's ban and mounting constant attacks from a safe haven just inside the Russian border.\n\nBy that time, Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, had also begun changing his view, senior officials said. So had U.S. allies: Britain weeks ago allowed Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow long-range missile systems for attacks anywhere in Russia, and France and Germany recently took the same position. So did Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO.\n\nThe decision follows weeks of discussion with the Ukrainians after Russia began a major assault on Kharkiv.\n\nBecause Kharkiv is so close to Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine repeatedly pressed Biden and his aides for the right to strike back inside Russia. Biden deflected those requests for months, concerned that using American weapons could escalate the conflict -- and put the United States into a direct confrontation with Russia.\n\nWhen he relented, it was in the most narrowly prescribed way. The permission from Biden is intended solely for Ukraine to strike military sites in Russia being used to attack the Kharkiv area, U.S. officials said. Attacks from Russia in other regions -- even near Kyiv, the capital -- cannot be answered with the use of American weapons.\n\nA senior U.S. official in Washington said the administration's policy prohibiting Ukraine from using U.S.-made weapons for \"long-range\" attacks inside Russia had not changed.\n\nThe decision by Biden was reported earlier Thursday by Politico.\n\nThe Pentagon is charged with giving Ukraine the exact guidelines of what it can strike in Russia, U.S. officials said. Those have already been conveyed by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III to Gen. Christopher G.

We're defending Ukraine and it is not the same,\" he said.\n\n- 'Stop the madness' -\n\nA US official said on Thursday that President Joe Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons or counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\".\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe change in Washington's thinking was attributed by US officials to Russia's daily pounding of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nIn the latest Russian strikes on the city overnight, five people were killed and 23 wounded, including two children, officials said, warning residents could still be trapped under the rubble.\n\n\"The rescue and search operation continues. All services are working at the scene,\" said regional governor Oleg Synegubov.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pressed Western allies for more air defence fire power.\n\n\"Our top priorities are to ensure more air defence systems for Ukraine, joint defence industry projects, and weapons for our warriors, as well as global efforts to force Russia to make peace,\" he said on social media during a visit to Sweden on Friday.\n\n\"Only together we can stop the madness from Moscow,\" he told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n- 'The advance is underway' -\n\nUkraine has intensified strikes on Russian targets in recent months, claiming drone attacks on military and energy infrastructure targets deep inside the country.\n\nRussia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\nThe increasing intensity of strikes has come as Russian troops have made gradual advances in Ukraine this year after holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive last year.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said Moscow's forces had seized 880 square kilometres (340 square miles) of territory so far in 2024.\n\n\"The advance is underway in all tactical directions,\" he said at a meeting of the Russian-led CSTO security alliance in Almaty, according to Russian news agencies.\n\nbur-dt/jbr/gil\n\nMore from this section\n\nRepublican blocks confirmation of first Native American federal judge for Montana\n\niPhone Won't Turn On or Charge?

as Biden lets Ukraine use US arms inside Russia", "body": "Two Ukrainian servicemen sit facing the 'Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine', a memorial for Ukrainian soldiers, in the center of Kyiv\n\nRussian strikes killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the regional governor said early Friday, hours after the United States authorised Kyiv to use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia in defence of the embattled region.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said in an interview with local media there could be more people trapped under the rubble of the residential building, adding: \"There was not a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nTerekhov later put the number of wounded at 23.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\n- Restrictions lifted -\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defence ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defence (and) drones\".\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\n\"They are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a daily briefing.\n\nbur-juf/smw/cwl\n\nMore from this

That appears to have prompted the change in policy among Western leaders.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people in a nighttime attack.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 12 miles from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 600-mile front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [],

More than a dozen have given similar permission to Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, the most important supplier of weaponry to Ukraine, had been reluctant to take the step, worried about provoking Russia into an escalation that could drag in NATO and set off a wider war. Without sign-off from Washington, the U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, can strike Russian targets only inside Ukraine.\n\nYet many Western leaders and military analysts say that with Russia massing thousands of troops on its side of the border -- less than 20 miles from the northeastern city of Kharkiv -- Ukraine badly needs the authority to strike inside Russia with Western weapons. The permission from Biden is intended solely for Ukraine to attack military sites in Russia being used for the Kharkiv offensive, U.S. officials said.\n\n\"Russian commanders are well aware of Ukraine's inability to strike back,\" Peter Dickinson, a Ukraine analyst at the Atlantic Council in Washington, wrote in an analysis published before Biden's policy change.\n\nOfficials and experts say that launching missiles into Russia, striking its troops, bases, airfields and supply lines, could pay immediate dividends. Indeed, the Ukrainian military already appears to be preparing to launch some initial strikes, \"to test out the Russian response,\" Rafael Loss, a weapons expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nUkraine and the NATO allies have been reluctant to shoulder the risk of changing tactics without U.S. approval, Loss said. \"The United States ultimately would carry a lot of the burden of responding if there was a significant escalation by Russia, for example, against NATO territory,\" he said.\n\nFollowing is a rundown of those countries that have already given permission for Ukraine to use their weapons in Russian territory and those that have not, and the likely impact if Ukraine is granted the freedom to take the fight to Russia.\n\nThose backing strikes on Russian soil\n\nEvery country giving weapons to Ukraine has the right to prescribe how they are used, and so far Britain, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Poland have stated their support for Ukraine being able to hit military targets on Russian soil.\n\nSome nations are more cautious than others. Germany and Sweden, for example, conditioned their approval solely \"within the framework of international law,\" as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz put it Tuesday. He was spelling out a requirement that other countries have also maintained over the last two years of arming Ukraine, even if it was not voiced as prominently.\n\nBritain was one of the first to argue for loosening the restraints. \"Ukraine has that right,\" Foreign Minister David Cameron said during a May 3 visit to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself.\"\n\nThe movement picked up steam when vigorous support by French President Emmanuel Macron helped persuade a more reluctant Germany to reconsider its position this week. \"It's as if we were telling them: 'We're giving you arms but you cannot use them to defend yourself',\" Macron said in Berlin this week, with Scholz by his side.\n\nThose calling for a 'prudent' approach\n\nSeveral countries -- Belgium, Italy and until now, the United States -- had said they were not ready to let Ukraine use their weapons to hit targets inside Russia, citing the risks, which can be hard to anticipate. For example, recent Ukrainian attacks with its own drones on Russia's nuclear early-warning radar systems, a potentially destabilizing step, have raised deep concerns in Washington.\n\nOn Monday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said NATO allies \"must be very prudent\" before Western weapons are used in Russian territory. A day later, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announced the donation of 30 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine -- but only \"for utilization by the Ukraine Defense Forces on Ukraine territory.\"\n\nIn Washington, a White House spokesperson maintained Tuesday that the Biden administration would not \"encourage or enable\" the use of American weapons on Russian soil. But that resistance softened in the face of mounting pressure from its allies, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested the next day that the U.S. might \"adapt and adjust\" its stance based on battlefield conditions.\n\nThe likely impact\n\nWith permission already granted, Ukraine can strike into Russia with Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain and closely related SCALP missiles from France. The missiles have a range of about 150 miles and are fired from Ukraine's aging fleet of Soviet-designed fighter jets.\n\nSeveral countries -- Britain, Germany, Norway and the United States -- have given Ukraine ground-based launchers that can fire longer-range missiles. Those systems are known as HIMARS and MLRS launchers, and they can also shoot the United States' ATACMS, missiles that have a range of up to 190 miles.\n\n\"If they green-light the use of ATACMS, that could degrade Russia's ability to use its territory as a sanctuary for ground operations,\" Loss said.\n\nAdditionally, Britain, Canada and the United States have supplied Ukraine with medium-range missiles or ground-based small diameter bombs that can reach into Russia from 50-90 miles away.\n\nBut the new authorizations may have their greatest impact in the war for air superiority -- especially if the allies allow their donated jets and drones to attack within Russia's air space.\n\nIt is not clear if Denmark or the Netherlands would allow the F-16s they are sending Ukraine to fly over Russian territory, where they could be shot down. In comments this week, Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren appeared to place no specific limits on the weapons given by the Netherlands. \"Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil are something I have never ruled out,\" she said.\n\nAt least four other countries -- Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and North Macedonia -- have provided Soviet-era fighter jets. Britain and Turkey have sent long-range attack drones that also could directly fly into Russia.\n\nAt the least, Loss said, the soon-to-arrive F-16 fleet will come equipped with long-range missiles that could target Russian jets \"from behind their border,\" with implications for Ukraine's future air power.\n\n\"We're not there yet,\" he said, noting that Ukrainian pilots have yet to master the warplane with enough skill to counter Russia's edge. \"But there's some potential for Ukraine's future F-16 fleet to strike into Russian territory.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com",

Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden's decision allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\", one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials stressed that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFirefighters responded after the missile strike (Andrii Marienko/AP)\n\nOne of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them.\n\nThe tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 12 miles from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on February 24 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of 600-mile front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We're going to make sure that it has the equipment it needs to do that.\n\n\"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over these now more than two years has been to adapt,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that. \"\n\nThe shift by Washington comes as more of its partners in Europe have been moving toward dropping their own bans on their weapons being used against targets inside Russia and are looking to the United States, as Ukraine's largest military backer, to take the lead.\n\nEarlier this month, British Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said Ukraine had the right to attack targets on Russian territory and there were no restrictions on how it could employ British-supplied weapons.\n\n\"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" he said during a visit to Kyiv to deliver a British pledge of $3.75 billion annually in military support \"for as long as necessary.\"\n\nCameron, however, stopped short of explicitly authorizing the use of British weapons to strike targets on Russian soil.\n\nBritain has had an understanding with Kyiv that its long-range Storm Shadow missile must only be used within sovereign Ukrainian territory -- although they have been used to attack Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014 and Russia's Black Sea Fleet which is based out of Sevastopol.\n\nRussia rebuked Cameron over his May 2 comments calling them \"another very dangerous claim,\" warning they risked widening the conflict.\n\n\"This is a direct escalation of tension around the Ukrainian conflict, which would potentially pose a threat to European security,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

with US Arms - World news - Tasnim News Agency", "body": "Several US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told multiple media outlets on Thursday that Kyiv would be allowed to use the weapons on the border of the Kharkiv region which came under renewed Russian attack earlier this month.\n\nThe decision marks a policy shift by Biden who had refused to let Kyiv use US weapons beyond Ukraine's borders, and comes as France and other European countries indicated Ukraine would be allowed to use their weapons on military targets inside Russia.\n\nKyiv will be authorized to strike military targets on the border with the Kharkiv region, where Russia has overrun a number of villages since May 10, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official told the Reuters, AFP and The Associated Press news agencies.\n\nAmid the debate, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday warned of \"serious consequences\", stressing his country's nuclear strength, if Ukraine's Western allies loosened their policy.\n\nRussia's RIA agency cited Andrei Kartapolov, the head of the Russian lower house's defense committee, as saying on Friday that Moscow will retaliate asymmetrically to Ukrainian attacks on its territory using weapons provided by the United States.\n\nKartapolov said Biden's decision to allow limited missile strikes inside Russia with US weapons would not impact Russia's military operation in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Kyiv's allies to allow it to use their longer-range weaponry to hit targets on Russian soil amid a surge in attacks this month, particularly on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, some 30 kilometers from

Over the past year, both US and British missiles have been used to target Crimea.\n\nThe news comes a day after Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted that the US was preparing to change the policy, saying the US will \"adapt and adjust\" when asked if Urkaine could strike Russian territory with US weapons.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that the restrictions on Ukraine's use of US weapons were put in place as part of President Biden's plans to \"avoid World War III.\" But throughout the war, the US and other NATO countries have taken escalations they previously ruled out due to fear of provoking Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has warned that any NATO countries that let Ukraine strike Russia with their weapons would face \"major consequences.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

This would include the build-up of Russian troops and equipment along Russia's border near Kharkiv, which is where Ukraine's Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi warned Moscow is now sending additional regiments and brigades.\n\nWhile the United States has not changed its official position, which prohibits U.S.-supplied equipment from attacking Russian sites, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that its policy will continue to be \"adapted and adjusted\" based on battlefield conditions.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has stepped up attacks inside Russia, hitting military sites and energy infrastructure with drones. But there are growing calls from Ukrainian officials to be able use Western-supplied weapons, particularly after Russian troops were able to easily break through Ukraine's defences on May 10, and seized around a dozen small Ukrainian settlements in the Kharkiv region.\n\nWATCH | Allies say Ukraine should be able to use Western weapons to strike inside Russia:\n\nEven before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2002, NATO members had been debating about how to give Kyiv the military help it needs without further inflaming tensions with Russia and kicking off a wider global conflict, potentially even a nuclear one.\n\nIn recent days, Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, warned there would be repercussions if the West \"embarked on a new round of escalation.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Putin said that Europe, especially \"its small countries,\" should be \"aware of what they are playing with.\"\n\nFears of escalating and expanding the conflict are why some NATO countries have been cautious about which weapons systems to supply to Ukraine.\n\nWashington's position has evolved throughout the war. Weapons that officials were initially reluctant to send -- like the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which has a range of 300 kilometres -- are now in Ukraine.\n\n\"We have to get over this. We have to say no systems are off-limits, no use of weapons is off-limits, as long as it conforms to international law,\" said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and currently a distinguished fellow with the Washington, D.C.-based Centre for European Policy Analysis.\n\nVolker, who spoke with CBC News earlier this month during a security conference in Tallinn, Estonia, said many people weigh the risks of escalation, but there are fewer discussions about the risks of not being bold enough.\n\n\"The cost of that is a long war... emboldening Putin by making it clear we don't have the resolve to actually help Ukraine win.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Ukrainian outlet European Pravda published four weeks ago, Latvia's Foreign Minister Baiba Braze said some countries had already provided weapons to Kyiv without any conditions, but that those agreements were not made \"aloud.\"\n\nBefore Russia's incursion on May 10, Ukraine said it had been aware of a buildup of thousands of troops along the border with the Kharkiv region and the neighbouring region of Sumy.\n\nIn the days that followed, more than 9,000 people were evacuated from the area, most of whom were living in the village of Vovchansk, which lies 45 km from the city of Kharkiv, and is now nearly destroyed, according to the head of the local military administration.\n\nWATCH | Kharkiv photographer has been documenting Russia's war on Ukraine:\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the Washington Post on Thursday, a commander of a Ukrainian drone unit said they were being forced to defend Ukraine with \"one hand tied behind\" their backs, because they are unable to use Western munitions to strike Russian troops and equipment positioned 30 to 40 kilometres behind the Russian border.\n\nAn assessment published on May 13 by the Institute for the Study of War argued the U.S.prohibition on the use of its weapons beyond Ukraine's border had created a \"vast sanctuary\" for Russia.\n\nIt routinely strikes the Kharkiv region, including the city of Kharkiv, with glide bombs that experts say are difficult to defend against, as under current U.S. rules, Ukraine can't intercept Russian planes in Russian airspace with U.S.-provided air defence systems.\n\nThe ISW argues the U.S. doesn't need to lift all of its restrictions on the use of its weapons inside Russia, but should allow Ukrainian forces to at least \"defend themselves against immediate operational assaults.\"\n\nVolker said the guiding principle should be international law.\n\n\"It requires that you have proportionality and that you fire against military targets, not against civilian ones,\" he said. \"That should be the standard to which Ukraine is held.\"\n\nWhile several NATO members have spoken publicly about allowing Ukraine to launch Western-supplied weapons into Russia, Italy's foreign minister told an Italian news outlet on Thursday that weapons given by Italy should only be used in Ukraine.\n\nAs pressure from its European allies mounts, the U.S. is getting ready to host the next NATO summit in July.\n\nIn an interview with CBC's Power and Politics earlier this week, retired Canadian general and former chief of the defence staff Tom Lawson said he believes all of the recent statements from Western officials may be a part of a U.S. attempt to gauge Russia's reaction. \"I actually think that they are asking nations like Canada to throw out these trial balloons to see what kind of response comes back from Russia,\" Lawson said.\n\n\"I think this is in anticipation of what will take place in July at the summit.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type":

This is part of President Putin's efforts to prevent NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said, before the start of a NATO meeting in Prague.\n\nNATO foreign ministers will meet in the Czech capital on Friday to prepare for this summer's leaders' summit as the alliance boosts support for Ukraine and countries one-by-one remove restrictions on how Kyiv can use western-supplied weaponry to combat Russia's invasion.\n\nA day after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use American munitions to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv,** numerous ministers, including those from the Netherlands, Finland, Poland and Germany, expressed approval of the decision, saying that Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself from attacks originating on Russian soil.\n\nThe chorus of allied voices backing greater leeway for Ukraine to use their weapons grew louder in recent weeks after Russia launched artillery strikes on Kharkiv from its territory, prompting appeals for help from Kyiv. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted strongly this week that a change in Washington's position was coming.\n\n\"This is a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defence,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. \"Russia has attacked Ukraine, (which) has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\n\n\"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\"\n\nUkrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometres from the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nThe alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defence.", "source":

But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv, and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed.\n\nPolitico was first to report the news.\n\nKyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nThe administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or 300 kilometers, away.\n\nUkraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration's tact this week when he noted that the US could \"adapt and adjust\" its position.\n\n\"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too,\" Blinken said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia.\n\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \"So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we're seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\"\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" Macron continued.\n\nGermany's Scholz echoed Macron's comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people in a night-time attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the country's second-largest city.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nA Russian onslaught this month in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including a Russian aerial bomb attack on a large construction supplies store that killed 18 people on May 25, has forced the evacuation of thousands of people and has stretched Ukraine's depleted forces in what is proving to be a critical period in the war, which is now in its third year.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials,\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThat restriction has frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military is unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news",

Biden has given Ukraine the go-ahead to use American weaponry to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, officials said. Alex Brandon/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Biden has given Ukraine the go-ahead to use American weaponry to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, underscored that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nBiden's directive allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official said.\n\nThe move comes as Ukrainian officials have stepped up calls on the U.S. administration to allow its forces to defend itself against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 12 miles from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelensky, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nDuring Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelensky made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nBlinken was convinced and took that message back to Washington, but it was ultimately Biden's decision to make, the officials said.\n\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington could alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them in attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv during a tour of a Czech military base.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he added. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, Stoltenberg said, \"includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelensky is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend to attend the D-Day commemorations.\n\nLee reported from Prague.

He was responding to a question about whether Biden would soon allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons to strike in Russia. It was a strong suggestion that the president was making the decision to give permission to Ukraine.\n\nThe leaders of NATO, France and Germany had recently urged the United States to make that decision. In internal administration discussions, Blinken has advocated moving in that direction. He is attending a NATO meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday and visited Ukraine more than two weeks ago.\n\nThe decision by Biden was reported earlier Thursday by Politico.\n\nThe Pentagon is charged with giving Ukraine the exact guidelines of what it can strike in Russia, U.S. officials said.\n\nIn addition to artillery and missile launchers, the Ukrainians are concerned about Russian aircraft releasing glide bombs at Kharkiv from inside Russian airspace. Glide bombs are simple munitions fitted with fins. Ukrainian officials say they want to use American-made weapons to attack Russian aircraft in Russia's airspace and air bases inside Russia.", "source": {"uri": "nytlicensing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spokesman.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moldova"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Moldova"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/LCf9awgBXTkp6gK4lvc7JsKaIC4=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/30/665901772a1b9.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

This support follows discussions with allies and comes amid scrutiny on Chancellor Scholz's stance. NATO's Jens Stoltenberg backs Ukraine's right to strike Russian military targets.\n\nGermany said on Friday Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against Ukraine's northern border region around the city of Kharkiv in accordance with international law.\n\nGermany has discussed with its allies Russian strikes on the Kharkiv region from positions in the immediately adjacent Russian border area, a government spokesperson said. \"We are jointly convinced that Ukraine has the right, guaranteed under international law, to defend itself against these attacks,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"To do so, it can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations; including those supplied by us.\" The statement came after days of scrutiny of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government over whether it had changed its stance on allowing Kyiv to use German weapons to strike into Russian territory.\n\nSpeaking in Prague on Friday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\n\nalso spoke in favour of Ukraine using weapons provided by Western countries to strike legitimate military targets inside Russian territory. German officials have declined publicly to divulge specifics on how it would like Ukraine to deploy Western-supplied weapons, wary of rhetoric that could ratchet up tensions at a time when Russia is threatening tactical nuclear strikes against Ukraine.\n\nThe majority of weapons already delivered to Ukraine by Germany are not suitable for attacks on Russian positions well behind the frontline. Self-propelled howitzers, for example, can engage targets at a distance of up to 56 kilometres (35 miles), but are not deployed in the immediate vicinity of the front. France, Britain and the United States have supplied Ukraine with weapons with greater target ranges.\n\nBerlin's statement came a day after U.S. officials suggested President Joe Biden had quietly shifted policy to allow Kyiv to fire U.S.-supplied weapons at targets inside Russia but only near the border with the Kharkiv region. Previously Biden had steadfastly refused to let Ukraine use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.\n\nThe calls to allow the use of Western weapons against missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia come as Moscow is claiming territorial gains in a cross-border offensive on the region surrounding Ukraine's second biggest city.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted strongly this week that a change in Washington's position was coming.\n\n\"This is a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. \"Russia has attacked Ukraine, (which) has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\n\n\"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\"\n\nUkrainian officials had stepped up calls on the U.S. administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Soils", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Soils", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/gOtMc7iwy9BlpIBgLTh5kCzPSDE=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/KE7FJQHX7H33VQZJQKBZUEWTN4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It has (...) been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, US President Joe Biden has also authorised Kyiv the limited use of US-supplied weapons inside Russia.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages.\n\nThe US is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is 30km from the border with Russia.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Of course it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict.\n\n\"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nFollowing Putin's warning, the US decision on weapons prompted senior Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev to say Moscow was not bluffing when it spoke of the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine and that its conflict with the West could escalate into an all-out war.",

from a desperate Ukraine to ease his ban, but had so far resisted amid fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict or even a nuclear standoff with Moscow.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said.\n\n\"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the official said on condition of anonymity, referring to long-range missiles recently sent by Washington to Kyiv.\n\nA second US official confirmed Biden's change of policy, which comes as Russian forces push forward with an offensive against the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Kyiv's supporters -- chiefly the United States -- to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets on Russian soil.\n\nThe United States has been rushing to get arms to Ukraine after Congress passed a huge military aid package following a six-month delay in April, but Biden had been reluctant to allow cross-border strikes.\n\nHowever US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden was changing course in response, saying that Washington had \"adapted and adjusted.\"\n\nBiden's shift followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials in the days after Russia launched its Kharkiv offensive on May 10.\n\nUkraine asked for permission to use US arms on Russian territory on May 13, and Biden agreed in principle on May 15 after National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made the case for Ukraine to be able to defend itself.\n\nBiden then met on May 17 with Blinken, who traveled to Kyiv earlier this month to see the increasingly grave situation as Russia pushes towards Kharkiv, and had been widely reported to be pressing Biden to ease the rules.\n\nAfter working through the details, the US president gave a final sign-off in recent days but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe White House has however made it clear to Kyiv that the permission for cross-border attacks was limited to targets just over the border, and which were being used by Russia to launch offensives.\n\nOfficials also insisted that they had been expecting some form of Russian offensive, and that with the influx of US arms, it has been stalled, preventing the possible capture of Kharkiv city.\n\nPressure had been mounting for Biden and other Western countries to end their ban on Ukraine using their weapons to strike Russian soil.\n\nAhead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralize\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nSome countries including Britain and the Netherlands had already said Kyiv has the right to use their weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\n\nBiden's change also comes shortly before he heads to Europe for a series of meetings where Kyiv's plight will be in focus.\n\nBiden will attend ceremonies in France marking the World War II D-Day landings in early June where Ukraine's Zelensky will also be present.\n\nThe US president will also meet leaders of the world's top economies at the G7 summit in Italy.\n\nBut Zelensky has criticized Biden for apparently planning to skip a Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland just after the G7, which clashes with an election fundraiser for the US president hosted by Hollywood stars George Clooney and Julia Roberts.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"},

White House officials insisted, however, that the authorisation extended only to what they characterised as acts of self-defence, so that Ukraine could protect Kharkiv, its second-largest city, and the surrounding areas in the northeast from relentless fire from missiles, glide bombs and artillery shells from just over the border.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said in a statement issued by the administration. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the statement continued, referring to an artillery system, provided to Ukraine, that has the capability to reach deep inside Russian territory.\n\nInside the White House, Mr Biden's deliberations were closely held, known only to a very narrow group of aides. But the New York Times revealed last week that secretary of state Antony Blinken had come back from a sobering trip to Kyiv and privately told the president that his 27-month-long ban against shooting American weapons into Russian territory was now placing parts of Ukraine in peril. The Russians, he said, were exploiting the president's ban and mounting constant attacks from a safe haven just inside the Russian border.\n\nBy that time, Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, had also begun changing his view, senior officials said. So had US allies: Britain weeks ago allowed Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow long-range missile systems for attacks anywhere in Russia, and France and Germany recently took the same position. So did Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of Nato.\n\nThe decision follows weeks of discussion with the Ukrainians after Russia began a major assault on Kharkiv.\n\nBecause Kharkiv is so close to Russia, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly pressed Mr Biden and his aides for the right to strike back inside Russia. Mr Biden deflected those requests for months, concerned that using American weapons could escalate the conflict - and put the United States into a direct confrontation with Russia.\n\nWhen he relented, it was in the most narrowly prescribed way. The permission from Mr Biden is intended solely for Ukraine to strike military sites in Russia being used to attack the Kharkiv area, US officials said. Attacks from Russia in other regions - even near Kyiv, the capital -cannot be answered with the use of American weapons.\n\nA senior US official in Washington said the administration's policy prohibiting Ukraine from using US-made weapons for \"long range\" attacks inside Russia had not changed.\n\nThe decision by Mr Biden was reported earlier Thursday by Politico.\n\nThe Pentagon is charged with giving Ukraine the exact guidelines of what it can strike in Russia, US officials said. Those have already been conveyed by secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin III to Gen Christopher G Cavoli, the four-star commander of the US European Command and the supreme allied commander for Europe. It was Gen Cavoli who conveyed the decision to Ukraine, officials said. - This article originally appeared in The New York Times", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Self-propelled howitzers, for example, can engage targets at a distance of up to 56 kilometres (35 miles), but are not deployed in the immediate vicinity of the front.\n\nFrance, Britain and the United States have supplied Ukraine with weapons with greater target ranges.\n\nBerlin's statement came a day after U.S. officials suggested President Joe Biden had quietly shifted policy to allow Kyiv to fire U.S.-supplied weapons at targets inside Russia but only near the border with the Kharkiv region.\n\nPreviously Biden had steadfastly refused to let Ukraine use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.\n\nThe calls to allow the use of Western weapons against missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia come as Moscow is claiming territorial gains in a cross-border offensive on the region surrounding Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nWriting by Friederike Heine and Matthias Williams, Editing by Rachel More and Gareth Jones", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 km (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRead Also | Russia finalising work on 'retaliatory measures' against EU over ban on some Russian media\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nThe alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support.

All services are working at the scene,\" said Oleg Synyegubov, Head of Kharkiv Region Military Administration.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nThe city is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in Kharkiv last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\nRestrictions lifted\n\nA US official said Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons or counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them.\"\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days, but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He and Ukrainian government officials had for weeks urged Washington to lift the restrictions, arguing that it was \"unfair\" that they were prohibited from striking military targets while Moscow's forces pounded civilian targets in Ukraine.\n\n\"The most important and immediate effect is that Ukraine will be able to strike targets at greater depths with Himars GMLRS munitions, including Russian artillery, electronic warfare, air defences and command posts,\" said Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Eurasia Program.\n\n\"Before now, Ukraine has been forced to move artillery too close to the front to engage targets at greater depth, which put them at greater risk.\"\n\nBut the US president's move on Thursday falls short of a sweeping greenlight for Ukraine to use US weapons to strike everywhere inside Russia.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on Thursday. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of Atacms or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the official added, referring to a US ballistic missile system.\n\nSince the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Biden has opposed the use of US weapons to strike inside Russian territory for fear of escalating the conflict and drawing the US and Nato directly into war with Moscow.\n\nBut in recent weeks the president has been weighing a partial change to that policy in light of the Russian offensive in Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east.\n\nMoscow opened a new front in the region earlier this month, sending more than 30,000 ground forces into Ukraine from Russia's Belgorod region, according to Oleksandr Lytvynenko, Ukrainian national security and defence council secretary.\n\nRussia seized roughly a dozen Ukrainian villages and laid waste to the town of Vovchansk as it moved to create a so-called buffer zone that Lytvynenko said is meant to keep Kyiv's forces from launching attacks across the border.\n\nRussia has used warplanes and ground launchers to fire powerful glide bombs, missiles and heavy artillery at Kharkiv city and surrounding areas, killing dozens of civilians as it pounds targets just across the border.\n\nBiden's move comes as he prepares to travel to Europe next week for the 80th commemoration of D-Day in Normandy, and a state visit to Paris hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has backed Ukraine's ability to strike targets inside Russia with western weapons.\n\nThe Financial Times has also reported that Biden and Zelenskyy will sign a bilateral security deal at a G7 summit in Italy next later in June, cementing long-term defence ties between the US and Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial

The fourth and fifth floors of one of the building's sections were completely destroyed,\" police said in a statement, adding that another munition killed a guard at a civilian production facility.\n\nRegional Governor Oleg Synegubov noted in a Telegram post that an emergency medic was among the wounded, adding: \"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot.\"\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, an oil depot was damaged in an aerial attack, its governor said Friday morning, noting that a major drone incursion elsewhere in the region had been repelled by air defences.\n\n\"The situation is more serious in Temryuk district -- the oil depot infrastructure there was damaged by an air strike. Three tanks with petroleum products were damaged and are on fire,\" Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram, adding some workers had been wounded.\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend Kharkiv.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days, but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe White House has made it clear to Kyiv that the permission for cross-border attacks was limited to targets just over the border that were being used to launch offensives.\n\nAhead of a NATO meeting in Prague on Thursday, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had also insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\nThe Pentagon, meanwhile, released a new report Wednesday citing debris analysis to confirm long-standing allegations that North Korea has been supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine.\n\nThe report by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency used open-source imagery to confirm that debris found in the Kharkiv region in January was from a short-range ballistic missile made in North Korea.\n\n\"North Korean missile debris was found throughout Ukraine,\" the report said.\n\nSouth Korea has accused Pyongyang of sending thousands of containers of munitions to Russia, which would violate rafts of UN sanctions on both countries.\n\nThe powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month called the allegations \"absurd\".\n\nBut experts say a recent weapons testing spree in North Korea may be for munitions destined for use in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [],

The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Of course it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\n\"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/RZIYBREH6BHX3PPJWU4EC67E5I.JPG?auth=593d6037e2e66f5fdfe870d7ed84dec18bf7f6b9e205cf7b3a4345057ebc102a&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1197, "textEnd": 1203}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Ukrainian authorities have not sought permission for strikes beyond this region.\n\nThe request for this policy change was made by Kyiv in response to the advancing Russian forces in recent weeks, the official confirmed. Ukrainian forces are now empowered to target Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nNevertheless, the Biden administration has maintained its stance against allowing Ukraine to utilize its most formidable munitions, including the long-range ATACMS missiles, which have a range of up to 200 miles (300 kilometers).\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken hinted at the possibility of adjusting the administration's approach earlier this week. \"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed,\" Blinken remarked during a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe shift in policy aligns with recent statements from European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Macron emphasised the need for Ukraine to neutralise military sites within Russia that pose a threat to Ukrainian territory. \"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron stated.\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.\"\n\nScholz echoed Macron's sentiments, affirming that Ukraine has the right to defend itself within the parameters set by the countries supplying the weapons and international law.

One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nA Russian onslaught this month in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including a Russian aerial bomb attack on a large construction supplies store that killed 18 people on May 25, has forced the evacuation of thousands of people and has stretched Ukraine's depleted forces in what is proving to be a critical period in the war, which is now in its third year.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials,\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThat restriction has frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military is unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War Two.\n\n\"I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,\" said US Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with Nato?\"\n\nConnolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to use US weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.\n\nFor some time, critics have urged Nato allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offencive.\n\nCountries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.\n\nBiden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a Nato summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.\n\n[embed]https://twitter.com/BRICSinfo/status/1794422625571393724[/embed]", "source":

The U.S., however, is not alone in reconsidering its previous decision not to allow Ukraine to use its weapons to hit targets in Russia.\n\nBiden's new policy allows for Ukrainian forces to hit Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv and at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, though they are still not permitted to hit civilian infrastructure or hit targets deep inside Russian territory.\n\n\"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a State Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long range strikes inside of Russia has not changed.\"\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken hinted that the president was shifting his stance a day earlier.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"We're going to make sure that it has the equipment it needs to do that. And another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over these now more than two years has been to adapt. As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" the secretary said.\n\nMultiple NATO countries have announced publicly that Ukraine could use its military assistance to hit targets inside Russian territory this month despite continued hesitation from others. France, Canada, and the United Kingdom have said Ukraine can use their weapons to hit targets in Russia as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and NATO have sought to avoid escalating tension with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly issued threats of nuclear escalation.\n\nBiden has shifted his thinking several times during the war, most often loosening previous restrictions or deciding to provide Ukraine with weapons the U.S. had been previously opposed to giving the country at all.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Ukrainian forces have suffered setbacks in the country's northeastern region, apparently prompting the policy reversal, but some Ukraine skeptics have cautioned that allowing strikes inside Russia with U.S. weapons could invite unwelcome and serious escalation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" one U.S. official told Politico. The official added that the administration's policy of not permitting long-range strikes inside Russia's borders \"has not changed.\"\n\nUkrainian forces can now use U.S. weaponry to counter Russian missiles bound for Kharkiv, fire upon soldiers assembling inside Russia to attack nearby Kharkiv, or take down Russian bombers attacking Ukraine, according to Politico. However, the new stance will reportedly not allow Ukraine to use that firepower to target civilian infrastructure or launch long-range attacks against military installations further in the Russian interior.\n\nThe Biden administration had previously asserted that allowing Ukrainian strikes inside Russia with U.S.-provided weaponry could prompt Putin to escalate or broaden the conflict, according to Politico. However, the deteriorating situation around Kharkiv reportedly forced the administration to change its mind, especially as Ukrainian officials have emphasized their need to disrupt the buildup of troops pouring into the northeast from just over the border.\n\nOther U.S. allies that have contributed to Ukraine's war effort, including France and the U.K., have previously argued that the Ukrainians should be able to use weapons provided by the West to strike inside Russia's borders, according to Politico. Russia has cautioned that NATO risks escalation if the alliance permits Ukraine to use provided weapons to attack inside Russia, with Putin warning that allowing such attacks could \"lead to serious consequences.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) declined to comment, and referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to the National Security Council (NSC).

U.S. Arms To Defend Kharkiv - Official", "body": "President Joe Biden has lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the under-fire Kharkiv region, U.S. officials said Thursday.\n\nBiden has come under increasing pressure from a desperate Ukraine to ease his ban but had so far resisted amid fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the official said, referring to long-range missiles recently sent by Washington to Kyiv.\n\nA second U.S. official confirmed Biden's change of policy.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Kyiv's supporters -- chiefly the United States -- to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets on Russian soil.\n\nSome countries including Britain and the Netherlands say Kyiv has the right to use their weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed,\" as he spoke to reporters on a visit to Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nBlinken, who traveled to Kyiv earlier this month to see the increasingly grave situation as Russia pushes forward towards Kharkiv, had been widely reported to be pressing Biden to ease the rules.\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, which starts with a dinner on Thursday, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits because they hampered Kyiv's ability to defend itself.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralize\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nPressure has also been mounting ahead of a series of key meetings in Europe in the coming weeks where Kyiv's plight will be in focus.\n\nBiden will attend ceremonies in France marking the World War II D-Day landings in early June where Ukraine's Zelensky will also be present.\n\nThe U.S. president will also meet leaders of the world's top economies at the G7 summit in

Blinken told reporters traveling with him in Moldova that the United States would \"adapt and adjust\" to battlefield conditions. He was responding to a question about whether Mr. Biden would soon allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons to strike in Russia.

dramatically in previous weeks, killing dozens and leaving thousands without electricity.\n\nTerekhov said that unless the West steps up and delivers crucial air defence systems - Kharkiv could suffer the same fate as the Syrian city of Aleppo, which heavy Russian bombing helped to decimate a decade ago.\n\nLast Saturday, at least 18 people were killed after a Russian missile strike hit a retail

We have had enough of this, and it is more than eloquent evidence of the extent of the United States' involvement in this conflict.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague, key European allies pressed to lift restrictions. On Thursday, the White House said Biden did just that, granting Ukrainian forces the ability to hit back at Russian forces attacking them in and around Kharkiv.\n\nThe shift grants Ukraine permission to use U.S.-provided artillery and rocket launchers to hit Russian troops and equipment just across the border from Kharkiv and to strike missiles headed toward Ukrainian territory, according to U.S. officials. They stressed that the Biden administration's policy barring longer-range strikes inside Russia has not changed.\n\nAfter the U.S. announcement, Germany, a holdout, quickly followed suit, saying Ukrainian soldiers have the right to use German weapons to hit back. \"In recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks, particularly in the Kharkiv area, from positions in the immediately adjacent Russian border area,\" Germany said in a statement.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement continued. \"To this end, [Ukraine] can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations, including those supplied by us.\"\n\nIn recent months, dire conditions on the battlefield have pushed Ukraine's supporters to consider options once deemed too escalatory.\n\nIn February, French President Emmanuel Macron surprised many by saying \"no option should be discarded\" in response to a question about sending Western troops to Ukraine.\n\nIn recent days, top Ukrainian officials have said they are in discussions with Paris about sending French military trainers to Ukraine. Macron is expected to announce plans for sending the trainers when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visits France on Thursday for a D-Day commemoration.\n\nThe Biden administration has long ruled out the idea of U.S. troops in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hudson@washingtonpost.com", "name":

It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorized Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE\n\nRussian jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nIn Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical borders on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ... Ukraine has the right to defend itself according to the rules of humanitarian law.\"", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We're defending Ukraine and it is not the same,\" he said.\n\n'Stop the madness'\n\nA US official said yesterday that President Joe Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons or counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\".\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective yesterday.\n\nThe change in Washington's thinking was attributed by US officials to Russia's daily pounding of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nIn the latest Russian strikes on the city overnight, five people were killed and 23 wounded, including two children, officials said, warning residents could still be trapped under the rubble.\n\n\"The rescue and search operation continues. All services are working at the scene,\" said regional governor Oleg Synegubov.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pressed Western allies for more air defence fire power.\n\n\"Our top priorities are to ensure more air defence systems for Ukraine, joint defence industry projects, and weapons for our warriors, as well as global efforts to force Russia to make peace,\" he said on social media during a visit to Sweden today.\n\n\"Only together we can stop the madness from Moscow,\" he told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n'The advance is underway'\n\nUkraine has intensified strikes on Russian targets in recent months, claiming drone attacks on military and energy infrastructure targets deep inside the country.\n\nRussia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\nThe increasing intensity of strikes has come as Russian troops have made gradual advances in Ukraine this year after holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive last year.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said Moscow's forces had seized 880 square kilometres of territory so far in 2024.\n\n\"The advance is underway in all tactical directions,\" he said at a meeting of the Russian-led CSTO security alliance in Almaty, according to Russian news

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted strongly this week that a change in Washington's position was coming.\n\n\"This is a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. \"Russia has attacked Ukraine, (which) has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\n\n\"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\"\n\nUkrainian officials had stepped up calls on the U.S. administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nThe alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ukrainian authorities have not sought permission for strikes beyond this region.\n\nThe request for this policy change was made by Kyiv in response to the advancing Russian forces in recent weeks, the official confirmed. Ukrainian forces are now empowered to target Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nNevertheless, the Biden administration has maintained its stance against allowing Ukraine to utilize its most formidable munitions, including the long-range ATACMS missiles, which have a range of up to 200 miles (300 kilometers), as reported by CNN.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken hinted at the possibility of adjusting the administration's approach earlier this week. \"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed,\" Blinken remarked during a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe shift in policy aligns with recent statements from European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Macron emphasised the need for Ukraine to neutralise military sites within Russia that pose a threat to Ukrainian territory. \"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron stated.\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.\"\n\nScholz echoed Macron's sentiments, affirming that Ukraine has the right to defend itself within the parameters set by the countries supplying the weapons and international law, CNN reported.

Speaking at a meeting in Prague, Stoltenberg reaffirmed NATO's support for Ukraine's self-defense against Russia's invasion, challenging Putin's threats as an old tactic.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Friday dismissed warnings by Russian President Vladimir Putin that allowing Kyiv to use Western weapons for strikes inside Russian territory might lead to an escalation. Speaking on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Prague, Stoltenberg said the alliance had heard such warnings many times before.\n\n\"This is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters. \"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv. In a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorized Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE Russian jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back. \"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law. In Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical borders on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine. Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters. His comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ... Ukraine has the right to defend itself according to the rules of humanitarian law.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

The fourth and fifth floors of one of the building's sections were completely destroyed,\" police said in a statement, adding that another munition killed a guard at a civilian production facility.\n\nRegional Governor Oleg Synegubov noted in a Telegram post that an emergency medic was among the wounded, adding: \"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot.\"\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, an oil depot was damaged in an aerial attack, its governor said this morning, noting that a major drone incursion elsewhere in the region had been repelled by air defences.\n\n\"The situation is more serious in Temryuk district - the oil depot infrastructure there was damaged by an air strike. Three tanks with petroleum products were damaged and are on fire,\" Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram, adding some workers had been wounded.\n\nRestrictions lifted\n\nUS officials said Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend Kharkiv.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days, but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nThe White House has made it clear to Kyiv that the permission for cross-border attacks was limited to targets just over the border that were being used to launch offensives.\n\nAhead of a NATO meeting in Prague on Thursday, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had also insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of \"entering a new round of escalations in tensions\" in recent days.\n\nNorth Korean weapons\n\nThe Pentagon, meanwhile, released a new report Wednesday citing debris analysis to confirm long-standing allegations that North Korea has been supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine.\n\nThe report by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency used open-source imagery to confirm that debris found in the Kharkiv

of sending thousands of containers of munitions to Russia, which would violate rafts of UN sanctions on both countries.\n\nThe powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month called the allegations \"absurd\".\n\nBut experts say a recent weapons testing spree in North Korea may be for munitions destined for use in Ukraine.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse", "source": {"uri":

All services are working at the scene,\" said Oleg Synyegubov, Head of Kharkiv Region Military Administration.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nThe city is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in Kharkiv last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nMore from this section Fed Reserve President Kashkari Wants 'Many More Months' of Inflation Progress Before Cutting Rates Putin Declares Zelensky's Rule Illegitimate, Asserts Ukrainian Parliament Sole Authority Menendez bribery trial: Jurors see texts sent between senator and wife regarding Egyptian military aid\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\n- Restrictions lifted -\n\nA US official said Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons or counter-fire\n\npurposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them.\"\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days, but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday.\n\nbur-juf/smw/cwl/gv/db", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Following President Biden's approval, allies are backing Ukraine's right to defend itself against Russian attacks from Russian soil. Discussions highlighted Ukraine's pressing need for advanced weapons amidst the ongoing conflict.\n\nNATO foreign ministers were meeting in the Czech capital Friday to prepare for this summer's leaders' summit as the alliance boosts support for Ukraine and countries one-by-one remove restrictions on how Kyiv can use western-supplied weaponry to combat Russia's invasion.\n\nA day after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use American munitions to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, numerous ministers, including those from the Netherlands, Finland, Poland and Germany, expressed approval of the decision, saying that Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself from attacks originating on Russian soil.\n\nThe chorus of allied voices backing greater leeway for Ukraine to use their weapons grew louder in recent weeks after Russia launched artillery strikes on Kharkiv from its territory, prompting appeals for help from Kyiv. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted strongly this week that a change in Washington's position was coming.\n\n\"This is a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defence,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. \"Russia has attacked Ukraine, (which) has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\" \"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\" Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 km (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nThe alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\n(This story

Earlier, Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration over restrictions on the use of Western weapons -- especially as the border region of Kharkiv has endured a Russian onslaught this month that has stretched Kyiv's outgunned and outmanned forces.\n\nBoth Germany and the U.S. specifically authorized defense of Kharkiv, whose capital city of the same name lies only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia.

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said late on May 29 that there was \"no change to our policy.\"\n\nThe decision would be a reversal of the U.S. refusal to let Ukraine use American weapons to hit targets inside Russia over fears that it would cause an escalation in the conflict.

This is part of the right for self-defense,\" Jens Stoltenberg said at the doorstep of the Foreign Ministers Meeting in the Czech capital Prague.\n\nAsked about reports that US President Joe Biden has granted Ukraine secret approval to use US-supplied weapons to strike inside of Russia, the NATO chief said he welcomes that NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine in many different ways, but added that he \"will not go into the details about exactly what type of support they are getting.\"\n\nUS permission is intended to help Kyiv better defend against Russian attacks on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the Politico news website reported on Thursday, citing two Biden administration officials, and two people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"What I have stated many times is that we need to remember this is a war of aggression. Russia has attacked another country, violated international law, invaded Ukraine, and Ukraine has the right for self-defense and that includes also the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia,\" he noted.\n\nHe went on to say that this has become even \"more urgent,\" as Russia just opened a new front on the northeastern border, attacking the Kharkiv region.\n\nAsked about how lifting restrictions on using donated weapons could change the situation on the ground, Stoltenberg said several allies have never been imposed restrictions on the supply they have delivered to Ukraine.\n\n\"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukrainian soil from Russian soil, with artillery with missiles ... and of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they're not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks,\" said the NATO chief.\n\nOn the recent Ukrainian attack on Russian nuclear radar stations, he said: \"I will not go into the details except for saying that of course we all assume that this will be done in a responsible way.\"\n\n'More, sustained support for Ukraine'\n\nSeparately, speaking at a joint news conference with US Secretary Antony Blinken ahead of the meeting, Stoltenberg underlined that one of the hot topics of the summit is ensuring more and sustained support for Ukraine.\n\n\"I also proposed a multiyear financial pledge to ensure more accountability and predictability in the support we provide to Ukraine because we need to make sure that Moscow understands that we are prepared for the long haul in our support for Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nStoltenberg added that consolidating the alliance's global partnerships, in particular with Asia-Pacific partners Australia and New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, and improving its deterrence and capabilities will be also discussed.\n\nBlinken, for his part, praised NATO as the most successful alliance in history and said they are working to further improve the alliance's deterrence. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This decision comes in response to escalating tensions as Russian forces make substantial advances near Kharkiv, a city in northeastern Ukraine close to the Russian border, according to sources briefed on the matter.\n\nUnder the newly issued directive, Ukraine is permitted to retaliate against Russian forces or targets situated near Kharkiv using weaponry supplied by the United States. One official disclosed, \"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counterfire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them.\"\n\nHowever, this policy adjustment is specifically confined to the vicinity of Kharkiv, with no intentions to expand the permitted area, the official emphasized. Ukrainian authorities have not requested permission for strikes beyond this region.\n\nThe request for this policy change originated from Kyiv in response to the advancing Russian forces in recent weeks, the official confirmed.

desperate Ukraine to ease his ban, but had so far resisted amid fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict or even a nuclear standoff with Moscow.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has threatened \"serious consequences\" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia.\n\n\"I welcome that allies are providing support to Ukraine in many different ways, but I will not go into the details,\" Stoltenberg told journalists at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, and that includes also the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia.\"\n\nThe head of the Western military alliance said letting Western weapons hit targets in Russia was \"nothing new\" as Britain had long sent cruise missiles to Kyiv without restrictions.\n\n\"It has also been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support for Ukraine threatening us to not do that,\" he said.\n\n\"This is part of efforts by President Putin and Moscow to prevent NATO allies from supporting Ukraine to defend themselves, and, again, Ukraine has the right for self-defence and we have the right to help Ukraine.\"\n\nPressure had been building on key backer Biden to shift his position on Ukrainian strikes in Russia after French President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv should be able to hit back against

Agencies\n\nThe United States has authorised Ukraine to use American-made weapons for strikes within Russian territory, specifically targeting forces involved in Moscow's offensive in Ukraine's Kharkiv region. This decision, approved by President Joe Biden, marks a departure from Washington's previous stance. We look at the reason behind this policy change and whether it will have a significant impact on the war.\n\nThe decision and conditions attached\n\nBiden's recent decision allows Ukraine to use some of the American-made weapons it is receiving as military aid to strike Russian territories. The condition is that Ukraine can only use these advanced weapons on troops directly involved in the offensive in Kharkiv.\n\nThis move enables Ukraine to use weapons such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) for deeper and more effective strikes. However, restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, such as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) inside Russia, remain in place.\n\nIn addition to the US, European allies have pledged increased support for Ukraine. France is reportedly considering sending military trainers, and Western nations are working to boost artillery production and procurement to sustain Ukraine's defence efforts. This collective support aims to bolster Ukraine's ability to resist Russian advances and protect its territory.\n\nWhy the restrictions were initially in place\n\nInitially, the US imposed strict limitations on Ukraine's use of American weapons to avoid direct confrontation with Russia and prevent the conflict from expanding. The fear was that strikes within Russian territory could provoke a broader war, drawing NATO and the US into direct military conflict with Moscow.\n\nHowever, the dynamics of the war have compelled a reassessment of this policy. Russia's aggressive moves in Kharkiv and their use of powerful weaponry against civilian targets have intensified the urgency for Ukraine to respond more robustly. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have argued that the restrictions hampered their ability to counter Russian offensives effectively.\n\nThe US administration, after consulting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other allies, decided to refine its approach to balance support for Ukraine while managing the risks of escalation.\n\nMounting pressure from both Ukrainian officials and international allies was partially responsible for the change in Washington's policy. Kyiv has argued that it is unfair to restrict their use of US weapons while Russian forces continue to target Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Allies like the UK, Germany, France, and NATO Secretary General had echoed these sentiments, advocating for Ukraine's right to defend itself fully.\n\nCurrent situation in Russia-Ukraine war\n\nAs of late May, the Russian military has been transferring additional regiments and brigades to northern Kharkiv Oblast, specifically around Strilecha-Lyptsi and Vovchansk, according to Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi. Despite these reinforcements, Russian forces reportedly lack the strength to launch a full-scale offensive capable of breaking through Ukrainian defences, according to Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkrainian officials have noted that Russian forces aim to fix Ukrainian troops in the north and maintain their offensive momentum. Since early May, Russia has deployed over 30,000 ground troops from the Belgorod region, seizing several villages and destroying Vovchansk in an attempt to create a buffer zone.\n\nRussia's strategy includes using warplanes, glide bombs, missiles, and heavy artillery to bombard Kharkiv city and surrounding areas, resulting in significant civilian casualties. This escalation has prompted the US to reconsider its restrictions and offer more substantial support to Ukraine.\n\nExpected impact on the war\n\nThe authorisation for Ukraine to use HIMARS and other American-made weapons for strikes within Russian territory is expected to have several implications for the war. Firstly, it enhances Ukraine's ability to target and neutralise Russian artillery, multiple rocket systems, UAV teams, and command posts, potentially disrupting Russian operations and reducing the pressure on Ukrainian defences in Kharkiv.\n\nRob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Eurasia program, told Financial Times that while the change might not immediately alter the frontline dynamics, it will complicate Russia's offensive efforts. By enabling more effective strikes at greater depths, Ukraine can better defend Kharkiv and possibly slow down Russian advancements.\n\nThe Biden administration believes that the resumption of US armed supplies, coupled with improved defensive strategies, has already slowed Russian progress. With the new policy, officials hope to halt the offensive entirely, giving Ukraine a stronger position to repel Russian forces and protect its sovereignty.\n\nThe US decision to allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons for strikes within Russian territory marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing conflict. By providing Ukraine with the means to more effectively counter Russian offensives, the US and its allies aim to bolster Ukraine's defense and deter further Russian aggression. As the war continues to evolve, this policy shift underscores the international community's commitment to supporting Ukraine in its struggle for sovereignty and territorial integrity.", "source":

Ukrainian authorities have not sought permission for strikes beyond this region.\n\nThe official confirmed that Kyiv made the request for this policy change in response to the advancing Russian forces in recent weeks. Ukrainian forces are now empowered to target Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nNevertheless, the Biden administration has maintained its stance against allowing Ukraine to utilize its most formidable munitions, including the long-range ATACMS missiles, which have a range of up to 200 miles (300 kilometers), as reported by CNN.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken hinted at the possibility of adjusting the administration's approach earlier this week. \"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed,\" Blinken remarked during a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe shift in policy aligns with recent statements from European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Macron emphasised the need for Ukraine to neutralise military sites within Russia that pose a threat to Ukrainian territory. \"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron stated.\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.\"\n\nScholz echoed Macron's sentiments, affirming that Ukraine has the right to defend itself within the parameters set by the countries supplying the weapons and international law, CNN reported.\n\nMilestone Alert!

This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to reconsider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves.\"\n\nThe Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky agreed saying Ukraine is in desperate need of resources to counter Russia's relentless threats.\n\nNorway say they believe that under international law Ukraine can and should attack Russia.\n\nWith foreign minister Espen Barth Eide even saying Norway would allow them to hit parts of Russia as part of their self defence.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city Kharkiv is now seeing intense fighting as Putin's troops look to push forward into the northeast.\n\nKharkiv's mayor Ihor Terekhov has begged the West to step in and accused Vlad of terrorising its 1.3 million residents and plunging the city into darkness.\n\nRussian attacks on Kharkiv - liberated after six months of Moscow's occupation in September 2022 - have been scaling up dramatically in previous weeks, killing dozens and leaving thousands without electricity.\n\nTerekhov said that unless the West steps up and delivers crucial air defence systems - Kharkiv could suffer the same fate as the Syrian city of Aleppo, which heavy Russian bombing helped to decimate a decade ago.\n\nLast Saturday, at least 18 people were killed after a Russian missile strike hit a retail park in the region sparking a horror inferno.\n\nDramatic footage shows massive plumes of black smoke rising into the Kharkiv sky after the Epicentre construction hypermarket became engulfed by

The Post claimed the officials were \"actively weighing\" whether to stop discouraging Ukraine from using American weapons to strike Russian targets. Biden has led efforts to provide Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons in response to the Russian invasion since 2022 but has yet to publicly support Ukrainian attacks inside Russia out of concern that doing so will prompt Russian strongman Vladimir Putin to retaliate directly against the United States or other NATO powers.\n\nRussia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, colonizing its Crimean peninsula in an \"annexation\" that Kyiv has rejected for a decade. The war simmered for years in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, fueled by Russia-backed separatists seeking to sever ties with the Ukrainian government. Following Biden's decision to lift sanctions on the now-defunct Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, Putin dramatically escalated the conflict by formally invading Ukraine using the Russian military in February 2022. Since then, Putin has \"annexed\" four more regions of the country -- the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- and made small but incremental gains in securing a growing amount of Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe lack of significant progress for Ukraine in thwarting the invasion in recent months appears to have prompted growing anxiety in the West and mounting calls to stop discouraging Ukraine from attacking Russian territory. Blinken was asked about Biden's restrictions on U.S. weapons in the context of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg suggesting that Ukraine should be allowed to attack Russia.\n\n\"To deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\" Stoltenberg reportedly said.\n\nAsked if Biden would reconsider limits on how American weapons could be used in Ukraine, Blinken responded that the White House would \"adapt\" to the status of the war accordingly.\n\n\"We haven't encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine, but Ukraine, as I've said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself,\" Blinken said, adding that America would \"adapt and adjust\" policies if needed.\n\nAsked to clarify if that meant that Biden could, at some point, approve of Ukrainian strikes in Russian territory, Blinken replied, \"With regard to Ukraine, adapt and adjust means exactly that.\"\n\n\"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary, and so that's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" he elaborated. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself.\"\n\nThe implication of Blinken's comments appeared to contrast with comments made a day before by White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby, who insisted there was \"no change at this point, we don't encourage or enable the use of U.S. supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.\"\n\nUkraine is already using its own weapons to hit Russian targets, the Washington Post noted on Thursday. Following Stoltenberg's comments, several European nations also appeared to give approval to Ukraine to attack Russian territory.\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralize military sites where missiles are fired, from where ... Ukraine is attacked,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said, with a caveat that he did not approve of striking Russian civilian communities.\n\nPolish Defense Minister Cezary Tomczyk more broadly said in an interview that Ukraine \"can fight as they want,\" without restrictions, using Polish weapons.\n\n\"We decided to help Ukraine in the conflict, Ukraine was brutally attacked, so it has the right to defend itself as it deems appropriate,\" Tomczyk reportedly said.\n\nDenmark and Finland soon followed. Asked about Ukraine using Danish weapons to attack Russia, Foreign Affairs Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said, \"The short answer is yes.\"\n\n\"When we discussed this with our Foreign Affairs Committee in the Danish Parliament, we made it very clear from the beginning - that this is part of self-defense, which will likely also imply the attacks on military facilities on Russian soil,\" Rasmussen added, according to the Ukrainian state outlet Ukrinform.\n\nFinnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen similarly stated that Finland had not specified to Kyiv any restrictions on how Ukraine could use Finnish weapons.\n\nStoltenberg appeared to defend his statements, promising to advocate for supporting Ukraine at July's NATO summit.\n\n\"Ukraine can still prevail - but only with continued, robust support from NATO Allies. So at the NATO Summit in July, we plan to put our support on a firmer footing,\" Stoltenberg said on Thursday, \"Including with a greater NATO role in coordinating security assistance and training, as well as a multi-year financial commitment.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances

Kyiv Use Western Weapons to Hit Targets in Russia", "body": "Russia's leader warns they 'should be aware of what they are playing with.'\n\nSeveral European leaders this week signaled their willingness to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike targets inside Russian territory.\n\n\"We should allow them to neutralize military sites [inside Russia] from which missiles are fired,\" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on May 28.\n\nHe made the comment at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also agreed that Ukraine should be \"allowed to defend itself\" from cross-border Russian attacks.\n\nOn the same day, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced similar sentiments, stressing Kyiv's \"right to self-defense.\"\n\n\"This right ... also includes striking targets outside Ukraine -- legitimate military targets inside Russia,\" he said before meeting EU defense ministers in Brussels.\n\nAccording to Mr. Stoltenberg, the issue is \"particularly relevant\" now, given a recent string of Russian military gains in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nSince Moscow launched its invasion in early 2022, Ukraine's allies have prohibited Kyiv from using Western weapons to strike targets inside Russia, fearing such a move could dramatically broaden the conflict.\n\nBut as Russian forces continue to capture territory -- in Kharkiv and elsewhere -- most Western capitals now appear to be changing their tune.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Cameron started the trend early this month when he upheld Ukraine's \"right\" to use British long-range missiles to hit targets inside Russian territory.\n\n\"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" he said during a visit to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow responded by vowing to strike British military assets -- in Ukraine and elsewhere -- if UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were used against Russian territory.\n\nYet despite the Russian warnings, several of Kyiv's most ardent supporters -- led by the three Baltic States -- have since repeated Mr. Cameron's assertions.\n\n\"The way to react to Russian aggression ... is to allow Ukraine to use the weapons they have in the way they need to use them,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's foreign minister, said on May 27.\n\nIn televised comments the same day, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics claimed there was \"no rational reason not to let Ukraine use these [Western-supplied] weapons against Russia.\"\n\nIn a social-media post, Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's defense minister, called on Kyiv's allies to \"allow Ukraine to strike military targets\" deep inside Russian territory.\n\nThe Danish and Czech prime ministers, along with the Dutch Defense Ministry, issued similar statements this week.\n\nItaly, meanwhile, has remained an exception, insisting that any weapons it gives to Ukraine must only be used inside the latter's borders.\n\n\"All weapons sent from Italy [to Kyiv] should only be used within Ukraine,\" Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said in televised comments on May 30.\n\nOn May 29, White House national security spokesman John Kirby appeared adamant that Washington had not changed its stance on the issue.\n\n\"Right now, there's no change to our policy,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We do not encourage, nor do we enable, attacks using U.S. weapons on Russian soil,\" he said.\n\n\"But our support to Ukraine has evolved appropriately as the battlefield conditions have evolved,\" he added. \"And that's not going to change.\"\n\nOn the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington could \"adjust\" its stance on the issue in light of current realities.\n\n\"As the nature of the battlefield has changed, as the locations, the means that Russia is employing have changed, we've adapted and adjusted to that,\" he said.\n\n\"That's exactly what we'll do going forward,\" Mr. Blinken added.\n\nMoscow's response to the issue, meanwhile, has been more forthright.\n\nWhen asked about the shift in position among Kyiv's European allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned: \"Constant escalation can lead to serious consequences.\"\n\n\"If these serious consequences occur in Europe, how will the United States behave, bearing in mind our parity in the field of strategic weapons?\" he said on May 28.\n\nHe added that Kyiv's use of long-range weapons -- to hit targets in Russia -- would require the help of Western powers, making them direct parties to the conflict.\n\nKyiv's European allies, the Russian leader warned, \"should be aware of what they are playing with.\"\n\nHe went on to note the small size of most countries in Europe, many of which contain \"densely populated\" urban areas.\n\n\"This is something they should bear in mind before they talk about strikes inside Russian territory,\" Mr. Putin asserted.",

The permission from Biden is intended solely for Ukraine to attack military sites in Russia being used for the Kharkiv offensive, US officials said.\n\n\"Russian commanders are well aware of Ukraine's inability to strike back,\" Peter Dickinson, a Ukraine analyst at the Atlantic Council in Washington, wrote in an analysis published before Biden's policy change.\n\nOfficials and experts say that launching missiles into Russia, striking its troops, bases, airfields, and supply lines, could pay immediate dividends. Indeed, the Ukrainian military already appears to be preparing to launch some initial strikes, \"to test out the Russian response,\" Rafael Loss, a weapons specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nBut Ukraine and the NATO allies have been reluctant to shoulder the risk of changing tactics without US approval, Loss said. \"The United States ultimately would carry a lot of the burden of responding if there was a significant escalation by Russia, for example, against NATO territory.\"\n\nEvery country giving weapons to Ukraine has the right to prescribe how they are used, and so far Britain, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Poland have stated their support for Ukraine hitting military targets on Russian soil.\n\nSome nations are more cautious than others. Germany and Sweden, for example, conditioned their approval solely \"within the framework of international law,\" as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz put it Tuesday. He was spelling out a requirement that other countries have also maintained over the last two years of arming Ukraine, even if not voiced as prominently.\n\nBritain was one of the first to argue for loosening the restraints. \"Ukraine has that right,\" Foreign Minister David Cameron said during a May 3 visit to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself.\"\n\nThe movement picked up steam when vigorous support by French President Emmanuel Macron helped persuade a more reluctant Germany to reconsider its position this week. \"It's as if we were telling them: 'We're giving you arms but you cannot use them to defend yourself',\" Macron said in Berlin this week, with Scholz by his side.\n\nSeveral countries -- Belgium, Italy, and until now, the United States -- had said they were not ready to let Ukraine use their weapons to hit targets inside Russia, citing the risks, which can be hard to anticipate. For example, recent Ukrainian attacks with its own drones on Russia's nuclear early-warning radar systems, a potentially destabilizing step, have raised deep concerns in Washington.\n\nOn Monday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said NATO allies \"must be very prudent\" before Western weapons are used in Russian territory. A day later, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announced the donation of 30 F-16 jets to Ukraine -- but only \"for utilization by the Ukraine Defense Forces on Ukraine territory.\"\n\nIn Washington, a White House spokesperson maintained Tuesday that the Biden administration would not \"encourage or enable\" the use of American weapons on Russian soil. But that resistance softened in the face of mounting pressure from its allies, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested the next day that the United States might \"adapt and adjust\" its stance based on battlefield conditions.\n\nWith permission already granted, Ukraine can strike into Russia with Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain and closely related SCALP missiles from France. The missiles have a range of about 150 miles and are fired from Ukraine's aging fleet of Soviet-designed fighter jets.\n\nSeveral countries -- Britain, Germany, Norway, and the United States -- have given Ukraine ground-based launchers that can fire longer-range missiles. Those systems are known as HIMARS and MLRS launchers, and they can also shoot the United States' ATACMS, missiles that have a range of up to 190 miles.\n\n\"If they green-light the use of ATACMS, that could degrade Russia's ability to use its territory as a sanctuary for ground operations,\" Loss said.\n\nBut the new authorizations may have their greatest impact in the war for air superiority -- especially if the allies allow their donated jets and drones to attack within Russia's air space.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors":

All services are working at the scene,\" said Oleg Synyegubov, Head of Kharkiv Region Military Administration.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been \"a single military person, not a single military object\" present.\n\nThe city is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in Kharkiv last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russia's military said on Friday that it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe Temryuk strike sparked a fire, which raged for several hours before being extinguished, and wounded several oil depot workers, Krasnodar Region Governor Venyamin Kondratyev wrote on the Telegram social media channel.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Novorossiisk strike, local authorities said.\n\n- Restrictions lifted -\n\nA US official said Biden \"had recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons or counter-fire\n\npurposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them.\"\n\nThe official said that ATACMS missiles, which could hit deeper inside Russia, were still prohibited.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy, which followed weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions between the White House and top US military and State Department officials.\n\nBiden gave the final sign-off in recent days, but the decision was kept secret for operational reasons and only became effective on Thursday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday.\n\nbur-juf/smw/cwl/gv/db\n\nMore from this section\n\nACES Quality Management Partners with Digilytics, Provider of AI-Powered Document Indexing, Categorization for QC Reviews\n\nYouth for Human Rights Petitions the Ontario Legislative Assembly To Require Human Rights Education Throughout the Province\n\nFliFlik Free Giveaway Event!

This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to reconsider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves.\"\n\nThe Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky agreed saying Ukraine is in desperate need of resources to counter Russia's relentless threats.\n\nNorway say they believe that under international law Ukraine can and should attack Russia.\n\nWith foreign minister Espen Barth Eide even saying Norway would allow them to hit parts of Russia as part of their self defence.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city Kharkiv is now seeing intense fighting as Putin's troops look to push forward into the northeast.\n\nKharkiv's mayor Ihor Terekhov has begged the West to step in and accused Vlad of terrorising its 1.3 million residents and plunging the city into darkness.\n\nRussian attacks on Kharkiv - liberated after six months of Moscow's occupation in September 2022 - have been scaling up dramatically in previous weeks, killing dozens and leaving thousands without electricity.\n\nTerekhov said that unless the West steps up and delivers crucial air defence systems - Kharkiv could suffer the same fate as the Syrian city of Aleppo, which heavy Russian bombing helped to decimate a decade ago.\n\nLast Saturday, at least 18 people were killed after a Russian missile strike hit a retail park in the region sparking a horror inferno.\n\nDramatic footage shows massive plumes of black smoke rising into the Kharkiv sky after the Epicentre construction hypermarket became engulfed by flames.\n\nWitnesses told our Sun reporter on the scene there were 200 people inside the 10,000sqft construction hypermarket.\n\nHero Brit volunteer Tony Ferret, 34, of Rye, Kent, was among those trying to help as the sky filled with black smoke.\n\nHe told The Sun: \"They were trying to move vehicles out of the way so they could get the fire engines in.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine claimed Putin's Russia reached a grim milestone after losing more than 500,000 soldiers in their failing war.\n\nKyiv said Moscow's crumbling army has also lost some 22,000 tanks and armoured vehicles and nearly 700 aircraft since the invasion.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgie_english@the-sun.com", "name": "Georgie English", "type":

It neither encouraged nor implemented Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil.\n\nPressure on the United States to ease sanctions on Ukraine striking inside Russia has increased in recent days, with French President Emmanuel Macron expressing direct support for the move. He said Ukraine should be \"allowed\" to use Western-supplied weapons against military bases on Russian territory -- though not necessarily on civilian targets.\n\nThat pressure has been heightened by Russia's recent advances on the battlefield. Moscow has made significant gains in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and northeastern Kharkiv region. Ukraine's losses were exacerbated by a partisan deadlock in Washington that caused long delays in the delivery of missiles and artillery shells.\n\nMr Macron has for some time advocated for direct intervention in the Ukraine war - an idea that other Western leaders also seem to be softening.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was cautious in public but a spokesman in Berlin said, \"Defensive action is not confined to one's own territory, but also includes the territory of the aggressor.\"\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said earlier this month that Ukraine should decide how to use British weapons, and this week Poland's deputy defense minister said Ukrainians could use Polish weapons \"as they see fit\".\n\nDebate over the issue is ongoing within the US administration, with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken believed to be among those trying to convince President Biden to ease restrictions.\n\nMr Blinken became the first senior administration official to suggest the US might change its position during a visit to Moldova on Wednesday, telling reporters that Washington's position on the matter would \"adapt and adjust\" based on changing battlefield conditions.\n\n\"[Ukraine] It must make its own decisions about the best way to defend itself effectively. We are going to ensure the necessary equipment for that,\" he said.\n\n\"What has changed in terms of how Russia continues its aggression and expansion, we have adapted and adjusted, and I believe we will continue to do so,\" Mr Blinken added.\n\nBut there are significant risks to any decision by Mr Biden to loosen restrictions on Ukraine's use of US-supplied weapons.\n\nUkrainian drone strikes have already reportedly targeted Russian nuclear early warning radar systems within the country's borders.\n\nUS administration, According to the Washington PostKiev expressed its concerns over two attempted attacks against radar stations that provide conventional air defense and warnings from Western countries about nuclear missiles.\n\nThe report cited an unnamed U.S. official as describing these as key locations because \"Russia could perceive its strategic deterrent capabilities being targeted, which would undermine Russia's ability to maintain a nuclear deterrent against the United States.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned this week that Ukraine's attacks on Russia by Western missiles risked igniting a wider war. \"Continued escalation will lead to serious consequences,\" he said. \"Do they want a global conflict?\"\n\nHe also said that while Ukraine's forces had carried out the attacks, responsibility for any attacks inside his country's territory rested with Western arms suppliers.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said it is \"unfair\" for Western countries to impose limits on the use of their weapons, while admitting that Ukraine cannot risk the support of its partners.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Blinken met President Zelensky in Kiev. Mr Zelenskiy raised \"security guarantees\" that include a long-term bilateral security agreement between the US and Ukraine that is close to being signed.\n\nAny question about whether Washington would allow Ukraine to use American weapons to launch an incursion into Russian territory would have come up in their private talks.\n\nSome NATO countries are nervous about that prospect. On Thursday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she did not think it was necessary to attack Russian military bases and instead urged the West to provide more air defenses to Ukraine.\n\nThe US has already delivered thousands of self-defense weapons, tanks and air defense systems to Ukraine. Since April, it has also sent a longer-range version of the ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, which can travel up to 190 miles (300 km).", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

This comes as the Russian forces have taken area in Kharkiv in recent weeks.\n\nA US official familiar with the matters told Politico, \"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them.\" The official added that the policy on allowing long-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken previously suggested the possibility in a joint meeting with Moldovan President Maia Sandu where reporters were able to be present. Blinken prefaced the suggestion, saying, \"We haven't encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"But Ukraine, as I've said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself. We're going to make sure that it has the equipment it needs to do that,\" he added in response to the question on the possibility of the US allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with US weaponry.\n\nBlinken chose his words carefully, not explicitly supporting or defending an action of Ukraine hitting targets in the interior of Russia. \"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over these, now, more than two years has been to adapt as conditions have changed and the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression and escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that.\" he said.\n\nRussian's foreign ministry has warned that if Ukraine was obtaining longer-range missiles from the US in order to strike Russian soil, the Kremlin would see the US as a \"direct party to the conflict,\" according to the Daily Mail. The US is Ukraine's most important supplier of weaponry and passed a $61 billion aid package for the country in April. According to recent polls, a majority of Americans have said they think that the US is spending too much on foreign aid, with 57 percent of likely US voters. Only 23 percent said that the amount spent is about right in April.", "source": {"uri": "fromthetrenchesworldreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "From the Trenches World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maia_Sandu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maia Sandu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Moldova", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Moldova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://mr.cdn.ignitecdn.com/client_assets/thepostmillennial_com/media/picture/6658/d242/386d/e60b/8a2b/3aa5/original_biden_ukainre.png?1717097025", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

restrictions haven't fully been lifted and only apply to forces defending the Kharkiv area, according to reports.\n\nLast month, Congress approved more than $60billion (\u00a347billion) in military

It has (...) been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorized Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Of course it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\n\"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\n(Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet;

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nTalks about changing the policy intensified inside the Biden administration more than two weeks ago, after Russia stepped up its offensive around Kharkiv, according to one of the officials familiar with the White House deliberations.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a secure video conference with their Ukrainian counterparts in which the Ukrainian side pressed for permission to use U.S. weaponry to hit Russian positions across the border that were being used to attack the Kharkiv region, according to a U.S. official familiar with the White House deliberation.\n\nFollowing that May 13 meeting with the Ukrainians, Sullivan, Austin and Brown huddled and agree to make a recommendation to Biden to alter the policy.\n\nSullivan presented the recommendation to Biden two days later, making the case that it was common-sense for the Ukrainians to be able to strike back to counter the attacks on their land that were originating from Russian territory. Biden agreed.\n\nLater on May 15, Biden had a follow-up conversation with Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who leads U.S. European command, Austin and Sullivan and asked them to move forward on finalizing the details to the change in policy.\n\nMeanwhile, during Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the top U.S. diplomat's thinking.\n\nBlinken met with Biden and Sullivan on May 17, following his visit to Kyiv, and shared what he heard from Zelenskyy and made clear that he also supported giving the Ukrainians more leeway to strike back on Russia.\n\nCautious\n\nStill, Biden remained cautious and asked for due diligence before giving final approval.\n\nSullivan convened the administration's national security leaders for a conversation the following week, and they all agreed to move forward. Sullivan received final approval from Biden several days ago, but the guidance did not go into effect until Thursday, the official said.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision to make. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined North Atlantic Treaty Organization's foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed. / AP", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_G._Cavoli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher G.

At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nThe tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon, and Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nA Russian onslaught this month in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including a Russian aerial bomb attack on a large construction supplies store that killed 18 people on May 25, has forced the evacuation of thousands of people and has stretched Ukraine's depleted forces.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials,\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in US military aid.

Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative on some parts of the 600-mile front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its

Kartapolov stated that Joe Biden's decision will not affect Russian military operations.\n\nIt is recalled that yesterday's publication by Politico, citing three U.S. officials and two well-informed sources it did not name, reported that U.S. President Joe Biden quietly allowed Ukraine to use American weapon systems in attacks against Russian border areas, exclusively near the Kharkiv region.\n\nSee Also:\n\nPM Mitsotakis from Paiania: \"We will not return to the era of memorandums - That's where the proposals of SYRIZA lead us\"\n\n\"The president recently instructed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use American weapons for the purpose of counterattacking in Kharkiv, so that Ukraine can respond to Russian forces that are striking it or preparing to strike it,\" one of the U.S. officials stated. However, he emphasized that the U.S. policy \"has not changed,\" under which Kiev is not allowed to use long-range missiles for strikes within Russia.\n\nAs Politico notes, Ukraine requested the U.S. to change their policy after the start of the Russian attack on Kharkiv this month, the official clarified.\n\nEssentially, Ukraine can now use weapons provided by the U.S., such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down Russian missiles aimed at Kiev, against troops gathering on the Russian side of the borders near Kharkiv, or against Russian bombers launching bombs against Ukrainian territory.\n\nHowever, the official stressed that Ukraine cannot use these weapons to strike non-military infrastructure or to launch long-range missiles against military targets deep inside Russian

Russia with US arms to defend Kharkiv, say officials", "body": "WASHINGTON, May 31 -- President Joe Biden has lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the under-fire Kharkiv region, US officials said yesterday.\n\nBiden has come under increasing pressure from a desperate Ukraine to ease his ban, but had so far resisted amid fears it could drag Nato into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the official said, referring to long-range missiles recently sent by Washington to Kyiv.\n\nA second US official confirmed Biden's change of policy.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Kyiv's supporters -- chiefly the United States -- to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets on Russian soil.\n\nSome countries including Britain and the Netherlands say Kyiv has the right to use their weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed,\" as he spoke to reporters on a visit to Moldova on the eve of Nato talks in Prague.\n\nBlinken, who travelled Kyiv earlier this month to see the increasingly grave situation as Russia pushes forward towards Kharkiv, had been widely reported to be pressing Biden to ease the rules.\n\nAhead of the Nato meeting, which starts with a dinner on Thursday, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits because they hampered Kyiv's ability to defend itself.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralize\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nPressure has also been mounting ahead of a series of key meetings in Europe in coming weeks where Kyiv's plight will be in focus.\n\nBiden will attend ceremonies in France marking the World War Two D-Day landings in early June where Ukraine's Zelensky will also be present.\n\nThe US president will also meet leaders of the world's top economies at the G7 summit in Italy. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThat restriction has frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military is unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri":

Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThat restriction has frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military is unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border - Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia - or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.

Ukrainian forces have suffered setbacks in the country's northeastern region, apparently prompting the policy reversal, but some Ukraine skeptics have cautioned that allowing strikes inside Russia with U.S. weapons could invite unwelcome and serious escalation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" one U.S. official told Politico. The official added that the administration's policy of not permitting long-range strikes inside Russia's borders \"has not changed.\" (RELATED: White House Reportedly Worried About Russia's Sudden Momentum Months After Biden Declared Putin 'Already Lost' War)\n\nUkrainian forces can now use U.S. weaponry to counter Russian missiles bound for Kharkiv, fire upon soldiers assembling inside Russia to attack nearby Kharkiv, or take down Russian bombers attacking Ukraine, according to Politico. However, the new stance will reportedly not allow Ukraine to use that firepower to target civilian infrastructure or launch long-range attacks against military installations further in the Russian interior.\n\nThe Biden administration had previously asserted that allowing Ukrainian strikes inside Russia with U.S.-provided weaponry could prompt Putin to escalate or broaden the conflict, according to Politico. However, the deteriorating situation around Kharkiv reportedly forced the administration to change its mind, especially as Ukrainian officials have emphasized their need to disrupt the buildup of troops pouring into the northeast from just over the border.\n\nOther U.S. allies that have contributed to Ukraine's war effort, including France and the U.K., have previously argued that the Ukrainians should be able to use weapons provided by the West to strike inside Russia's borders, according to Politico. Russia has cautioned that NATO risks escalation if the alliance permits Ukraine to use provided weapons to attack inside Russia, with Putin warning that allowing such attacks could \"lead to serious consequences.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) declined to comment, and referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to the National Security Council (NSC).

He added: 'We should not allow them to touch other targets in Russia, and obviously civilian capacities.' The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he agreed with the French president, as long as the Ukrainians respected the conditions of the weapons' suppliers.\n\nThis week the Spanish daily, El Pa\u00eds, warned as Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, arrived in Madrid this week to secure major arm supplies from Spain, that:\n\nUkraine is focusing its diplomatic efforts on convincing its allies to allow its military to use NATO weaponry against targets on Russian soil. Kyiv has succeeded in the past in moving the red lines imposed on it by its partners in the West, after months of negotiations. The new Russian offensive on Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, has accelerated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's diplomatic drive to allay the fears of the United States and Europe of a possible escalation if weapons provided by them target Russian sovereign territory.\n\nLast week, Charles Q. Brown, chair of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that the White House had received a formal request from Kyiv to use U.S. weapons against Russian territory. NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has urged NATO states to reconsider limits on sending certain weapons to Ukraine, weapons which could strike Moscow and other Russian cities. This is despite Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warning that Moscow will retaliate with strikes on British targets if British weapons are used by Ukraine to strike Russian territory, as suggested by Cameron.\n\nZakharova told reporters that British targets 'on Ukraine's territory and beyond its borders' could be hit in such a scenario. She was repeating a warning that Moscow first issued earlier this month after British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine had a right to use weapons provided by London to hit targets inside Russia. Otherwise, British, or indeed U.S. and French, missiles could only be fired by British, American or French personnel using intelligence gathered by NATO (in reality by the U.S.).\n\nHow would Sunak or Starmer react to Russian strikes on British targets? It is hard not to see them running to Washington for help in retaliating and in demanding other NATO countries rally round a NATO member under attack, as they are bound to do. This could well happen within the early stages of a Starmer premiership when he would be gung-ho to demonstrate how tough he was on the supposed Russian threat.\n\nStoltenberg called on those continuing to limit their arms supplies to reconsider their position, citing the 'nature of the fighting taking place in Kharkiv'.\n\nBy having too many restrictions we are tying one hand of the Ukrainian armed forces on their back because they are reducing their capability to defend themselves.\n\nThe U.S., UK and France have already supplied such weapons -- U.S HIMARS short-range missiles and ATACMS long-range missiles, and British-French Storm Shadow/Scalp long-range missiles -- to Ukraine, but insist they should not be fired, claiming they are there simply as a deterrent. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has ruled out sending Taurus missiles, despite repeated requests by Kyiv. Scholz has previously claimed the missile would need to be operated by German teams on the ground in Ukraine, something he refuses to countenance.\n\nThere is too a growing clamour that NATO forces should be deployed inside Ukraine to counter a mounting Russian advance in the north of that country, threatening its second city, Kharkiv as well as attacking in the east and south. French President, Emmanuel Macron, said earlier this month that he'd consider sending French troops to Ukraine 'if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request, which is not the case today.'\n\nThe mind boggles at how this would play out if it were to occur. A de facto war between France and Russia would, most likely, escalate very quickly. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has already pointed to the use of nuclear weapons if there was such an escalation.\n\nThat did not bother NATO politicians gathered at something called the Lennart Meri Conference in Estonia last week. While there, Benjamin Haddad, a member of parliament for Macron's Renaissance party and considered a leading voice in French foreign-policy discussions, told the American magazine Newsweek that NATO and the European Union need to 'turn the tables' on Russian President Vladimir Putin after more than two years of full-scale war. He claimed that the French-led push for deeper NATO involvement inside Ukrainian borders is making headway with European allies.\n\nHaddad argued: 'Right now, a lot of Ukrainian troops are stationed at the border with Belarus to prevent a potential invasion from the north. Western forces could be deployed along the frontier as a \"tripwire\"-as you have troops in the Baltic states or in Poland-to be able to liberate some of these Ukrainian troops to go to the front.' Belarus is a close ally of Russia. Putting NATO troops on its border would be completely unacceptable to it. Once there, potential clashes on the border could get out of hand very quickly.\n\nDer Spiegel reported that MPs from the three Baltic states warned German officials at the same conference that their governments, together with Poland, were poised to send troops to Ukraine if Russia captured significant territory in eastern Ukraine, even before Russian soldiers were anywhere near their borders. The same MPs raised concerns about German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's current policy toward the war. In particular Scholz's refusal to allow Ukraine Taurus missiles, to be used in strikes on Russian soil.\n\nMeanwhile, faced with a major shortfall in troop numbers compared to the Russians, Ukrainian officials have asked their U.S. and NATO counterparts to help train 150,000 new recruits closer to the front line for faster deployment. The Lithuanian defence minister, Kaja Kallas, wants exactly that. She told the Financial Times that:\n\n\"There are countries who are training soldiers on the ground already\" and they did so at their own risk. If training personnel were attacked by Russian forces, it would not automatically trigger NATO's Article 5 mutual defence clause, she said. I can't possibly imagine that if somebody is hurt there, then those who have sent their people will say 'it's Article 5. Let's... bomb Russia.' It is not how it works. It's not automatic. So these fears are not well-founded.\" If you send your people to help Ukrainians... you know the country is in war and you go to a risk zone. So you take the risk,\" she added.\n\nIn response to this, General Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, suggested last week that the Europeans would 'get there eventually, over time', on sending more troops to Ukraine. Yet, how would the United States respond if their troops were killed in Ukraine by the Russians while acting as trainers? Do Kallas and Brown not know that the U.S. ground presence in Vietnam began with it being claimed by the John F. Kennedy administration that they were there simply to train troops of its puppet South Vietnam? Ground troops followed to 'protect' those same trainers.\n\nThe El Pa\u00eds article quoted earlier also pointed out that Ukraine has successfully pressurised the U.S. and NATO to scrap so-called red lines limiting the arms they provide Kyiv. The United States agreed in April, after two years of negotiations, to supply Ukraine with long-range ATACMS missiles, another supposed red line. Other limits breached involved Germany and the U.S. supplying heavy armour, and the scrapping of the refusal during the first year and a half of the war to deliver fighter planes. This summer, the first six F-16 fighters for the Ukrainian Air Force are expected to arrive from Denmark.\n\nThe newspaper points out that, 'Biden resisted the delivery of F-16s due to concerns they would be used for bombing targets within Russian borders.' Ukraine regularly hits military, industrial, and energy infrastructure targets inside Russia, even up to 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the border, particularly targeting Russia's oil industry.\n\nWashington has called on Zelenskiy to halt this campaign, because it could destabilise the global fuel market, but the warnings, voiced in public even by Biden's Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have not stopped these attacks. When U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, visited Kyiv earlier this month, he stated: 'We have not encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine, but ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it's going to conduct this war, a war it's conducting in defense of its freedom, of its sovereignty, of its territorial integrity. And we will continue to back Ukraine with the equipment that it needs to succeed, that it needs to win.' These are weasel words, similar to the ones he regularly spouts over Gaza, sometimes to the accompaniment of crocodile tears.\n\nThe Biden administration cannot allow Ukraine to collapse prior to November's Presidential election. If escalation was needed to stave off defeat, the red line on missile strikes on Russia could be quickly erased.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine was criminal, and it unleashed a brutal war of attrition like 1914-1918 on a smaller scale. Yet, reference to 1914 should allow us to grasp how things can escalate very badly when you have two military alliances peering over the barrel of a gun at each other.\n\nAs Britain goes to the polls, we should be demanding of Sunak and Starmer a de-escalation of our military involvement in Ukraine, where we do not just have missiles, but in all probability special forces. However, the likelihood is that both will compete to show who is the stronger Atlanticist and the greater zealot in seeing off the supposed Russian threat.", "source": {"uri": "mronline.org",

It has (...) been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorized Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Of course it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\n\"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\n(Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet; Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten and Gareth Jones)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Ukrainian authorities have not sought permission for strikes beyond this region.\n\nThe request for this policy change was made by Kyiv in response to the advancing Russian forces in recent weeks, the official confirmed. Ukrainian forces are now empowered to target Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia.\n\nNevertheless, the Biden administration has maintained its stance against allowing Ukraine to utilize its most formidable munitions, including the long-range ATACMS missiles, which have a range of up to 200 miles (300 kilometers), as reported by CNN.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken hinted at the possibility of adjusting the administration's approach earlier this week. \"Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed,\" Blinken remarked during a visit to Moldova. \"I am confident we will continue to do that.\"\n\nThe shift in policy aligns with recent statements from European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Macron emphasised the need for Ukraine to neutralise military sites within Russia that pose a threat to Ukrainian territory. \"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\" Macron stated.\n\n\"We think that we should allow them to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.\"\n\nScholz echoed Macron's sentiments, affirming that Ukraine has the right to defend itself within the parameters set by the countries supplying the weapons and international law, CNN reported.

It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorized Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE\n\nRussian jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nIn Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical borders on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ... Ukraine has the right to defend itself according to the rules of humanitarian law.\" (Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet in Prague, Alan Charlish in Warsaw and Enrico Sciacovelli

the policy change would be to allow Ukrainian US-supplied artillery to fire back at Russian batteries over the Russian border from Kharkiv region, which have had a withering effect on Ukrainian

President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top officials in his government have campaigned for the shift with increasing urgency as Russia has pressed its assault there, emboldened by the Kremlin's knowledge of Washington's red lines, officials in Kyiv say.\n\nThe decision draws Biden even deeper into a war in which Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly raised the prospect of a nuclear strike, a concern for a U.S. leader who matured amid the U.S.-Soviet nuclear confrontations of the 1960s. Biden has been cautious about escalation - but also mindful that the Ukrainians have repeatedly been granted greater capabilities and faced down a Kremlin that did little in response.\n\nA growing number of the United States' European allies in recent days also had urged the administration to lift its opposition, signaling an intent to allow their own weapons to be used against military targets on Russian soil. Although Ukraine has used some European arms as well as their own to fight back, Washington's say-so has been the most important because of the quantity and the quality of its equipment.\n\nThe shift allows Ukraine to use U.S.-provided artillery and rocket launchers to hit Russian troops and equipment just across the border from Kharkiv and to strike missiles headed toward Ukrainian territory, U.S. officials said. They emphasized that the Biden administration's policy barring longer-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\n\"This is in response to the Ukrainian request, which was to be able to respond to attacks that are emanating from that area\" in Russia's Belgorod region, \"to be able to hit Russian forces and arms depots,\" one U.S. official said, adding that \"Ukraine is not asking for a blanket policy change, and we're not changing that policy.\"\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Speaking earlier Thursday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesman, chastised the United States and its NATO allies, saying the alliance was responsible for setting off \"a new round of escalating tension.\"\n\n\"They are doing this deliberately,\" Peskov said. \"We are hearing a lot of belligerent statements.\"\n\nBiden's reassessment, first reported by Politico, was several weeks in the making. It is a byproduct, officials said, of Russia's renewed cross-border assault on Kharkiv, the mounting pressure from across Europe and a visit to Kyiv this month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that reinforced the peril facing Ukraine after more than two years of war.\n\nUkraine had been holding off Russian forces with increasing difficulty in recent months as U.S. military aid all but dried up last fall after congressional Republicans came out in opposition to further aid. Kyiv faced dwindling stocks of ammunition and antiaircraft missiles - to the point where diplomats posted in the Ukrainian capital started to worry this spring about a sudden collapse on the front lines and a major Ukrainian defeat.\n\nThat changed after Congress approved aid last month. But Ukrainian morale remains low, and shortages of trained soldiers mean that the front lines are still vulnerable despite the resumption of U.S. military assistance. Russia, meanwhile, has taken advantage of the moment, driving against Kharkiv and throughout other parts of the long front line as it tries to exploit the window before more U.S. aid helps stabilize Kyiv's troops.\n\nUkrainian officials first asked the White House for permission weeks ago, on May 13, days after the assault on Kharkiv began and the day before Blinken arrived in Kyiv, another U.S. official said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. agreed to recommend a policy shift to Biden, the official said.\n\nSullivan took the recommendation to the president two days later, as Blinken was departing Kyiv, and Biden agreed to it that same day, May 15, this official said. Blinken, meeting Biden later that week after his Ukraine trip, agreed that the shift made sense, the official said, adding that Biden asked for top officials to work through the details and the risks before a final approval.\n\nBiden signed off on the change several days ago, and the policy went info effect Thursday.\n\nBlinken, during a visit to Moldova this week, became the first senior Biden administration official to publicly indicate that Washington was considering the policy shift, telling reporters that \"as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too.\"\n\nBlinken emerged from his trip to Kyiv this month convinced that some form of limited policy shift was necessary, officials said. At a closed-door meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague on Thursday, the top U.S. diplomat hinted at an impending policy shift but did not provide details, one participant said. When he was asked directly about it at one point, he smiled but stayed silent, the person said.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a recent interview with the Economist that the time had come for allies to rethink their restrictions. \"Especially now when a lot of the fighting is going on in Kharkiv, close to the border, to deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves.\"\n\nIn the days since, allies including France, the Netherlands, Canada and Finland echoed the sentiment.\n\nIn a visit to Kyiv this month, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine has the right to use London-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia. \"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself.\"\n\nAlthough Moscow claims that five regions of Ukraine, including Crimea, are Russian territory, it has been highly sensitive to the increasing calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike military targets within Russia itself. Putin earlier this week warned this could lead to \"serious consequences.\"\n\nIn a sign of the Kremlin's anxiety, Putin hinted that Russia could use nuclear strikes against small European nations if NATO allowed Ukraine to attack what he called \"deep in Russian territory.\" He warned that NATO officials \"should be fully aware of what is at stake.\"\n\n\"If Europe were to face those serious consequences, what will the United States do, considering our strategic arms parity? It is hard to tell,\" he said, referring to U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. \"Are they looking for a global conflict?\"\n\nUnder pressure from Kyiv and European allies, Biden's risk appetite has changed repeatedly over the course of the war when he decided to expand Ukraine's arsenal with Stinger missiles, HIMARS launchers, advanced missile defense systems, drones, helicopters, M1 Abrams tanks and fighter jets.\n\nAmid the restrictions on U.S. support for cross-border attacks, Ukraine has been using its own long-range attack drones to hit Russian civilian and military targets. But those aircraft have payload limitations and are not as effective.\n\nU.S. officials remain concerned about Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian territory, including the targeting of oil refineries and nuclear early-warning systems, fearing that they could dangerously unsettle Moscow. Washington conveyed its concerns to Kyiv about two attempted attacks over the past week against radar stations that provide conventional air defense as well as warning of nuclear launches by the West. At least one strike in Armavir, in Russia's Krasnodar region, appeared to have caused some damage.\n\nRussia's advances have also spurred discussion between allies about sending military trainers to Ukraine - another move long seen as potentially escalatory. But conditions on the battlefield seem to have convinced some allies that it makes sense to take the training closer to Ukraine's troops, allowing them to move more quickly and easily to the front line afterward.\n\nIn February, French President Emmanuel Macron surprised many by suggesting that \"nothing should be ruled out\" when it comes to sending trainers to Ukraine, but he did not offer concrete details.\n\nUkraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrsky, announced this week that Ukraine and France had signed an agreement for French soldiers to train troops on Ukrainian soil, then quickly walked it back, saying the issue was still up for discussion.\n\nBut French officials pointedly did not deny that talks were advancing, leading to speculation that an announcement about some sort of training mission could come soon.\n\nAny training, NATO diplomats stressed, would be organized between member states and Ukraine bilaterally, not by NATO itself, which has kept an official distance from the war.\n\nBiden has long ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine.

would be \"serious consequences\" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia, as sought by Kyiv.\n\n\"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\" Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan.\n\n\"In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with,\" he said, noting that many European

And such actions of theirs may well become a casus belli,' said Medvedev.\n\nThe USS Florida launches an American-made Tomahawk cruise missile (File image)\n\nUkrainian soldiers of the 80th brigade firing artillery at Russian positions in the direction of Bakhmut\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (pictured) talks during an award ceremony at the Kremlin\n\n'No matter how much retired NATO farts chatter that Russia will never use non-strategic nuclear weapons against...Ukraine, and even more so in individual NATO countries, life is much worse than their frivolous reasoning,' he said.\n\n'A few years ago, they insisted that Russia would not enter into an open military conflict with [Ukraine], so as not to quarrel with the West.'\n\nThis was a miscalculation as the current war shows.\n\n'The use of tactical nuclear weapons can also be miscalculated, although this would be a fatal mistake,' said Medvedev, who was Russian president with his finger on the nuclear button from 2008 to 2012.\n\n'After all, as the President of Russia rightly noted, European countries have a very high population density.\n\n'And for those enemy countries whose lands are further than the coverage area of tactical nuclear weapons, there is finally a strategic potential.\n\n'And this, alas, is not intimidation or a nuclear bluff.\n\n'The current military conflict with the West is developing according to the worst possible scenario.\n\n'There is a constant escalation in the power of applicable NATO weapons.\n\n'Therefore, today no one can rule out the transition of the conflict to its final stage.'\n\nThe US, along with the rest of the West, has largely resisted Ukraine's pleas to be given permission to use Western missiles on Russian targets, anxious that this would draw NATO too close to the conflict.\n\nBut ahead of a NATO meeting in Prague on Thursday, the bloc's chief Jens Stoltenberg had said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had also insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to 'neutralise' bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500million euros (\u00a3426million) on Thursday.\n\nAs the West further deliberates the matter, Kharkiv police warned that residents could still be trapped underneath the rubble of buildings downed by the strikes.\n\n'A man and a woman were killed as a result of an enemy munition hitting a multi-storey residential building... The fourth and fifth floors of one of the building's sections were completely destroyed,' police said in a statement, adding that another munition killed a guard at a civilian production facility.\n\nFirefighters put out a fire an apartment building damaged in the Russian missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine\n\nAs the West further deliberates the matter, Kharkiv police warned that residents could still be trapped underneath the rubble of buildings downed by the strikes\n\nUkraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles\n\nRegional Governor Oleg Synegubov noted in a Telegram post that an emergency medic was among the wounded, adding: 'The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot.'\n\nKharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been 'a single military person, not a single military object' present.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles.\n\nRussian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, an oil depot was damaged in an aerial attack, its governor said Friday morning, noting that a major drone incursion elsewhere in the region had been repelled by air defences.\n\n'The situation is more serious in Temryuk district - the oil depot infrastructure there was damaged by an air strike.

The US is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE\n\nRussian jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make Nato allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesperson said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nIn Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical borders on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ...

Those conditions were intended to avoid escalation with Russia and prevent Ukraine's allies from being drawn directly into the conflict.\n\nBut Ukraine has contended recently that Russian forces are exploiting those limitations to mass troops near the border and stage attacks against Ukrainian territory.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the US government confirmed that it had authorized Ukraine to use American weapons in limited situations against targets on Russian territory.

From what I understand there will be progress,\" a senior Czech official familiar with the discussions told The Telegraph.\n\nThe source credited President Emmanuel Macron's decision this week to allow French weapons to be used to \"neutralise\" Russian targets over the border\n\nJan Lipavsky, the Czech foreign minister, told reporters: \"I feel that we are moving on that in the international sphere.\"\n\nMr Blinken was said to have changed his mind on the use of American weapons after he was warned by President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine could lose Kharkiv, its second-largest city, on a \"sobering visit\" to Kyiv this month, The New York Times reported.\n\nAn anonymous US official told the newspaper that it was \"inevitable\" that Mr Biden would reverse its the ban.\n\nThe White House is also understood to be cautious about allowing Ukraine's position on the battlefield to deteriorate too much ahead of Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July.\n\nSources said Russian advances would be used by Donald Trump, who is expected to be officially named the Republican presidential candidate days after the gathering, to further undermine Mr Biden's flagship policy of defending Ukraine.\n\nToday's live coverage has ended. Thank you for following the day's events.\n\nUkraine will receive 50,000-100,000 shells in June under a Czech-led initiative to buy ammunition for the war-ravaged country largely outside Europe, a Czech official said on Thursday.\n\nTomas Kopecny, the Czech government envoy for Ukraine reconstruction, told reporters that Ukraine, battling a Russian invasion since February 2022, could get millions of shells if allies managed to collect the money.\n\n\"The first delivery under the umbrella of this Czech initiative will be in June, and it will be dozens of thousands of shells, between 50 and 100,\" he said on the fringes of a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague.\n\nMr Kopecny urged further contributions as Ukraine will need 200,000 shells a month in the next two years \"just to make the balance\" vis-a-vis Russia.\n\nRussia should consider a \"demonstrative\" nuclear explosion to warn the West about allowing their weapons to be fired across the border from Ukraine, advisors to the Kremlin said.\n\nDmitry Suslov, a member of the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defence Policy think tank, said a test detonation could cow the West, which is in the process of relaxing rules about the weapons it gives to Ukraine.\n\nThe think tank is influential in Kremlin circles and its ideas sometimes become government policy for the Kremlin.\n\nThe proposal was issued a day after Vladimir Putin warned the West that Nato members in Europe were playing with fire by relaxing its weapons rules.\n\nThe Russian president said it could trigger a global conflict, with Russia, which possesses the world's largest nuclear arsenal, at the centre.\n\nThe US and Germany have so far refused to allow their weapons to be used inside Russia, while French President Emmanuel Macron followed the UK to shift his stance on Tuesday.\n\nNato leaders are due to meet later today to focus on efforts to hammer out a support package for Ukraine.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron will host a meeting with US President Joe Biden and his wife Jill on June 8 as part of Biden's first state visit to France, the French presidency said on Thursday.\n\nThe pair will discuss their ongoing support for Ukraine, as well as ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation on economic, space and nuclear issues, a statement from the French presidency said.\n\nUkrainian firefighters have been working to put out numerous fires caused by Russian shelling in the village of Mala Danilivka in the Kharkiv district of Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks injured at least seven people.\n\nOne of the strikes hit a children's equestrian club.\n\nThe opinion of Nato allies is shifting towards allowing Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike military targets on Russian soil, the Czech foreign minister said on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Jan Lipavsky said there was a growing belief that it was better to allow Kyiv to destroy Russian aircraft before they can take-off armed with bombs destined for Ukrainian cities.\n\nHe said it was right to relax restrictions on weapons and show \"strong resolve\" in response to Russia's changing tactics and escalations, including attacks on Poland and the UK, since Vladimir Putin's re-election.\n\nThe minister also dismissed concerns that slacker measures would result in the war spreading beyond Ukraine's borders.\n\nMr Lipavsky said: \"The message is simple... The plane is flying with rockets, it's better that the plane is not flying at all. If it's flying, it's better to shoot it down, rather than trying to shoot down rockets flying over Ukraine.\n\n\"We have to make use of logic and, also, international law, and the charter of the UN clearly says that you can protect yourself from aggression.\n\nI understand those concerns, I understand there are weapon systems that can be used quite far away. We have the discussions, but I feel that we are even moving on that in the international sphere.\"\n\nIn response to Kremlin threats of retaliation, he added: \"Russia has decided to escalate. It is Putin after the inauguration, he feels strongly. He started an offensive in Kharkiv. We saw the provocations at the Narva River, the attempts of sabotage, some of them successful, on the territories of Poland and the UK.\n\n\"I'm sure that we will see more of this escalation, so we need to repeat properly and definitely shouldn't be afraid, but show strong resolve to defend ourselves.\"\n\nSri Lanka's foreign ministry said Thursday it is seeking the release of hundreds of its ex-soldiers fighting for Russia as well as around a dozen prisoners of war in Ukraine.\n\nSri Lanka opened an inquiry this month into illegal recruitment for the conflict, identifying 455 ex-soldiers who had gone to fight for Russia.\n\nColombo is sending a delegation to Russia in June to negotiate their discharge, including 37 wounded Sri Lankans, Tharaka Balasuriya, state minister for foreign affairs, told reporters.\n\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe is also due to speak with his Ukrainian counterpart to plead for the release of \"10 to 12 Sri Lankan POWs\", Mr Balasuriya added. \"We are trying to get them released.\"\n\nAt least 16 Sri Lankans have been killed in Ukraine while fighting alongside Russian troops, parliament was told this month.\n\n\"We want to stop Sri Lankans going to Russia and Ukraine,\" Balasuriya said alongside the Russian ambassador to Colombo.\n\nHere are the latest photos from the front line in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian military tanks are in taking part in ongoing military training as the war continues in Donetsk Oblast.\n\nUkraine destroyed two Russian patrol boats off Moscow-annexed Crimea with naval drones, GUR military intelligence service said on Thursday.\n\nThe GUR agency wrote on Telegram that its Group 13 special forces unit using Ukrainian naval drones \"successfully attacked the boats of the aggressor state of Russia in temporarily occupied Crimea\".\n\nIt said that Russia used fighter planes and helicopters to try to destroy the drones in the Vuzka bay in northwestest Crimea, as well as firing on them using small arms and 30 mm cannons.\n\n\"As a result of the strike, two Russian boats were destroyed,\" GUR said, adding that according to preliminary data, they were high-speed amphibious vessels of the KS-701 Tunets type.\n\nThe Kremlin said Thursday that Nato member states were \"provoking\" Kyiv into prolonging the conflict in Ukraine, whose leaders are appealing to Western countries to allow it to target Russia.\n\n\"Nato member states ... are entering a new round of escalations in tensions and they are doing it deliberately,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that, \"they are provoking Ukraine in every possible way into continuing this senseless war.\"\n\nFrance could soon send military trainers to Ukraine despite the concerns of some allies and criticism by Russia, and may announce its decision next week during a visit by the Ukrainian president, three diplomatic sources said.\n\nThe diplomats said Paris hoped to forge and lead a coalition of countries offering such assistance to Kyiv's war effort even though some of its European Union partners fear it could make a direct conflict with Russia more likely.\n\nFrance would initially send a limited number of personnel to assess the modalities of a mission before dispatching several hundred trainers, two of the diplomats said.\n\nTraining would centre around demining, keeping equipment operational and technical expertise for warplanes to be provided by the West, they said. Paris would also finance, arm, and train a Ukrainian motorised brigade.\n\n\"The arrangements are very advanced and we could expect something next week,\" said one of the sources.\n\nThe international row over whether Ukraine should be allowed to use Western weapons to strike targets on Russian soil will dominate this week's meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague.\n\nThe Americans will arrive in the Czech capital under pressure to relax the rules on their donations, after a string of public easing of restrictions.\n\nJens Stoltenberg, Nato's departing secretary-general, has launched a campaign to convince allies to change their minds.\n\nHis attempt is seen largely futile, given donations to Ukraine are managed bilaterally and not through the Western military alliance.\n\nBut a growing coalition, led by the Brits, French and Eastern Europeans, will work hard to convince their American counterparts that it is the right thing to do, given Russia is launching more attacks from its own soil.\n\nElsewhere, ministers will attempt to find ways to satisfy Ukraine given the war-torn country won't be offered a clear pathway to membership, as reported by the Telegraph earlier this week.\n\nPlans for a $100 billion war chest to bring Kyiv's armed forces to Nato standard, presented by Mr Stoltenberg in March, have already run into difficulties, given some member states' reluctance to give Nato greater involvement in weapons deliveries, amid fears it could drag the alliance into a wider war with Russia.\n\nRussia is building up forces near the northern part of Ukraine's Kharkiv region where it launched an offensive this month, but it still lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push in the area, Ukraine's top commander said on Thursday.\n\nUkraine says it has stabilised the front in the northeastern Kharkiv region where Russian forces launched a cross-border assault on May 10 that opened a new front in the 27-month-old war and stretched Kyiv's outnumbered troops.\n\nColonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to send additional regiments and brigades from other areas and from training grounds to bulk up its troops on two main lines of attack in Kharkiv region's north.\n\nThat includes the Strilecha-Lyptsi area between two small villages and the vicinity of the border town of Vovchansk where there has been street fighting.\n\n\"These forces are currently insufficient for a large-scale offensive and breakthrough of our defence,\" Syrskyi said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHe said Ukraine's \"creation of an ammunition reserve\" had also reduced the offensive capabilities of Russian forces.\n\nCars and drones were given to Ukrainian servicemen during a handing-over ceremony in Kyiv.\n\nA total of 38 different vehicles and 40 drones were bought by Kyiv's community and handed to the 92nd Assault Brigade fighting in the Kharkiv region.\n\nRussian forces launched a series of missiles early on Thursday on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, injuring at least four people and damaging infrastructure, local officials said.\n\nMayor Ihor Terekhov, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said four people had been injured, a gas pipeline had been damaged and many windows had been broken.\n\nRegional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said eight missiles had been fired at the city, a frequent Russian target in recent weeks. A community just north of the city had also been hit.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strikes, air raid alerts remained in force throughout the country.\n\nItaly will never send any troops to Ukraine and any weapons it has supplied to Kyiv should not be used on Russian territory, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Thursday.\n\n\"All the weapons leaving from Italy (to Ukraine) should be used within Ukraine,\" Mr Tajani said in a TV interview with public broadcaster RAI.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Italy has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, but Rome has never disclosed any details about its military aid.\n\nMr Tajani also dismissed the possibility that former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi could become the next EU Commission President.\n\n\"Draghi is not an (official) candidate and does not belong to any (European) political family... I see it as a complicated matter,\" he said.\n\nNato has just five per cent of the air defence capabilities it needs to protect Europe from Russia, confidential defence plans show.\n\nA senior Nato diplomat admitted to the Financial Times that the ability to defend against missiles and air strike attacks was \"a major part of the plan to defend eastern Europe from invasion\", adding: \"And right now, we don't have that.\"\n\nA second Nato diplomat added that air defence \"is one of the biggest holes we have\" on the eastern flank. \"We can't deny it,\" they said.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has highlighted the need for strong air defence as Russia pummels its forces with daily bombing raids.\n\nLast year, the UK government described the \"challenge of protecting... against attack from the skies\" as being \"its most acute for over 30 years\".\n\nUkraine's air defence systems destroyed seven Russia-launched missiles and 32 drones overnight, its air force commander said on Thursday.\n\nThe air force official said on the Telegram messaging app that Russia had launched a total of 51 missiles and drones.\n\nThe commander said Russian forces attacked \"military facilities and critical infrastructure in Ukraine\" but did not provide additional details.\n\nMayor of eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said in a separate statement that critical infrastructure in the city was shelled last night and four people were injured.\n\nOther civilian and military authorities did not report casualties and destruction caused by the attacks.\n\nNato foreign ministers are set to meet in Prague on Thursday amid growing calls for leading allies to lift restrictions stopping Kyiv from using Western weapons to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe two-day gathering is meant to focus on efforts to hammer out a package of support for Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has been pressing its supporters to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry that they supply to hit targets inside Russia.\n\nThe US and Germany have so far refused out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nAhead of the meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift his stance when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz remained less committal, saying Ukraine should act within the law - and Berlin had not supplied the weapons to hit Russia anyway.\n\nThe White House said it still opposed Ukraine using US arms to strike inside Russia, although Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted that that strategy could change.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Thursday that it neutralised 13 Ukrainian aerial drones in the southern Krasnodar region and close to the annexed Crimean peninsula.\n\nOn Thursday morning, \"five Ukrainian aerial drones were shot down by anti-aircraft defence systems in the Krasnodar region,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nAnother eight drones were intercepted during the night \"over the Black Sea, close to the Crimean coast\", the statement added.\n\nThe Russian army also said it had destroyed two Ukrainian naval drones in the Black Sea that were \"heading for Crimea\".\n\nEight tactical ATACMS missiles were shot down by Russian air defence systems over the Sea of Azov, near Crimea.\n\nFaced with more than two years of Russian bombardments, Ukraine has taken the fight to Russian soil, often targeting energy infrastructure across the border.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised anew a risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorized Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nBiden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE\n\nRussian jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nIn Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical borders on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ... Ukraine has the right to defend itself according to the rules of humanitarian law.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet in Prague, Alan Charlish in Warsaw and Enrico Sciacovelli in Gdansk; Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten, Gareth Jones and Alison Williams)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Moscow mounted more strikes on Kharkiv, killing more civilians. And the White House reportedly gave Kyiv the green light for limited attacks on targets inside Russia.\n\nHere are some of the key developments in Russia over the past week and some of the takeaways going forward.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has long acted as if he's an expert on the history of Ukraine - or, as he has wrongly asserted many times, its lack of a meaningful history distinct from Russia.\n\nHe has used this inaccurate version of history to justify the full-scale invasion of Ukraine both before and after he launched it in February 2022, particularly in what one commentator called a \"lengthy, tortured article\" published seven months earlier. It was part of a series of spoken and written statements in which he used a false version of the past to seek to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Ukraine and its leadership.\n\nPutin has also bent more recent history to serve his argument against Ukraine, falsely claiming that the downfall of Moscow-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 - to which Russia responded by seizing Crimea and fomenting war in the Donbas - was the result of a Western-backed coup d'etat.\n\nNow Putin is casting himself as an expert on Ukraine's current affairs and its constitution as well: At least twice in the past week, he asserted that Zelenskiy is illegitimate because, under normal circumstances, a presidential vote would have been held two months ago. And, he claimed, the incumbent's authority is not prolonged when elections are canceled under martial law.\n\nSo, here's the formula: First, invade a neighboring nation without provocation, starting the biggest war in Europe since 1945, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and devastated a country. Next, say the president of that country is illegitimate because the war you started led to the cancellation of elections.\n\nAbsurd, perhaps, and a jaw-dropping piece of attempted gaslighting. Putin, meanwhile, started his fifth Kremlin term this month and has been president or prime minister since August 1999. In 2020, he engineered a change in the Russian Constitution that could keep him in power into 2036.\n\nBut he may have gotten what he wanted: Western media articles treated Putin's remarks in a remarkably straightforward way, as if he was simply airing his opinion on a debate in another country - and as if his opinion on the matter was one that should be taken into account.\n\nPutin's comments may have also been part of an ongoing effort by the Kremlin to suggest that Russia is potentially open to peace talks but that Ukraine is creating obstacles.\n\nThey may also have been meant to play into discussions of the issue in Ukraine, where struggles on the battlefield are causing political tension, and to draw attention away from Russia's actions in the war itself.\n\nIn the last few weeks, those actions include persistent, intensified air attacks on the city of Kharkiv and an offensive on a new front that Russia has opened up by pressing across the border north of the city and seizing territory on the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn both cases, these attacks are killing soldiers and civilians. In one of the deadliest strikes on a civilian target since the start of the full-scale invasion, a bomb attack killed at least 19 people at a Kharkiv home goods hypermarket full of shoppers on a Saturday.\n\nIt was another reminder of how Putin has turned back the clock, erasing years of efforts by people in Ukraine to live normal lives in peace more than 30 years after the country threw off Moscow's yoke when the U.S.S.R. fell apart and the disastrous Soviet experiment ended after seven calamitous decades.\n\nThe attacks in the Kharkiv region turned up the pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden to let Ukraine use U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia, something the White House long opposed, citing concerns about potential escalation.\n\nOn May 30, multiple media outlets cited U.S. officials as saying on condition of anonymity that the Biden administration has given Ukraine the green light to strike inside Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region.\n\nPolitico, which was the first to report the policy change, said that Biden had \"recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them.\"\n\nThe limits to the decision mean it may not be a game changer.\n\n\"For this relaxation to have a wider impact on the war, the geographic limitations of the current decision would have to be removed,\" military analyst Mick Ryan wrote.\n\nStill, he said, Putin and his advisers \"now have just a little bit more uncertainty to consider in their strategic decision-making about their brutal invasion and occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Kyiv had the \"right under international law to defend itself\" against attacks coming from inside Russia, close to the border with Ukraine, Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement.\n\nGermany and other Western allies supporting Ukraine's defense were \"convinced that Ukraine has the right (...) to defend itself against these attacks,\" Hebestreit said. \"To this end, it can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose (...) including those supplied by us.\"\n\nRussian attacks from its own territory had increased in recent weeks, in particular around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, where Moscow's forces have opened a new front in the war, Hebestreit said.\n\nGermany, Kyiv's biggest military backer behind only the United States, has delivered stacks of military equipment to Ukraine, including heavy artillery and rocket launchers. Berlin has up until now been reluctant to allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike Russian targets for fear of escalating the conflict.\n\nBut with Ukrainian forces coming under increased pressure, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with Western allies for more weapons and a freer hand in deploying those already delivered. The issue was on the agenda as French President Emmanuel Macron visited Germany earlier in the week. Kyiv should be allowed to \"neutralize\" Russian military bases used to fire missiles into Ukraine, Macron said Tuesday in a press conference with Scholz.\n\nSubsequently, officials in Washington indicated on Thursday that President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions on US-supplied weapons to allow Kyiv to hit targets in Russia in defense of the Kharkiv region.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr",

AP-Yonhap\n\nThe German government has authorized Ukraine to use German-supplied weapons against military targets in Russia, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit announced on Friday.\n\nUkraine has pressed supporters in recent weeks for permission to use weapons supplied by the West to strike Russian forces on Russian territory.\n\nSeveral other countries, including the United States, have recently made similar moves to give Ukraine more leeway in its use of Western-supplied weapons, after previously specifying that they should only be used against targets within Ukraine itself.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks from positions in the Kharkiv area in particular from the immediately neighbouring Russian border region,\" Hebestreit said on Friday.\n\nHebestreit said there is consensus that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks.\n\n\"It can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations, including those supplied by us,\" said Hebestreit.\n\nIn theory, several weapons systems supplied by Germany could be used to counter Russian attacks from the border region, including the Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzer and Mars II rocket launchers.\n\nMany Western countries initially put conditions on military aid packages that limited Ukraine to use those weapons only Ukrainian territory. Those conditions were intended to avoid escalation with Russia and prevent Ukraine's allies from being drawn directly into the conflict.\n\nBut Ukraine has contended recently that Russian forces are exploiting those limitations to mass troops near the border and stage attacks against Ukrainian territory.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the US government confirmed that it had authorized Ukraine to use American weapons in limited situations against targets on Russian territory. The weapons are to be used to defend against attacks on Kharkiv and to hit Russian forces that are preparing attacks.\n\nThe shift in the movement by Western allies came after the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Germany held intensive high-level discussions earlier this week on the use of Western weapons.

Fighting has been raging in the area for the past three weeks after Russian troops poured over the border to open a new front in the war.\n\nBut hitting targets with American weapons inside Russia had been a red line drawn by the Biden administration because of worries about escalation before the cross-border fighting began near Kharkiv. Russia has been launching missiles and gathering forces in the safety of its own territory, out of range of Ukraine's Soviet-era weaponry.\n\nThe assaults have prompted urgent appeals from Ukraine for the Biden administration to remove the shackles, framing the use of Western weapons as a purely defensive tactic. Indeed, in granting permission, U.S. officials said the weapons should only be used in self-defense in the border region.\n\nStill, it was a significant reversal that Ukraine hopes will help it regain its footing in a war that Russia is now dominating, and was a historic moment for the U.S. as well: It appeared to be the first time an American president had allowed the limited use of American weapons to strike inside the borders of a nuclear-armed adversary.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/31/multimedia/31ukraine-weapons-tfgq/31ukraine-weapons-tfgq-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles - the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. The tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria\u00b4s civil war.\n\nA Russian onslaught this month in the northeastern Kharkiv region, including a Russian aerial bomb attack on a large construction supplies store that killed 18 people on May 25, has forced the evacuation of thousands of people and has stretched Ukraine\u00b4s depleted forces in what is proving to be a critical period in the war, which is now in its third year.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials,\n\nThe Kremlin\u00b4s bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe\u00b4s inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nFirefighters put out a fire an apartment building damaged in the Russian missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Friday, May, 31, 2024. (AP Photo/Andrii Marienko)\n\nBiden\u00b4s decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThat restriction has frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military is unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border - Kharkiv city is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia - or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West\u00b4s direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nFollow AP\u00b4s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nPeople react after the Russian missile attack hit their apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Friday, May, 31, 2024.

According to various sources inside the Biden administration, the United States has decided to allow Kyiv to carry out strikes on Russian soil using Western weapons. The green light was given on condition that the Ukrainians limit their strikes to the border areas of the Kharkiv region in the north of the country, where Russian forces entered on May 10 and have since conquered more than 180 square kilometers.\n\n\"The president [Joe Biden] recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official told Agence France-Presse on Thursday, May 30, confirming an initial report from Politico. The White House's position on long-range strikes inside Russia, on the other hand, has not changed. These remain prohibited by Washington, say the same sources.\n\nThis change in the American position follows intense pressure from Ukraine and some of its allies, who believe that Moscow's new offensive has changed the situation. By attacking Ukraine from its national territory, and not from the territories it occupies in the oblasts of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, Russia is preventing Kyiv's forces from taking action, as the Ukrainians do not have the capacity to target troop concentrations or aircraft operating from within their enemy's borders.\n\n\"US policy has effectively created a vast sanctuary in which Russia has been able to amass its ground invasion force and from which it is launching glide bombs and other long-range strike systems in support of its renewed invasion,\" wrote the American think-tank Institute for the Study of War, in a note published on May 13. Following the May 10 attack on Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, Ukrainians are particularly worried about a new build-up of Russian troops further north, in the Sumy region.\n\nThis loosening of US policy comes after intense debate within the Biden administration. For several weeks, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in favor of limited strikes on Russian soil, had been opposing the firm stance of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who believes the risk of escalation with Moscow is too great. During a visit to Kyiv on May 15, Blinken made his first overture, asserting that \"ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it's going to conduct this war.\" The statement was immediately denied by the Pentagon and the White House.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

President Joe Biden has partially lifted the ban\n\nFears are on the rise for worsening tensions in Ukraine after a change in American policy would see US weapons used to attack Russia.\n\nUkrainian officials stepped up pressure on all its allies to allow them to hit Russian targets with western weapons. And now president Joe Biden has partially lifted the ban, but the change is understood to apply only to defend the area of Kharkiv. Ahead of the change Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been making the case that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an \"untenable situation\" as Russia had intensified attacks around the northeast region.\n\nA number of European countries, including France, Germany and the UK, have signalled they are open to an easing of restrictions on how Ukraine can use weapons supplied by the West. But the US, which has provided the bulk of Ukraine's weaponry, has resisted easing these restrictions over fears of escalation.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron has voiced direct support for the move, saying Ukraine should be \"allowed\" to use weapons supplied by the West against military sites on Russian territory, although strictly not on civilian targets. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is more reserved in public but a spokesman in Berlin told reporters that \"defensive action is not limited to one's own territory, but also includes the territory of the aggressor\".\n\nDavid Cameron, the UK's foreign secretary said earlier this month that it was up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons, and the Polish Deputy Defence Minister said that Ukrainians could use Polish weapons \"as they see fit\".\n\nKharkiv is Ukraine's second largest city and is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod.

Approving new uses for U.S. weapons would give kyiv a way to carry out counterattacks against artillery and missile sites that now enjoy a sort of safe haven just inside Russia.\n\nIn Moldova on Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken became the first administration official to publicly leave open the possibility that the Biden administration could adapt and adjust its stance regarding attacks inside Russia with American weapons, depending on changing battlefield conditions.\n\nWe are still making decisions about what is necessary to ensure that Ukraine can continue to defend itself effectively, Blinken said.\n\nHis statement was the latest amid a wave of calls for change, from allies and Mr. Biden's administration. Mr. Blinken, who returned from a sobering trip to kyiv earlier this month, reported to the president that the Ukrainians may not be able to hold on to territory between Kharkiv and the Russian border unless Mr. Biden don't go back. That earlier warning was delivered privately, consistent with Mr. Biden's deep aversion to letting debates within his inner circle slip away and creating pressure on him to change strategy.\n\nEven before Mr. Blinken spoke publicly on Wednesday, Mr. Biden was under enormous pressure from his allies. NATO's usually cautious outgoing leader, Jens Stoltenberg, told The Economist in an interview published late last week that Ukraine's territorial losses near Kharkiv could only be countered if Ukraine was free to withdraw artillery, missile launchers and command posts from the Russian side. of the border.\n\nDenying Ukraine the ability to use these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very difficult to defend itself, Stoltenberg said. On Tuesday, French and German leaders joined this chorus. Britain already allows its weapons to be fired at military targets in Russia.\n\nSo far, Mr. Biden himself has remained silent, as he often does when faced with a major policy decision that is the subject of complex debates within the White House. His national security aides are conducting what is called a very rapid process to make a formal recommendation to the president, knowing that the momentum of the war is shifting toward Russia.\n\nSome of his advisers, refusing to speak officially on a debate at the White House, say they believe a reversal of his position is inevitable. But if the president changes his mind, it will most likely be accompanied by severe restrictions on how the Ukrainians could use U.S.-supplied weapons, limiting them to military targets just inside Russian borders and involved in the attacks against Ukraine.\n\nMr. Biden would likely maintain a ban on using U.S. weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory or against critical infrastructure. On this point, he enjoys the support of the allies: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz refused to supply Ukraine with the German long-range Taurus missile system, for fear that it would reach Moscow.\n\nMr. Biden doesn't have much time. In two weeks, he begins a month of intensive face-to-face meetings with his key allies, first at the 80th anniversary of D-Day, then at a meeting of G7 nations and finally at a celebration , in Washington, of the creation of NATO 75 years ago. During all these appearances, it will be essential to project unity.\n\nBut if Mr. Biden changes course, officials admit he will likely never announce it: Instead, American artillery shells and missiles will simply begin landing on Russian military targets.\n\nMr. Biden's two terms in the war, which do not allow Russia to win and do not risk triggering a Third World War, have always been in tension with each other. But in the 27 months since the Russian invasion, the need to choose between the possibility of Ukrainian defeat and direct involvement in attacks on the territory of a nuclear superpower has never been more stark.\n\nThe Kremlin, eager to make the choice more difficult, has leaned heavily on the narrative that the president risks escalation. Last week, it held a series of exercises on how to move and use its vast arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nAfter Stoltenberg's statement to The Economist, the Kremlin's top spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said NATO was flirting with military rhetoric and falling into military ecstasy, and that the Russian military knew how to respond. . Asked if the Western alliance was getting close to a direct confrontation with Russia, he replied: They are not getting close; they are in it.\n\nU.S. officials increasingly view these warnings as meaningless. Russia, they note, has never risked attacking the supply of weapons to Ukraine in Poland or elsewhere on NATO territory. President Vladimir V. Putin did everything he could to avoid direct conflict with the Western alliance, even as he flaunted his nuclear capabilities or warned, as Mr. Peskov regularly does, that the West risked transform a regional conflict into World War III.\n\nPutin is wielding the nuclear saber to prevent Biden from letting U.S. weapons be used to strike back, Joseph S. Nye, a former U.S. military official and head of the National Intelligence Council, said Tuesday. Mr. Nye, a professor emeritus at Harvard, emphasized that what is happening is a nuclear negotiation game and a credibility game.\n\nPutin has higher stakes in this matter, and he will do everything possible to get Biden out of the way first, he added.\n\nThis has been true since the early days of the war, when Mr. Putin ordered nuclear forces to be put on alert, in an effort to prevent NATO from helping Ukraine after the invasion. But after Mr. Putin's repeated threats that he might resort to nuclear weapons, Mr. Biden's aides appear increasingly unimpressed by the Russian president's statements.\n\nSeth G. Jones, a former U.S. military official who directs the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that after a recent trip to kyiv, he concluded that concerns about the use by Ukraine US weapons to strike war-related targets on Russian territory are misplaced.\n\nUkraine has a legitimate military need to weaken Russia's ability to wage war, he said, including by striking its oil production facilities and power plants. The United States did the same thing to Germany and Japan during World War II.\n\nMr Jones added that fears about a Russian escalation were overblown.\n\nThere has been no backlash against other NATO countries, such as the United Kingdom, whose weapons Ukraine uses to strike targets in Russia, he said. And Putin's threats of escalation since the start of the war have remained empty.\n\nBut considerable unease remains within the Biden administration over the possibility of nuclear escalation. A senior administration official said Washington had raised concerns with Mr. Zelensky's government about strikes against nuclear warning radar systems in Russia in recent weeks.\n\nTo carry out these attacks, the Ukrainians used locally produced drones and missiles. But U.S. officials have expressed concern that Moscow could misperceive Western intentions and told Ukraine they view maintaining early warning systems as essential to nuclear stability.\n\nEric

use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets on Russian soil.\n\nSome countries including Britain and the Netherlands say Kyiv has the right to use their weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken said the United States had \u201cadapted and adjusted\u201d as the \u201cbattlefield has changed\u201d, as he spoke to reporters on a visit to Moldova on the eve of Nato talks in Prague.\n\nBlinken, who travelled Kyiv earlier this month to see the increasingly grave situation as Russia pushes forward towards Kharkiv, had been widely reported to be pressing Biden to ease the rules.\n\nAhead of the Nato meeting, which starts with a dinner on Thursday, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said repeatedly it was time for members to reconsider those limits because they hampered Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \u201cneutralise\u201d bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law \u2013 and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nPressure has also been mounting ahead of a series of key meetings in Europe in coming weeks where Kyiv\u2019s plight will be in focus.\n\nBiden will attend ceremonies in France marking the World War II D-Day landings in early June where Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky will also be present.\n\nThe US president will also meet leaders of the world\u2019s top economies at the G7 summit in Italy.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning

However, despite Washington's new commitment, battlefield reports say that little of the promised materiel is arriving at the front. Increasingly frustrated, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been calling for permission to use the accurate and power missiles such as its HIMARS and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) to hit Russian supply logistics, Grad missile launchers and massed troops just over the border in Russia.\n\nThe Western efforts to resupply are going slowly, after Czechia's leading arms company said that it was being outbid by Russia in negotiations with non-EU shell manufacturers. The company complained that the Kremlin was getting funding to buy shells together faster than the Europeans and that shells intended for Ukraine were being sold to Moscow instead as a result.\n\nThe West has been reluctant to allow Ukraine to use its weapons on targets on Russian soil, afraid of provoking Russia into a direct confrontation with the Nato allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised that if Russia was hit by Nato weapons Russia would responds in kind and could target supplies for Ukraine based outside of Ukraine in what would be a dramatic escalation of the war.\n\nThe long-sought permission by Ukrainian leaders from Washington, will nearly double its striking distance to 300km by using the mid-range ATACMS missiles that it received from the US last October.\n\n\"We've already sent some, we will send more now that we have additional authority and money,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on May 30, as cited by AP. The additional ATACMS were included in a new military aid package signed by President Joe Biden on a day earlier.\n\nWashington first included the ATACMS in a February military package and significantly up the number in another March $300mn interim package ahead of the large aid package decision in April.\n\nPushing Russian forces back hundreds of kilometres from the border will also neutralise Russia's deadly glide bombs - heavy Soviet era gravity bombs that have been fitted with wings - that have an effective range of only around 100km but have been used to devastating effect on Ukraine's defensive positions near the border. Russia has thousands of these glide bombs that carry up to 1,500kg payload and in addition to being very hard to shoot down, are so powerful Ukraine's ground defences are largely ineffective against them.\n\nThe decision to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil and the delivery of ATACMS missiles was so secret that US lawmakers and others have been demanding the US send longer range missiles without knowing the decision had already been made and the missiles were already in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, as with most of the Nato-supplied weapons, permission to use the ATACMS on Russia proper has come with strict limitations. Russia's oil refineries have been hit with new Ukrainian long-range drones as part of a developing drone war this year, but its home made drones are not powerful enough to do more than superficial damage to Russian refineries but has reduced oil product production by some 14% this year.\n\nThe US has explicitly banned the use of the ATACMS missiles against targets further away inside Russia such as the oil refineries. As a further precaution, the US initially only sent Ukraine the mid-range version of the missile that is limited to 160km that puts only targets close to the Russo-Ukraine border into range, but not the refineries which are hundreds of kilometres or more from the frontline. However, the latest batch of missiles delivered have a longer range of some 300km as part of an ongoing creeping escalation.\n\nGrady told AP this week that long-range weapons will help Ukraine take out Russian logistics hubs and troop concentrations behind enemy lines on the Russian side of the border. Grady didn't give details of which missiles had been supplied, but said they will be \"very disruptive if used properly, and I'm confident they will be.\"\n\nUkraine has actually already used US-made missiles on targets that are inside Russia's territory, but limited the strikes to the occupied Crimea peninsula, which the Kremlin sees has Russian sovereign territory, but no one else does. The Kremlin apparently has accepted Ukraine missiles strikes on the Crimea as legitimate targets and has not escalated its retaliation, as it is threatening to do now if Ukraine hits targets in the Russian mainland around the city of Belgorod in western Russian.\n\nAt a White House press briefing, US National Security Advisor of Jake Sullivan said the administration \"has worked relentlessly to address [Ukraine's] concerns\" and stocks of missiles are now coming off the production line and the ATACMS can be sent to Ukraine without hurting US military readiness.\n\nRussia outbidding Czechia in race to buy shells\n\nThe US permission to strike at Russian forces inside its own territory comes as Czechia says it is being outbid by Russia in a race to source crucial 155mm artillery shells from non-EU manufacturers, the Financial Times reported on May 30.\n\nCzechia is spearheading a drive to buy $1bn worth of the crucial 155mm artillery shells that are the workhorse of Ukraine's military campaign and of which supplies have run desperately low.\n\nBut Russia is outpacing Western countries in acquiring artillery supplies on the international market, the Czech government has warned. Delayed payments to arms companies could result in millions of rounds of ammunition being sent to Moscow instead of Kyiv, according to Prague officials.\n\nOne of the motivations for the US decision to allow Ukraine to use its long-range missiles on Russia is that Russia received some of its long-range weapons from North Korea recently and has used them on the battlefield in Ukraine. A US official told AP that this development had contributed to prompting the Biden administration to greenlight the new long-range missiles policy for Ukraine.\n\nThe Czech government is finding it difficult to compete with the better funded Russia, which has been above to offer to the shell manufacturers more rapidly than Europe.\n\n\"There are some countries that are supplying [Ukraine] from the same stockpiles that the Russians are [buying from],\" Tomas Kopecny, Prague's envoy for the reconstruction of Ukraine, told the FT. \"If you have the cash to do the pre-payment faster than the Russians, then the products go to the Ukrainian side. If you don't have the cash on the account, then sometimes it goes to the Russians.\"\n\nThe competition between the Brussels and Moscow is pushing up prices that is adding to difficulties caused by low quality of the non-EU munitions. Czechia's largest ammunition supplier, Czechoslovak Group (CSG) says that, \"about 50% of the parts acquired by our company on behalf of the Czech government in places such as Africa and Asia were not good enough to be sent to Ukraine without further work,\" according to Michal Strnad, owner and chair of CSG, cited by the FT.\n\n\"The production capacity is out there. But it is not in Europe,\" Kopecny noted. He emphasized that the competition for ammunition with Russia involves \"single-digit millions of rounds,\" requiring adequate financial resources to secure them.\n\nStrnad points out that order books of European ammunition makers are full for the next eight years as there is no spare capacity to increase production in Europe. \"Even if Ukraine's war ended now, there would be huge work in front of us to replenish the strategic stocks of Nato countries,\" he said.\n\nTo address the shortfall, the Czech government has enlisted CSG and other smaller defence companies to source shells from non-EU countries. CSG is also in talks with Ukrainian authorities to build production facilities in Ukraine, which would include a factory for large-calibre shells, a truck assembly line, and a maintenance facility for weapons delivered to Kyiv.\n\n\"We would spend a few hundred million euros to launch these manufacturing projects in Ukraine and hope to reach an agreement with Kyiv this year,\" Strnad said.\n\nEU leaders from the Netherlands, Denmark, Latvia, and Poland, along with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, gathered in Prague to discuss Ukraine's weapons shortfall. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced that 15 EU and NATO countries had contributed \u20ac1.6 billion to the Czech initiative, which aims to deliver 1.5 million artillery shells to Ukraine. The first batch of tens of thousands of 155mm calibre shells is expected to be delivered next month.\n\nUkraine has been struggling to contain Russia largely due to a shortage of soldiers and ammunition. Shmyhal emphasized the need for fresh artillery ammunition and called on NATO allies to respond to Kyiv's request for seven additional Patriot air defence systems and more fighter jets.", "source":

The policy, announced yesterday afternoon at Washington, was triggered by Moscow opening a new front in Kharkiv Region, home to Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nThe policy change is restricted to the Kharkiv front and is dictated largely by the region's unique geography. Located 12 miles from the Russian border, the city has seen its eastern suburbs devastated by cross-border shelling from Russian howitzers out of reach of Ukrainian forces.\n\nPrior to the May 10 cross border incursion, Ukrainian military intelligence said they saw Russia massing troops in marshaling grounds just over the border. Russian artillery set up in Belgorod, out of range of Ukrainian artillery. When Ukrainians used earth moving equipment to dig defensive trenches, Russian artillery opened up with devastating effect.\n\nWhen the invasion came, the Russians crossed the border in small units covered by Russian war jets flying in Russian airspace. The jets unleashed GPS-guided bombs that glided across the border and hit with devastating effect.\n\nNow, under the new policy, Ukraine will be able to use American missiles to shoot down Russian warplanes flying in Russian airspace. On the ground, Ukrainian artillery crews will be able to fire across the border with the highly accurate High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or Himars.\n\nTargets are to be ammunition depots, electronic warfare units, and troop concentrations. They will not be able to use the Army Tactical Missile System, which would allow deep strikes into Russia, as far as 200 miles east.\n\nEntering into effect today, the new policy change caps a week where European support had snowballed. Public opinion was galvanized by Saturday's bombing in a Kharkiv suburb of targets including a hardware store. Amply documented in the world press, the bombing, by a pair of air launched glide bombs killed 19 people.\n\nAfter the bombing, country after country in the 32-nation NATO alliance announced that they were authorizing Ukraine to use their weapons to attack military sites inside Russia. By yesterday morning, the list had grown to 13. Included were such NATO heavyweights, such as Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe ban on hitting Russia forces Ukraine to fight \"with one hand tied behind its back,\" the Dutch defense minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said this week. She authorized Ukraine to use Dutch military aid it sees fit and appealed to the rest of NATO, saying lifting restrictions \"should not be subject to debate.\"\n\nPresident Macron of France agreed, arguing for restricted use of French cruise missiles. \"We should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and basically the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\" he said Tuesday at a joint press conference near Berlin with Chancellor Scholz of Germany. \"We should not allow other targets in Russia to be hit, civilian capacities of course, or other military targets.\"\n\nMr. Scholz said he agreed. However, his position was moot because he has refused to donate long-range missiles to Russia, notably the Taurus, which could potentially hit Moscow or take out the Kerch Bridge, linking Crimea and Russia's mainland.\n\n\"Part of the border is actually the front line,\" NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters at Brussels on Tuesday as reports emerged of Russia preparing another attack on northern Ukraine. \"Therefore, of course it will be very hard and difficult for the Ukrainians to defend themselves if they cannot hit military targets just on the other side of the border. These may be missile launchers. It may be artillery. It may be airfields which are used to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nMr. Stoltenberg essentially was lobbying his boss, President Biden. Washington pays for about two-thirds of NATO's budget and supplies about half of Western military aid to Ukraine. The alliance does not supply weapons to Ukraine. Donor countries set conditions on their use.\n\nWhile Biden Administration officials debated the policy behind closed doors, Republican and Democratic congressional representatives sent a letter to the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, demanding a change. For over a year, Russia bombed from its own soil Ukrainian military and civilian targets with foreign-made munitions -- North Korean ballistic missiles and Iranian Shahed drones.\n\nThe idea that Ukraine would do the same enrages the Kremlin. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin said Europe's NATO countries are playing with nuclear fire. \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\" Mr. Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan. \"In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with,\" he said. In a clear reference to the destructive power of nuclear bombs, he noted that many European countries have \"small territories\" and \"dense populations.\"\n\nThe next day, the leader of one small European nation with a dense population, Belgium's prime minister, Alexander De Croo, talked to reporters about the planned transfer of 30 US-made F-16 war jets to Ukraine over the next five years. \"Everything covered by this agreement is very clear: it is for utilization by the Ukrainian defense forces on Ukraine territory,\" he said, ruling out any use in Russian airspace.\n\nThis was not enough for the Kremlin. The next day, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told state-run news agency Ria Novosti that Moscow will see delivery of the aircraft as \"a signal action\" by NATO \"in the nuclear sphere.\" He added that \"We hope the Russian-Belarusian drills on the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons that are underway now will knock some sense into our opponents by reminding them about the catastrophic consequences of further nuclear escalation.\"\n\nProminent Russian TV presenter Dmitry Suslov proposes that the Kremlin go beyond nuclear training exercises and stage a \"demonstrative\" nuclear bomb test. The last time Moscow held such a test was in 1990 in the waning days of the Soviet Union. The site was Novaya Zemlya, Russia's Arctic archipelago.\n\nOne year ago, Ukraine started using American-supplied missiles to devastate Russian air bases and naval stations on Russia-controlled Crimea. For Mr. Putin, this was crossing a red line. However, in the eyes of the world and America, Crimea is sovereign Ukrainian territory. Now, the world waits to see how the Kremlin will respond to the West crossing Russia's latest red line.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors":

the defense of the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, according to Bild newspaper.\n\nRussian forces launched a surprise offensive in Kharkov Region and have made significant gains there in recent

I think sometimes they are just laughing at this situation,\" Zelenskiy told the Guardian in an interview published on Friday.\n\nThe German government announced on Friday that it would also give Ukraine permission to use weapons it supplied against military targets in Russian territory bordering the Kharkiv region to defend itself against Moscow's attacks.\n\nDuring a visit to Uzbekistan earlier this week, Putin warned against western countries allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to strike Russia. \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\" the Russian president said on Tuesday, without giving further detail.\n\nPutin also issued a thinly veiled threat against Nato's smaller European members, saying they \"should be aware that they are playing with fire\" because they had small land areas and very dense populations.\n\nIn the lead-up to Biden's decision on Thursday other western allies, including the UK, France, the Netherlands and the Nato secretary general, , also said Ukraine should be able to use western weapons against military targets in Russia.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former Russian president and current deputy chair of the country's security council, called Biden's decision a \"serious escalation of the conflict\".\n\n\"Russia regards all long-range weapons used by Ukraine as already being directly controlled by servicemen from Nato countries. This is no military assistance, this is participation in a war against us,\" he said, adding that Russia would destroy any western weaponry used to attack it \"both in Ukraine and in the territory of other countries\".\n\nMedvedev also said it would be a \"crucial mistake\" on the part of the west to believe that Russia was not ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine. He also spoke of the potential to strike unnamed hostile countries with strategic nuclear weapons. \"This is, alas, neither intimidation nor bluffing,\" he said.\n\nWestern countries' approval for the use of their weapons comes amid reports that France is planning to send military trainers to Ukraine, making it the first to publicly deploy troops on the ground.\n\nThe country's president, Emmanuel Macron, could announce the move next week during a visit by Zelenskiy, who will attend a ceremony in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-day.\n\nPutin has said the French move would escalate the situation toward a global conflict, and some senior officials in Moscow have said French trainers would become legitimate targets for Russian troops.\n\nIn the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin frequently invoked Moscow's nuclear arsenal, pledging to use all means necessary to defend his country. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, reportedly after Chinese officials persuaded him to abandon his nuclear threats, but he has recently returned to them.\n\nRussian forces started military drills near Ukraine last week that simulated the use of tactical nuclear weapons in a move Moscow said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further.\n\nSince the start of the war, Washington has voiced fears of provoking Putin into a nuclear response and drawing the US and Nato into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nIt has reportedly expressed anger over two Ukrainian drone strikes in the last week against Russian radar stations that provide warning of nuclear launches.\n\nAt least one of the strikes in the south-eastern Krasnodar region appeared to have caused some damage, according to images circulating on social media.\n\n\"They are sensitive locations because Russia could perceive that its strategic deterrent capabilities are being targeted, which could undermine Russia's ability to maintain nuclear deterrence against the United States,\" an unnamed US official told the Washington Post.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Moscow mounted more strikes on Kharkiv, killing more civilians. And the White House reportedly gave Kyiv the green light for limited attacks on targets inside Russia.\n\nHere are some of the key developments in Russia over the past week and some of the takeaways going forward.\n\nA 'Tortured Article'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has long acted as if he's an expert on the history of Ukraine - or, as he has wrongly asserted many times, its lack of a meaningful history distinct from Russia.\n\nHe has used this inaccurate version of history to justify the full-scale invasion of Ukraine both before and after he launched it in February 2022, particularly in what one commentator called a \"lengthy, tortured article\" published seven months earlier. It was part of a series of spoken and written statements in which he used a false version of the past to seek to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Ukraine and its leadership.\n\nPutin has also bent more recent history to serve his argument against Ukraine, falsely claiming that the downfall of Moscow-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 - to which Russia responded by seizing Crimea and fomenting war in the Donbas - was the result of a Western-backed coup d'etat.\n\nNow Putin is casting himself as an expert on Ukraine's current affairs and its constitution as well: At least twice in the past week, he asserted that Zelenskiy is illegitimate because, under normal circumstances, a presidential vote would have been held two months ago. And, he claimed, the incumbent's authority is not prolonged when elections are canceled under martial law.\n\nSo, here's the formula: First, invade a neighboring nation without provocation, starting the biggest war in Europe since 1945, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and devastated a country. Next, say the president of that country is illegitimate because the war you started led to the cancellation of elections.\n\nAbsurd, perhaps, and a jaw-dropping piece of attempted gaslighting. Putin, meanwhile, started his fifth Kremlin term this month and has been president or prime minister since August 1999. In 2020, he engineered a change in the Russian Constitution that could keep him in power into 2036.\n\nMission Accomplished?\n\nBut he may have gotten what he wanted: Western media articles treated Putin's remarks in a remarkably straightforward way, as if he was simply airing his opinion on a debate in another country - and as if his opinion on the matter was one that should be taken into account.\n\nPutin's comments may have also been part of an ongoing effort by the Kremlin to suggest that Russia is potentially open to peace talks but that Ukraine is creating obstacles.\n\nThey may also have been meant to play into discussions of the issue in Ukraine, where struggles on the battlefield are causing political tension, and to draw attention away from Russia's actions in the war itself.\n\nIn the last few weeks, those actions include persistent, intensified air attacks on the city of Kharkiv and an offensive on a new front that Russia has opened up by pressing across the border north of the city and seizing territory on the Ukrainian side.\n\nA Policy Shift\n\nIn both cases, these attacks are killing soldiers and civilians. In one of the deadliest strikes on a civilian target since the start of the full-scale invasion, a bomb attack killed at least 19 people at a Kharkiv home goods hypermarket full of shoppers on a Saturday.\n\nIt was another reminder of how Putin has turned back the clock, erasing years of efforts by people in Ukraine to live normal lives in peace more than 30 years after the country threw off Moscow's yoke when the U.S.S.R. fell apart and the disastrous Soviet experiment ended after seven calamitous decades.\n\nThe attacks in the Kharkiv region turned up the pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden to let Ukraine use U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia, something the White House long opposed, citing concerns about potential escalation.\n\nOn May 30, multiple media outlets cited U.S. officials as saying on condition of anonymity that the Biden administration has given Ukraine the green light to strike inside Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region.\n\nPolitico, which was the first to report the policy change, said that Biden had \"recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them.\"\n\nThe limits to the decision mean it may not be a game changer.\n\n\"For this relaxation to have a wider impact on the war, the geographic limitations of the current decision would have to be removed,\" military analyst Mick Ryan wrote.\n\nStill, he said, Putin and his advisers \"now have just a little bit more uncertainty to consider in their strategic decision-making about their brutal invasion and occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"\n\nP.S.: Consider forwarding this newsletter to colleagues who might find this of interest.

It has always been the case for a long time that every time NATO Allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us not to do that.\"\n\nBritish Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has previously emphasised that UK weapons supplied to Kyiv could be used throughout Ukraine and in Crimea, annexed in a widely-viewed illegal move in 2014 by Russia.\n\nBut he declined to say whether this consent also covered striking targets inside Russia.\n\nHe told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg earlier this month: \"We do not get into how we would allow targeting of our weapons to be used outside of that (the whole of Ukraine), but we do provide our weapons to Ukraine in order for them to defend their country.\"\n\nBritain has led the way in arming Ukraine to defend against

President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior officials in his government pushed for the change with growing urgency as Russia continued its assault there, emboldened by the Kremlin's knowledge of Washington's red lines, according to reports. Kiev officials.\n\nThe move draws Biden even deeper into a war in which Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly raised the prospect of a nuclear strike, a concern for a U.S. leader who matured amid the U.S.-Soviet nuclear clashes of the 1960s Biden has been cautious about escalation, but he is also aware that the Ukrainians have repeatedly been granted greater capabilities and faced a Kremlin that has failed to respond.\n\nIn recent days, a growing number of the United States' European allies have also urged the administration to drop its opposition, signaling their intention to authorize the use of their own weapons against military targets on Russian soil. Although Ukraine used some European weapons as well as its own to fight back, Washington's decision was the most significant because of the quantity and quality of its equipment.\n\nThis change allows Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied artillery and rocket launchers to strike Russian troops and equipment just across the border from Kharkiv and to strike missiles aimed at Ukrainian territory, U.S. officials said. They stressed that the Biden administration's policy prohibiting longer-range strikes in Russia has not changed.\n\nThis meets the Ukrainian request, which was to be able to respond to attacks emanating from this area of Russia's Belgorod region, to be able to strike Russian forces and weapons depots, a US official said, adding that Ukraine does not was unable to respond to Ukraine's request. asking for a general policy change and let's not change this policy.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Speaking earlier Thursday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesman, blasted the United States and its NATO allies, saying the alliance was responsible for sparking a further escalation of tensions.\n\nThey do it deliberately, Peskov said. We hear a lot of bellicose statements.\n\nBiden's reassessment, first reported by Politico, had been in the works for several weeks. It's a byproduct, officials said, of Russia's new cross-border attack on Kharkiv, growing pressure from across Europe and a visit to kyiv this month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who reinforced the peril Ukraine faces after more than two years of war. war.\n\nUkraine has resisted Russian forces with increasing difficulty in recent months, while U.S. military aid virtually dried up last fall after congressional Republicans spoke out against additional aid. kyiv has faced dwindling stocks of ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles, to the point that diplomats in the Ukrainian capital began to worry this spring about a sudden collapse of the front lines and a possible defeat. Ukrainian major.\n\nThat changed after Congress approved the aid last month. But Ukrainian morale remains low and a lack of trained soldiers means the front lines remain vulnerable despite the resumption of US military assistance. Russia, meanwhile, took the opportunity to move toward Kharkiv and other parts of the long front line, attempting to exploit the window before more U.S. aid helps stabilize the troops from kyiv.\n\nUkrainian officials first requested permission from the White House weeks ago, on May 13, days after the assault on Kharkiv began and the day before Blinken arrived in kyiv, a another US official said. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. agreed to recommend a policy change in favor of Biden, said the manager.\n\nSullivan conveyed the recommendation to the president two days later, as Blinken was leaving kyiv, and Biden accepted it the same day, May 15, the official said. Blinken, meeting with Biden later in the week after his trip to Ukraine, agreed that the change made sense, the official said, adding that Biden had asked senior officials to work through details and risks before a final approval.\n\nBiden approved the change several days ago, and the policy took effect Thursday.\n\nBlinken, during a visit to Moldova this week, became the first senior Biden administration official to publicly indicate that Washington was considering a policy shift, telling reporters that as the battlefield has changed, it what Russia is doing has changed in terms of pursuing its goals. the aggression, the escalation, we have also adapted and adjusted.\n\nBlinken emerged from his trip to kyiv this month convinced that some form of limited policy change was necessary, officials said. At a closed-door meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague on Thursday, the top US diplomat hinted at an imminent policy change but did not provide details, one attendee said. When asked directly about it at one point, he smiled but remained silent, the person said.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a recent interview with The Economist that now is the time for allies to rethink their restrictions. Especially now, when many battles are taking place in Kharkiv, near the border, to deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory, it is very difficult for it to defend itself.\n\nSince then, allies like France, the Netherlands, Canada and Finland have echoed this sentiment.\n\nDuring a visit to kyiv this month, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine had the right to use weapons supplied by London to strike targets in Russia. Just as Russia strikes inside Ukraine, you can completely understand why Ukraine feels the need to look after its own defense.\n\nAlthough Moscow claims that five regions of Ukraine, including Crimea, are Russian territory, it is sensitive to growing calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike military targets in Russia itself. . Putin warned earlier this week that this could lead to serious consequences.\n\nIn a sign of the Kremlin's concern, Putin suggested that Russia could resort to nuclear strikes against small European countries if NATO allowed Ukraine to attack what he called deep within Russian territory. He warned that NATO officials should be fully aware of the stakes.\n\nIf Europe were to face these serious consequences, what would the United States do, given our parity in strategic arms? It's hard to say, he said, referring to U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. Are they looking for global conflict?\n\nUnder pressure from kyiv and its European allies, Biden's risk appetite changed several times during the war when he decided to expand Ukraine's arsenal with Stinger missiles, HIMARS launchers, advanced missile defense systems, drones, helicopters, M1 Abrams tanks and fighter jets.\n\nFacing restrictions on U.S. support for cross-border attacks, Ukraine is using its own long-range attack drones to strike Russian civilian and military targets. But these planes have payload limits and are not as efficient.\n\nU.S. officials remain concerned about Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian territory, including targeting oil refineries and nuclear warning systems, fearing they could dangerously destabilize Moscow. Washington has expressed concerns to kyiv over two attempted attacks last week against radar stations that provide conventional air defense as well as warning of nuclear launches by the West. At least one strike in Armavir, in Russia's Krasnodar region, appears to have caused damage.\n\nRussia's progress has also sparked discussions among allies about sending military instructors to Ukraine, a move long seen as potentially leading to escalation. But battlefield conditions appear to have convinced some allies that it makes sense to move training closer to Ukrainian troops, allowing them to move more quickly and easily to the front line.\n\nIn February, French President Emmanuel Macron surprised many by suggesting that nothing should be ruled out regarding sending trainers to Ukraine, but he did not provide concrete details.\n\nUkraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrsky, announced this week that Ukraine and France had signed a deal allowing French soldiers to train troops on Ukrainian soil, then quickly backtracked on the deal, saying that the matter was still under discussion.\n\nBut French officials did not deny that talks were moving forward, suggesting an announcement about some sort of training mission could be coming soon.\n\nAny training, NATO diplomats stressed, would be organized bilaterally between member states and Ukraine, not by NATO itself, which has kept its official distance from the war.\n\nBiden has long ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine. It remains to be seen whether this ban will be left aside, like its other red lines.\n\nHudson and Rauhala reported from Prague.

A number of European leaders, including the secretary-general of NATO, have also called for the restrictions on Western weapons be reconsidered.\n\nAt a White House briefing on Tuesday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby was asked about Zelenskyy's request, and he said there had been no change in policy.\n\n\"We're aware of the interest that President Zelenskyy has expressed in this regard. I would tell you that there's no change to our policy at this point. We don't encourage or enable the use of U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia,\" he said.\n\nKirby added at the time: \"I would note that the -- that the -- the Ukrainians have in the past defeated imminent air attacks, such as some of the ones that have occurred in the last few days, on their own since the war began.

However, Stoltenberg said at a session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly that there should be no NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine because otherwise, it would be difficult to keep the bloc out of the conflict.\n\nWestern countries sending their weapons to Ukraine are divided about limitations on its use. According to Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder, the United States is against using US-made weapons outside Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly stressed that he objects to supplying Kiev with long-range Taurus cruise missiles because this would imply sending German troops to that country to control their use. This, in his words, is a red line he is reluctant to cross.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times reported, citing its sources, that after his recent visit to Kiev US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he planned to suggest that President Joe Biden lift the ban on using American weapons against targets in Russia.\n\nOn May 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that when speaking about strikes inside Russia, representatives of NATO countries, \"should be aware of what they are playing with.\" According to Putin, Russia is closely monitoring such a discussion.

These have been numerous. Initially, tanks were not provided, then planes, and later long-range missiles. Additionally, there have been restrictions on using these weapons on Russian territory.\n\nRetired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, former commander of US Army Europe, has repeatedly criticized US political leadership for imposing various limitations on themselves, which have encouraged Putin to continue the war. These restrictions have been abandoned one by one, but at the cost of time and Ukrainian defenders' lives.\n\nWestern leaders have imposed these restrictions on themselves, out of fear of escalating the conflict, more precisely, out of fear of Russia's nuclear threats, which its leadership has brandished at every opportunity. However, it is essential to remember that the situation cannot escalate further - Russia, driven by imperialist ambitions, has attacked Ukraine and has not set any limits on itself when it comes to attacking civilian infrastructure or the use of weapons prohibited by international conventions.\n\nWestern countries must allow Ukraine to strike military targets in Russia with the weapons provided to them.\n\nThe only limitation has been the use of nuclear weapons. As Ben Hodges has said, nuclear weapons work best as a deterrent: if they exist but are not used. It seems that Russia has indeed managed to deter the West with nuclear threats, delaying immediate and unlimited military aid. However, the use of nuclear weapons - even limited tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine - would not benefit Russia.\n\nFirstly, it would not be well-received by the otherwise supportive Chinese, for whom a nuclear strike is a crucial red line. Secondly, the wind could carry radioactive contamination onto Russian troops or even into Russian territory, leaving a devastated land of little use to the invaders. Moreover, there is no doubt that a nuclear attack by Russia on Ukraine would not break the Ukrainians' will to defend, as they have nothing left to lose. Third, it is rumored that the United States has promised a devastating conventional strike on the source of any Russian nuclear attack.\n\nThis is where we get to the heart of the matter. Western countries must allow Ukraine to strike military targets in Russia with the weapons provided to them. This is especially a problem for the Kharkiv region, which is close to the Russian border. Russia fires from its territory with all its artillery, but, for example, Ukrainian-made self-propelled artillery cannot fire back into Russian territory if loaded with Western ammunition. Other sources of ammunition have largely been depleted.\n\nThis is an absurd restriction, and the sooner it is lifted, the better. Sweden has already allowed Ukraine to strike military targets in Russia with their weapons, and now France has also given its permission. If the United States permitted Ukraine to attack Russian bases with the long-range missiles it has provided, it would bring the end of the war closer.\n\nCommentsCopy", "source": {"uri": "news.postimees.ee", "dataType": "news", "title": "Estonian news - news.postimees.ee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hodges", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Hodges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imperialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radioactive contamination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-propelled_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-propelled artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://f7.pmo.ee/A0vSwf0vMgZ0fWs7BgNuzJ0sFvI=/1200x630/filters:focal(312x78:890x530):format(webp)/nginx/o/2024/05/31/16110981t1hc55d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612325", "eventUri": "eng-9612325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Blinken, speaking in Moldova, emphasized the evolving U.S. policy in response to changing battlefield conditions.\n\nCalls for a policy shift have grown, with leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg supporting Ukraine's right to strike inside Russia for self-defense.

Brown Jr. agreed to recommend a policy shift to Biden, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\"Sullivan took the recommendation to the president two days later, as Blinken was departing Kyiv, and Biden agreed to it that same day, May 15,\" according to the report, which cited an unnamed administration official. \"Blinken, meeting Biden later that week after his Ukraine trip, agreed that the shift made sense, the official said, adding that Biden asked for top officials to work through the details and the risks before a final approval.\"\n\nBiden reportedly signed off on the new policy a few days ago, and it went into effect yesterday. In recent days, Blinken and other administration officials hinted the change was coming. \"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too,\" Blinken said earlier this week in Moldova. \"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nGood Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre's Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Stacey Dec.

KOREA MISSILE LAUNCHES 'UNDERMINE STABILITY AND SECURITY': The U.S. continues to condemn North Korea's missile launches in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and Pyongyang continues to ignore those protests.\n\nThe latest protest from the State Department comes after launches on May 27 and May 29, including a failed effort to put a spy satellite in orbit. \"These launches continue the DPRK's reckless behavior, which poses a grave threat to the Korean Peninsula, the region, and international peace and security and undermine the global non-proliferation regime,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.\n\n\"We will continue to work closely with the international community to disrupt the DPRK's illicit revenue generation, which supports its UNSCR-prohibited weapons programs through the exploitation of overseas workers and malicious cyber activities,\" he added.\n\nNEW MUNITIONS FACTORY CHURNING OUT ARTILLERY SHELLS: The Pentagon is touting a new state-of-the-art munitions factory in Mesquite, Texas, that it said will dramatically increase the production of 155 mm artillery shells, which are being consumed at a prodigious rate in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are building new production lines across the country, and we are expanding our contracts with existing production facilities to increase their production speed and capacity,\" Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said at an opening ceremony for the Universal Artillery Projectile Lines facility.\n\n\"This facility, which will be operated by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, will help the Army meet its modernization goals by incorporating high levels of automation, modern manufacturing practices, and digital data capturability,\" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, said at yesterday's briefing. \"These efforts will significantly strengthen U.S. munition production capabilities and will serve as a credible deterrent to adversaries. This new facility underscores the Army and industry's commitment to bolstering the defense industrial base and maintaining the readiness of our armed forces.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden greenlights Ukraine to use US weapons to hit targets in Russia\n\nWashington Examiner: US confirms Russia used North Korean ballistic missiles in Ukraine\n\nWashington Examiner: Israel seizes Philadelphi Corridor: What is it and why is it significant?\n\nWashington Examiner: In 'punishment drills,' China stages dress rehearsal of military assault on Taiwan\n\nWashington Examiner: Mexican mayoral candidate assassinated while greeting supporters at rally\n\nMilitary.com: Unprotected: Troops Spent Decades Elbow-Deep in Dangerous Chemicals to Keep Nuclear Missiles Working\n\nWashington Post: As Ukraine Stumbles In War, Kyiv And Western Powers Struggle To Coordinate\n\nReuters: Hamas Says It Is Ready For A 'Complete Agreement' If Israel Stops War\n\nNew York Times: Egypt Faces Hard Choices After Israeli Seizure Of Gaza's Southern Border\n\nAP: U.S. And Britain Strike Houthi Rebel Targets In Yemen After Surge In Shipping Attacks\n\nAP: Ship Attacked By Yemen's Houthi Rebels Was Full Of Grain Bound For Iran, The Group's Main Benefactor\n\nBloomberg: U.S.-China Defense Chiefs Praise Talks Despite Continuing Tensions\n\nReuters: China's Defense Ministry Condemns U.S. Missile Deployment In Philippines\n\nWall Street Journal: How America Inadvertently Created an 'Axis of Evasion' Led by China\n\nDefense News: Behind the Scenes of the Pentagon's Race to Aid in Taiwan's Defense\n\nAP: US Military Defends Africa Strategy in Light of Coups and a Drift Toward Russia\n\nBreaking Defense: U.S. Marines Buy 200 Tactical Robots From Israel's Roboteam Amid All-Time High Demand: CEO\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: VP at USAFA Graduation: 'Our Adversaries Fear America's Dominance in the Air'\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Is a Cyber Force Next?

A number of European leaders, including NATO's secretary general, have also called for reconsidering restrictions on Western weapons.\n\nAt a White House press briefing Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was asked about Zelensky's request and said there had been no policy change.\n\nWe are aware of the interest expressed by President Zelensky in this regard.

But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\"\n\nAfter almost two days of deliberations, jury finds Trump guilt on all felony charges\n\nAbout six weeks after Donald Trump first arrived in a New York City courthouse to face felony charges of falsifying business records to pay \"hush money\" to conceal his sexual relations with pornographic-film star Stormy Daniels, in order to illegally influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential elections, the disgraced former US president, oft-bankrupt real estate magnate and former reality TV star was found guilty on all 34 counts.\n\nThe sentencing for Trump has been scheduled for for July 11 at 10 am New York time.\n\nThe US Constitution does not prevent a convicted felon from running for federal office, and Trump remains the presumed Republican candidate in the the 2024 presidential elections. But this would be the first time this has happened.\n\nIn 2016, Trump attempted to coerce Ukrainian leadership into providing damaging information on his 2020 presidential-election rival, Joe Biden. In order to obtain his goal, Trump blocked payment of a congressionally mandated military aid package to put pressure on Zelensky. Some of Trump's associates later were convicted on criminal charges for that illegal scheme, but the former president was never charged.\n\nAt a fundraiser earlier this month, Trump suggested he would have bombed Moscow and Beijing in order to advance US policy initiatives, and has recently reversed course in his pledges for financial support for Ukraine although he has insisted that Europe must do more than the US in terms of funding.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_moretti@kyivpost.com", "name": "John Moretti", "type":

Regional officials reported that nearly 200 people were inside the Epicenter hypermarket when the strike occurred, injuring 48 individuals.\n\nBlinken And Allies Already Signaled Policy Adjustment, Putin Sends Ultimatum As reported earlier by the Washington Post, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during a visit to Moldova, suggested that Washington might revise its stance, potentially allowing Ukraine to use longer-range ATACMS missiles and other U.S. weapons to target positions inside Russia.\n\nBlinken emphasized the need for the U.S. to \"adapt and adjust\" its military support in response to the evolving conditions on the battlefield, stating, \"We're going to make sure that Ukraine has the equipment it needs.\"\n\nAhead of a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, where the U.S. is anticipated to face calls to relax its restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky also noted progress towards an agreement on allowing strikes into Russian territory.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, in an interview with the Economist, stressed the importance of reconsidering current restrictions. He noted that denying Ukraine the capability to strike legitimate military targets on Russian soil, especially with intense fighting near Kharkiv, hampers their defense efforts.\n\nIn response, the Russian media outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets highlighted President Vladimir Putin's stern warning to the West, describing any Ukrainian use of long-range missiles as evidence of NATO's direct involvement in the conflict.\n\nIn contrast, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE:ITA) saw a 0.9% increase, outperforming the broader market, with defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp.

And continued restrictions on Ukraine's ability to strike targets elsewhere in Russia hinder Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression.\n\nAccording to experts, Russia still enjoys some sanctuary in which the Russian military can shield military forces before they get close enough to Kharkiv, or enter other parts of Ukraine. Moscow will continue to benefit from any partial sanctuary so long as Western states continue to impose restrictions on Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\n\n\"ISW continues to assess that the US should allow Ukraine to strike all legitimate military targets in Russia's operational and deep rear with US-provided weapons,\" the report says.\n\nAs reported by Ukrinform, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson expressed the position that Ukraine should decide for itself how to wage war, in particular, not to restrict the Armed Forces from attacking targets inside Russian territory with U.S.-provided weapons.\n\nEarlier, a bipartisan group of congressional representatives, members of the U.S. House of Representatives' Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, called

Two US officials confirmed that the US has lifted the restrictions, after officials from the White House, the US military and the State Department spent weeks discussing Ukraine's usage of the weapons behind closed doors.\n\nUkraine will only be allowed to use the weapons to defend the northeastern Kharkiv region, which is currently bearing witness to a drawn-out brawl for control of the region.\n\nRussia was furious at the news of the US' decision, launching strikes on the city of Kharkiv, the second-largest in Ukraine, that killed three people and wounded 23 others, including two children. The US, along with the rest of the West, has largely resisted Ukraine's pleas to be given permission to use Western missiles on Russian targets, anxious that this would draw NATO too close to the conflict.\n\nBut ahead of a NATO meeting in Prague on Thursday, the bloc's chief Jens Stoltenberg had said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider limits on strikes inside Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron had also insisted this week that Ukraine be allowed to 'neutralise' bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cool to the idea, though his country did promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500million euros (\u00a3426million) on Thursday.\n\nAs the West further deliberates the matter, Kharkiv police warned that residents could still be trapped underneath the rubble of buildings downed by the strikes. 'A man and a woman were killed as a result of an enemy munition hitting a multi-storey residential building... The fourth and fifth floors of one of the building's sections were completely destroyed,' police said in a statement, adding that another munition killed a guard at a civilian production facility.\n\nRegional Governor Oleg Synegubov noted in a Telegram post that an emergency medic was among the wounded, adding: 'The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot.' Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said there had not been 'a single military person, not a single military object' present.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv is located just across the border from Russia's Belgorod and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles. Russian strikes that hit a hardware superstore in the city last weekend killed 16 people.\n\nOn the other side of the border, in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, an oil depot was damaged in an aerial attack, its governor said Friday morning, noting that a major drone incursion elsewhere in the region had been repelled by air defences.\n\n'The situation is more serious in Temryuk district - the oil depot infrastructure there was damaged by an air strike. Three tanks with petroleum products were damaged and are on fire,' Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram, adding some workers had been wounded.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

However, Biden has for now maintained the ban on strikes deeper into Russian territory.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkov so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" the official said.\n\nAccording to Politico, this decision was \"secretly\" communicated to Kiev some time before its official confirmation.\n\nIn practice, Biden's direction will allow Ukrainian forces to use long-range American weapons - but not the ATACMS missiles quietly being shipped to Kiev since early April - to attack a band of Russian territory bordering Kharkov Region, where Russia recently seized dozens of towns and villages.\n\nUkraine had previously used these towns and villages to launch artillery, drone, and missile strikes on the same Russian territory covered by Biden's directive. However, Russia's push into Kharkov Region forced the Ukrainian military to abandon these staging grounds, ensuring that it could no longer strike targets in Belgorod and other Russian settlements near the border.\n\nThe US official who spoke to Politico claimed that Biden's decision \"has not changed\" the US' prohibition on strikes deep inside Russian territory. Biden has come under pressure to allow Ukraine unrestricted use of American weaponry against Russia in recent weeks, but - publicly at least - still refuses to grant this permission.\n\nThis public refusal has caused rifts within the Biden administration, and between the US and its allies. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior Pentagon officials both want Biden to approve long-range strikes on Russia, according to the New York Times and Politico, while several NATO countries including Britain, France, and Germany, have already given Ukraine permission to use their weapons as it sees fit.\n\nIn Kiev, Biden's refusal has reportedly angered Vladimir Zelensky and his senior officials, some of whom told the Washington Post this week that they could have held back Russia's Kharkov offensive if they had permission to conduct cross-border strikes on Russian equipment and troop formations.\n\nMoscow has dismissed the debate over such strikes in Western capitals. \"American weapons are already being used against various targets outside the combat zone,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters last week. \"We proceed from the fact that American and other Western weaponry strikes targets on the territory of Russia, primarily civilian infrastructure and residential areas.\"\n\nOne day before Lavrov spoke, Ukrainian forces used ATACMS missiles to kill two civilians in a strike on Crimea. The US does not consider Crimea to be Russian territory, and therefore does not forbid Ukraine from carrying out such strikes.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Such talk in the West reflects desperation and realization that they will not achieve their goals by the \"usual honest means,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.\n\nThe Biden administration is edging closer to lifting restrictions on Ukraine striking Russian territory with US-supplied weapons, Politico reported.\n\nThe issue is purportedly \"under consideration\" as Russia advances on the battlefield, leaving Ukraine's Armed Forces facing manpower and hardware losses.\n\nNo final decision has been made, the publication cited administration officials as saying, which explains why both US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby have been insisting that no such authorization has yet been given. Chances are that the Biden administration will continue to restrict the Kiev regime's ability to strike Russian targets, the report added.\n\nAny possible rethink of the US policy would come amid growing pressure from the Democrats, allies, and Kiev, the publication stated. Ukraine has been complaining that the US restrictions \"significantly reduce the effectiveness of partners' assistance and neutralize the efforts made,\" as per an internal document obtained by Politico.\n\nA succession of other outlets have also reported that the White House was mulling reversing its ban.\n\nBiden's national security aides are in a \"very brisk process\" to make a \"formal recommendation\" to the president regarding the risk such a policy change would entail, The New York Times said.\n\nSome unnamed advisors claimed a reversal of Biden's position was \"inevitable,\" albeit with caveats. Kiev would likely have to limit strikes to military targets just inside Russia's borders. The ban on using US weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory, or at critical infrastructure, would probably remain, the outlet said.\n\nMeanwhile, the US is concerned over recent Ukrainian attempts to carry out drone strikes \"against Russia's ballistic missile early-warning sites,\" The Washington Post cited an American official as saying.\n\nThese sites are \"sensitive locations because Russia could perceive that its strategic deterrent capabilities are being targeted, which could undermine Russia's ability to maintain nuclear deterrence against the United States,\" the official said, adding that Washington has conveyed its concerns to Kiev.\n\nIn public, US officials like Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Council spokesman John Kirby have maintained a degree of ambiguity, claiming that there have not been any changes in the policy. The US has not encouraged Kiev to strike outside of Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Moldova on Wednesday, adding that Ukraine has to make its own decisions. He also said that the Biden administration's approach toward the Ukraine conflict \"has been to adapt as the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed.\"\n\n\"We've adapted and adjusted, too, and we'll continue to do that,\" he said.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby also stated that there's \"no change\" in the current policy that says Ukraine cannot use US-supplied weapons to strike inside Russian territory.\n\nWestern powers have been split on the issue of untying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's hands and letting the Kiev regime strike deep into Russia. Last week, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged the bloc's members who have supplied weapons to Ukraine to stop barring Kiev from using these weapons to attack Russia. He was supported by hawkish officials like Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, and Estonia's Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur, but there has been pushback against the idea as well. Italy's government has called for efforts to \"work for peace and lower the tone.\"\n\nOn the home front, the Biden administration is also under pressure. Sixty former US officials and scholars sent a letter to President Joe Biden on Wednesday demanding that he lift the existing restrictions amid the deteriorating situation on the battlefield for Ukrainian forces in the Kharkov region. The signatories included former US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker, former US Army Europe Commanding General Ben Hodges, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe Philip Breedlove, and former US ambassadors to Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIf the Biden administration were to flip-flop on the matter of the ban, it would hardly be a \"first.\" Suffice it to recall how the administration changed its tune on other Ukraine policies, namely sending depleted uranium ammunition, cluster bombs, and long-range missiles. The discreet delivery of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles to Ukraine in March was confirmed by a Defense Department spokesperson to Sputnik last month.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory using Western-supplied military hardware could lead to direct conflict with NATO. In response to the debate on the issue from Washington and its NATO allies, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the US-led military bloc was toying with military rhetoric, raising the degree of escalation and plunging into what he called a warlike \"ecstasy.\"\n\n\"As I understand it, these conversations reflect, in a sense, desperation and a realization that by the usual honest means that apply in international law even in times of hostilities, they will not achieve their goal. It feels like agony,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian media.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kyiv has pleaded for an acceleration of deliveries of ammunition and also has asked to be allowed to use longer-range weapons -- which came with restrictions on their usage into Russian territory -- to their full extent.\n\n\"Allies are delivering many different types of military support to Ukraine and some of them have imposed some restrictions on the use of these weapons.... These are national decisions,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech delivered in Prague.\n\n\"But I think that in light of how this war has evolved...the time has come to consider some of these restrictions, to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves.\"\n\nLatvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze told RFE/RL in an interview that Latvia has never imposed limitations on any of the weapons it has supplied to Ukraine and that Riga supports Ukraine's right to use weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory.\n\nShe emphasized that Kyiv needs a variety of weapons and should receive them from its allies more consistently, adding that there are \"things that are being supplied without being spoken about publicly.\"\n\nBlinken, who arrived in Prague after a trip to Moldova, immediately held talks with his Czech counterpart, Jan Liptovsky, on the issue of combating Russian disinformation as Moscow tries to drive a wedge between allies supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat called Moscow's use of misinformation and disinformation \"poison\" and signed an agreement with the Czechs to combat it.\n\nBlinken also visited a Czech military base, where armored vehicles that Prague is sending to Kyiv were on display, and was informed about Prague's drive to supply Ukraine with 1 million rounds of ammunition by the end of the year.\n\n\"We know that a major front in the competition that we have, the adversarial relationship that we have, notably with Russia, is on the information front,\" Blinken said.\n\nDuring the ministers' meeting, talks are scheduled on a plan presented by Stoltenberg in April on a framework that would transfer responsibility for military and civilian aid for Ukraine from an informal, U.S.-led group to the formal structures of the alliance.\n\nNATO is currently not officially offering lethal military supplies to Kyiv. Individual NATO member states have been channeling supplies through the Ukraine Contact Group (UCG), an initiative chaired by the United States known informally as the Ramstein Group.\n\nThe ministers are also likely debate whether to allow Kyiv to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets inside Russia. The United States and Germany have been opposed to allowing such a move, while Britain and France have been in favor.\n\nStoltenberg and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, have also voiced their approval of allowing Ukraine to use Western arms to hit military objectives on Russian territory under certain conditions.\n\nAs the two-day informal meeting of the alliance is set to kick off in Prague, Russia launched a large-scale attack early on May 30 that targeted military and civilian infrastructure in nine Ukrainian regions, causing casualties and damage.\n\nIn the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Russian missiles struck two locations, wounding seven people, six of them women, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov reported.\n\n\"A two-story administrative building was hit, resulting in partial destruction, followed by a fire. Six women and one man received minor injuries,\" Synyehubov said.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is located just 35 kilometers from the Russian border and has been repeatedly pounded by Moscow's artillery and air strikes over the past several weeks as Ukraine's depleted air defenses and ammunition face increasing difficulties in repelling such attacks.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov earlier said critical infrastructure, including a gas pipeline, was damaged in the strikes, which also triggered a fire.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian Air Force said it shot down all 32 drones and seven of the 19 cruise missiles launched by Russia.\n\nThe missiles and drones were shot down over the Khmelnytskiy, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa, Kherson, Kyiv, and Vinnytsya regions, it said.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) said its naval drones sank two Russian \"Tunets\" boats in Crimea.\n\n\"On May 30, HUR's special unit Group 13, with the help of Ukrainian Magura V5 maritime attack drones, once again successfully attacked the ship depot of the aggressor state of Russia in the temporarily occupied Crimea,\" HUR said in a statement, adding that Russian troops used several attack helicopters in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the attack.\n\nThe Tunets is an 8.8-meter-long and 2.5-meter-wide diesel boat mainly used by Russian border guards.\n\nCopyright (c) 2024.

Western arms in Russia", "body": "PRAGUE: NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg pushed at the start of a meeting of the alliance\u00b4s foreign ministers on Thursday to let Ukraine use Western weapons to strike inside Russia, a move sought by Kyiv but opposed for now by its chief backer Washington.\n\nThe two-day meeting in Prague is meant to focus on efforts to hammer out a package of support for Ukraine at Nato\u00b4s summit in Washington in July.\n\nBut the swirling debate over whether to let Kyiv use arms sent by Western backers to strike inside Russia risks overshadowing the talks.\n\nUkraine has been pressing its supporters, led by the United States, to allow it to use the longer-range weaponry they supply to hit targets on Russian soil.\n\nSome countries including Britain and the Netherlands say Kyiv has the right to use their weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\n\nNorway\u00b4s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide added his support on Thursday, telling NRK television that Kyiv should not have to fight \"with one hand tied behind its back\".\n\nBut the United States and Germany have long opposed allowing Kyiv to strike over the border, out of fear it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow.\n\n\"The last weeks and months, most of the heavy fighting has taken place actually along the border between Russia and Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said ahead of the opening dinner with ministers.\n\n\"Therefore I believe that time has come to reconsider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralise\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less committal, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the White House said it still opposed Ukraine using US arms to strike inside Russia, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted that strategy could change.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has warned there would be \"serious consequences\" if Western countries gave approval to Ukraine.\n\n\"Nato member states, the United States, and capitals in Europe in recent days and weeks have been entering a new round of escalations in tensions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.\n\nThose pressing for Ukraine to be given a freer rein say they hope momentum is building for Washington and others to change course as Kyiv struggles to stop Russia\u00b4s offensive in the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"I understand the concerns, I understand that there are weapon systems which can be used quite far away,\" Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said.\n\n\"But I feel that we are even moving on that in the international sphere.\"\n\nAs Nato allies wrestle with that issue, ministers in Prague are also trying to come up with a support package that keeps Ukraine satisfied as its eventual membership in the alliance remain a distant prospect.\n\nAfter pressing hard at a summit last year, Kyiv has been told firmly by Nato countries -- led by the United States and Germany -- that it should not expect any concrete progress toward joining the alliance in Washington.\n\nStoltenberg instead wants to get alliance members to make clear, multi-year commitments on how much aid they\u00b4ll give to Ukraine in the future.\n\nLast month he floated an overall target figure of 100 billion euros ($108 billion) over five years, but that fell flat among allies confused over what it would involve.\n\nDiplomats say debate is ongoing as allies try to work out what any pledges would cover and how they might be structured.", "source": {"uri":

Having worked there for many years, he speaks Ukrainian fluently and is well-known for his candid, non-diplomatic statements. Currently, he holds an official role in the Czech government as a Special Representative for the Eastern Partnership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWe met in Prague, where NATO foreign ministers are negotiating. The issue of Ukraine is at the forefront of their discussions. Czechia is using every opportunity to influence these negotiations, explaining to others that the ban on striking military targets in Russia should be lifted. As it turns out, Czechia did not impose such restrictions on Kyiv from the beginning of its arms supplies in 2022.\n\nThe key topic in Ukraine is the approval of striking Russia with Western weapons. This week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal publicly thanked Czechia for its support after negotiations in Prague. Could you make the Czech position clear?\n\nCzechia is very consistent in its support for Ukraine. We understand perfectly that without some things, defence against Russian aggression is impossible. In particular, it is impossible without the weapons supplied by Western countries.\n\nWe also uphold your right to self-defence.\n\nMilitary targets or clusters of military force and human force on Russian territory are legitimate targets for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Because these Russian troops are there to continue illegal aggression against Ukraine from there. So striking them is self-defence, which is allowed for Ukraine by international law.\n\nSo Ukraine is only doing what is guaranteed by international law.\n\nNot striking military targets in Russia is like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\n\nSo we understand that this greatly complicates Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression.\n\nDoes Czechia believe that Ukraine can and will win the war?\n\nYes, I believe in it. But if we talk not about Czechia, but more broadly about Europe, we can often see a pessimism that I do not share.\n\nMoods in Europe are changing greatly. Last year, there was great euphoria here, expecting a counteroffensive. But when the counteroffensive turned out to be what it was, these moods shifted to pessimism.\n\nBut personally, I know Ukrainians well, I know Ukraine, and I understand that Ukrainians will not let themselves be defeated. But for that to happen, we must give the Armed Forces of Ukraine the maximum tools and opportunities for defence.\n\nNow we have a situation where neither the aggressor nor the victim has enough strength to defeat the other. But there is an important difference between them. Ukraine is fighting a holy war, a war for independence, which gives it a moral advantage. And we cannot say that about the Russian army or Russian society.\n\nBesides, I believe that Russia is a very fragile structure that can be easily broken.\n\nTherefore, it seems to me that at some point we will see a 'black swan' scenario for Russia. Then everything in Russia will come to an end.\n\nThis turning point can happen at any moment.\n\nThis is something that cannot be predicted or proven with rational arguments, but I believe it will happen. It must happen!\n\nThere is no doubt that you personally share the Ukrainian vision of victory. But now I am speaking not just with Ukraine's friend, David Stul\u00edk, but with an official representative of the Czech government. What is the government's position on Ukraine's victory?\n\nIt is very easy for me to answer, as the government's vision aligns with my personal view. Victory means the complete restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, including Crimea. Victory should also address the question \"what next\": we say, among other things, that Russia must compensate Ukraine for all damages.\n\nVictory must also answer the question of what should happen to Russia next. But here I will refrain from specifics. Although there are real thoughts on this matter, they have not yet been publicly voiced by Czech representatives. I will not \"set the tone.\" But this question cannot be avoided. And we often discuss this with colleagues from other EU countries - with those who are afraid of it (Russia's loss in the war - ed.). We try to convince them or at least show them different scenarios.\n\nIn any case, part of Ukraine's victory must include a decision on what to do with Russia next.\n\nIndeed, some countries are afraid. But why? And why do not all European states share the Czech and Ukrainian vision of our victory?\n\nFirstly, the psychological factor is very important. Secondly, there's Russian influence through hybrid operations and informational-psychological operations (IPSO).\n\nRussian agents in these countries can significantly influence public opinion and intimidate societies with what could happen if Ukraine won. It really frightens representatives of the political elite.\n\nPoliticians are afraid to enter what we call \"uncharted waters,\" an unpredictable situation. For many in Western Europe, it is associated with even worse military conflicts, with refugees.\n\nRussia skillfully convinces Europeans that if it loses, things will be even worse than now.\n\nBut we must not think like that.\n\nWe must not forget that Russia is our strategic opponent, who has challenged not only Ukraine but all of us. Therefore, there can be no compromise here, no \"meeting halfway.\"\n\nEither Russia wins, or Ukraine wins along with Western countries.\n\nIt is impossible to make concessions to Russia and at the same time believe that we have not lost.\n\nWhat could show us that the West has \"woken up\"? A permission to strike Russia, the deployment of troops to Ukraine, or closing the sky?\n\nYes, the \"red lines\" from the West are constantly shifting.\n\nRemember how many were frightened when Ukraine began striking Crimea? Then [Deputy Head of Russia's Security Council Dmitry] Medvedev and [Spokesman of Russian Defence Ministry Igor] Konashenkov were scaring us with stories of \"nuclear ashes,\" but nothing happened.\n\nThen, despite fears, tanks began to be supplied. Then, it was announced that the F-16s would be supplied.\n\nAnd now several EU and NATO countries, as well as the Alliance's Secretary-General, are talking about reconsidering other restrictions as well.\n\nI think that gradually we will also cross the 'red line' regarding strikes on military targets in Russia, which some NATO countries still adhere to - let me emphasise, not all.\n\nUnfortunately, these changes are happening slowly. Russia's nuclear blackmail still works. Certain countries fear a major war in Europe, and Russia uses this.\n\nBut the reality is different. In fact, no one wants a war. But in order to prevent an even greater war, the aggressor must be stopped, not encouraged with concessions.\n\nIs it possible to close the sky over Ukraine? I mean, for the Western aircraft to patrol the skies over Ukraine?\n\nThere are talks about shooting down 'illegal flying objects' - missiles and drones - from the territory of Ukraine's neighbouring states.\n\nThis issue is being discussed. There are still discussions about the consequences this might bear, but I can assure you that this discussion has never gone that far.\n\nThis decision is necessary right now, so of course, it's a pity that the discussion is taking time. Ukraine does not have this time, and its patience is much less. But Ukraine has to accept that its allies need to discuss all these issues. And the most important thing is that these discussions are on the right track now.\n\nI repeat, we are constantly pushing the 'red lines' further and further.\n\nAre there discussions about NATO fighters taking off from NATO countries' airports to patrol the sky over Ukraine?\n\nI have not heard of such discussions at the moment.\n\nThis is hindered, among other things, by the existing desire in the West to maintain unity, so that all NATO and EU countries speak with one voice. And this is not easy, as there are a few countries, which constantly express their disagreement and hinder reaching unanimity.\n\nThis is, unfortunately, part of the 'genetic code' of Western institutions.\n\nIn your opinion, is time on Ukraine's or Russia's side?\n\nFrom a macro perspective, time is definitely on Ukraine's side.\n\nRussia is a country that has no future. There is no economic model that would let modern Russia continue to exist in the future. Its economy is based on gas, oil or nuclear energy exports. These resources will eventually cease to work due to the transition to green energy.\n\nBut in the short term, unfortunately, time is against Ukraine. Ukraine is losing people, suffering increasing destruction. The destroyed can be rebuilt, although the costs will be colossal. But human lives cannot be restored at all.\n\nAnd Ukraine's approach here is different from Russia's, which also loses people but doesn't care about their deaths.\n\nHow can we convince our Western friends that Ukraine must not only win the war but also win as soon as possible?\n\nI believe it is very important to bring them to Ukraine. When representatives of other countries, MPs, see Kharkiv, see the front line, meet with the military and hear about what these people did before the war, what careers and lives they had, this human approach greatly changes the perspective and perception of the war.\n\nWestern representatives who have visited Ukraine perceive it differently than those who have never been there.\n\nPersonal experience, for example, an air raid alarm, helps [them] understand what people are going through - and not through their own fault, but because of Russia. This greatly changes attitudes and understanding.\n\nTo maintain its development prospects, Ukraine must join both NATO and the European Union. But a few countries (such as Hungary) do not want to see us in the EU. Can we override this?\n\nFor this to happen, Europe must remember that after World War II, the European community was created for peace, so that the European continent would never experience a war again. Now is a similar moment, and the same instruments are needed.\n\nIn addition, procedures need to be changed. Czechia supports Germany's proposal to abandon unanimity in making certain decisions on enlargement so that no country can veto every technical step.\n\nThis decision is truly revolutionary for Czechia.\n\nAfter all, we have always said and explained to our partners that it is important for our national interests that the EU maintains the principle of unanimity in foreign policy and that we are not ready to give up the veto.\n\nBut now, for the sake of accelerating Ukraine's accession to the EU, we are ready to deviate from our national positions. And this idea needs to be promoted in other countries. We cannot afford to miss the current historical opportunity.\n\nMoreover, Ukraine can only join the EU after fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, including those regarding human rights. Some parts of Ukrainian society fear that under the guise of respect for minority rights, we will be forced, for example, to 'love' Russians.\n\nThere is no requirement to love Russians in the criteria for EU accession.\n\nAs for the 'Russian minority,' we in the EU should not be legal fundamentalists. We need to consider Ukraine's circumstances. And I see that this is taken into account. For example, when the European Commission reviewed the law on minorities last year, there was an understanding that the issue of the Russian language is very sensitive for Ukraine.\n\nWe cannot have expectations from Ukraine to meet peacetime requirements. We understand how sensitive this issue is for Ukraine.\n\nJust as Jews could not immediately love Germans after WWII. There is a certain path to this.\n\nOf course, the history of European integration shows that reconciliation between countries that once waged wars - for example, between France and Germany - is possible.\n\nBut steps are needed first, especially from the aggressor.\n\nCzechia had a similar experience. You are an EU member, although you forcibly expelled Germans from Bohemia in the past.\n\nYes, two million Germans after WWII. It was a very sensitive issue when we were joining the EU.\n\nAfter all, certain circles in Germany wanted to annul the decrees of then-President [Edvard] Bene\u0161 on confiscating German property in Czechia.\n\nBut without understanding the historical context, this issue cannot be considered. And in the end, no one forced us to take any actions in this context. Because the EU does not practice legal fundamentalism, it does not require 100% compliance, without considering the circumstances. And Ukraine can count on this.\n\nIt will happen when the EU is ready to accept Ukraine and when Ukraine truly shows significant progress in reforms and a sincere desire to become a Union member.\n\nThere is also a connection between Ukraine's victory and EU membership. Primarily because after the victory, you will experience an economic boom - just as Western Europe did after WWII. The process of reconstruction will begin, which will further boost economic growth.\n\nIn this context, understanding that Ukraine will be economically strong will increase the EU's interest in Ukraine's membership because your accession will economically strengthen the EU itself.", "source": {"uri": "eurointegration.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title":

But the Administration declared that the weapons could only be used on Russia-occupied areas such as Crimea.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, amid a visit to Kyiv last week, proposed the removal of the restriction because of the Russian ground and aerial assault on Kharkiv.\n\nSee also Ukraine War, Day 820: Biden Administration Debates Permission For Kyiv To Use US Weapons Inside Russia\n\nThat position was bolstered by the calls of allies.

Six women and one man received minor injuries,\" Synyehubov said.\n\nTerekhov said critical infrastructure, including a gas pipeline, was damaged in the strikes, which also triggered a fire.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian Air Force said it shot down all 32 drones and seven of the 19 cruise missiles launched by Russia.\n\nUkraine also claimed naval drones destroyed two Russian \"Tunets\" boats in Crimea.\n\nThe Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) said in a statement that HUR's special unit Group 13, with the help of Ukrainian Magura V5 maritime attack drones, \"once again successfully attacked the ship depot of the aggressor state of Russia in the temporarily occupied Crimea.\"\n\nHUR said Russian troops used several attack helicopters to in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the attack. The Tunets is an 8.8-meter-long and 2.5-meter wide diesel boat mainly used by Russian border guards.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-kharkiv-attack- synyehubov-residential-building/32972968.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2024.

unnamed American officials, Politico reported on May 30 that President Joe Biden's administration had given the go-ahead for Kyiv to attack targets inside Russia but \"solely near the area of Kharkiv.\" The report was then confirmed by other outlets, including ABC News and the Associated Press (AP).\n\nNykyforov previously welcomed this move in an interview with The Guardian, published on May 31.\n\n\"It will significantly boost our ability to counter Russian attempts to mass across the border,\" Nykyforov told The Guardian in answer to the question about permission from the U.S. to strike on Russian soil.\n\nThe Biden administration's decision allows Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike Russian soldiers and command, as well as control centers, The Guardian said.\n\nThe Pentagon, in contrast, insisted on May 30 that there has been \"no change\" in policy regarding the use of U.S. arms without specifically mentioning attacks near Kharkiv Oblast.", "source": {"uri":

The go-ahead comes at a time when Ukraine is losing ground to the advancing forces of the Russian Federation and allied indigenous forces from Donbass (Donbas).\n\nKharkov is approximately 30 kilometers from the Russian Federation.\n\nAmerica maintains that the overall policy remains intact outside of this strategic region.\n\nThe BBC - citing a US government official - reports, \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of Army Tactical Missile System [ATACMS] or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed.\"\n\nHowever, the Russian Federation will view the change negatively and deem it threatening. Hence, it remains to be seen how political elites in Moscow will respond to this dangerous stage in the conflict.\n\nThe BBC says, \"Russian forces appear to have recently taken advantage of a window of opportunity to push deeper into Ukrainian territory in Kharkiv as Kyiv waits for further Western weapons to arrive at the front.\"\n\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy supports Ukraine. Yet, she doesn't currently seek to become entangled by the intrigues of America, France, the United Kingdom, and other ardent anti-Russian members within NATO.\n\nMeloni said, \"It is better to strengthen the ability to equip Ukraine with effective air defense systems ... This allows us to protect Ukraine's civilian population without the situation getting out of hand.\"\n\nDmitry Peskov (Kremlin Spokesperson) said, \"NATO member states, especially the United States, and other European capitals in recent days and weeks have entered a new round of escalating tension. They are doing this deliberately, we hear many belligerent statements. This is nothing more than provoking a new level of tension.\"\n\nReuters reports (informed by a government official), \"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them.\"\n\nThe Donbass (Donbas) environs and Novorossiya naturally tie in with the Russian Federation. However, the Soviet Union altered the borders dramatically under Communist rule to the detriment of Russians. Therefore, nationalism on both sides - Ukrainian and Russian - encouraged by NATO powers is witnessing a brutal war.\n\nIt is hoped that the Russian Federation and Ukraine will finally resolve the ongoing crisis rather than the conflict resulting in never-ending deaths.\n\nModern Tokyo News is part of the Modern Tokyo Times group\n\nhttp://moderntokyotimes.com Modern Tokyo Times - International

These high-profile events should also serve as a chance to take stock. With no end in sight to Russia's genocidal invasion, Kyiv's Western partners must define the endgame of their support for Ukraine. Is it Ukrainian victory or merely Ukrainian survival?\n\nWhy does the West not have a coherent victory plan? How long can Ukraine be expected to sustain the current war effort if the country only receives sufficient military aid to survive? Is the latest US aid package enough to secure Ukrainian victory? Is Europe doing enough to enforce sanctions, confiscate Russian assets, and supply advanced weapons systems like Taurus missiles? These are just some of the key questions Ukraine's partners should be asking themselves in the coming weeks.\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. Putin's Russia poses a direct threat to the global security system and to a sustainable peace in Europe. The outcome of Russia's war against Ukraine will define the future security framework on the European continent for decades to come. If the West provides Ukraine with the support it needs to win the war, this victory will secure peace not only for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe. Russian defeat could also spark a political transformation inside Russia and help undermine the country's aggressive imperial ambitions.\n\nThe consequences of Russian success in Ukraine would be equally far-reaching. If the West continues to demonstrate weakness in Ukraine and supports calls for some kind of ceasefire or negotiated settlement, Russia will claim an historic victory and will become even more internationally aggressive. This aggression will not be limited to Ukraine, and will be targeted against the whole Western world.\n\nNor will the Kremlin be acting alone. On the contrary, Russian victory over the West in Ukraine would embolden the Alliance of Autocracies that has emerged in recent years, bringing together Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. While further Russian aggression is likely to focus on Europe, Putin's fellow autocrats will be encouraged to embrace their own expansionist agendas elsewhere.\n\nThis is why the international community needs to accept that only Ukrainian victory can open the door to a sustainable peace, both for Ukraine and the wider world. Any attempt to reach a compromise peace agreement with Putin would not only hand Russia victory and allow Moscow to continue occupying entire regions of Ukraine; it would also be a dangerous repetition of the 1938 Munich Conference, which had such tragic consequences for the entire international community. The British and French leaders who agreed to hand Hitler part of Czechoslovakia in Munich also hoped they were securing peace. Instead, they were setting the stage for World War II. Europe cannot afford to make the same mistake again.\n\nAt present, the West appears to be split into two main camps over the issue of how to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine. One camp recognizes the importance of Ukrainian victory for European security, and sees Russian defeat as its clear goal. These countries are committed to supporting the Ukrainian war effort and refuse to rule out sending troops to defend Ukraine if necessary.\n\nThe other camp favors a negotiated settlement and typically frames this readiness to compromise with the Kremlin as a desire for peace. Such posturing is intellectually dishonest. After all, nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians themselves. However, Ukrainians understand that peace cannot be secured by offering territorial concessions to the Putin regime that would abandon millions of Ukrainians to the horrors of permanent Russian occupation. They know that accepting a ceasefire without victory would make it impossible to hold Russia accountable for war crimes.\n\nCrucially, Ukrainians also recognize that unless Putin is defeated, he will inevitably go further. Encouraged by the impunity of a ceasefire agreement, Russia would use any pause in hostilities to rearm and prepare for the next phase of its war against Ukraine and the West. This would create dangers similar to the threat faced by the Allies during World War II, when Churchill and Roosevelt warned against a premature peace and instead declared the goal of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender. Today's Western leaders must now recognize that offering Putin a ceasefire will not bring about a lasting peace. Instead, it will pave the way for more war.\n\nFuture Western support for Ukraine must be built around a clear and unambiguous commitment to Ukrainian victory. This is currently missing. When Western leaders and policymakers gather in the coming weeks, the need to work toward a Ukrainian victory should be at the very top of the agenda. Meanwhile, Ukrainians must continue to explain the difference between a temporary ceasefire and a lasting peace. In 2023, Ukrainian civil society experts did their part by developing their own vision, which was outlined in the Sustainable Peace Manifesto, describing the importance of bringing Russia to justice and providing Ukraine with unambiguous security guarantees.\n\nAfter more than ten years of Russian military aggression against Ukraine, it is time for Kyiv's partners to learn the lessons of this war and avoid falling into further Russian traps. When Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, it did so under a veil of deniability using so-called \"little green men,\" or Russian soldiers without insignia. A decade later, Russia is now openly waging the largest European invasion since World War II, and is supported by an alliance of fellow tyrannies who share the Kremlin's goal of destroying the rules-based international order. Russia is now attacking Ukraine with Iranian drones and North Korean missiles, while receiving military supplies and vital economic support from China. If the West is unable to counter this growing threat, it will forfeit its position at the heart of the international security architecture and be replaced by the rising authoritarian powers.\n\nIn 2014, Western leaders were naive enough to expect a diplomatic solution to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It should now be painfully obvious that such hopes were unrealistic. Between 2014 and 2022, Ukraine engaged in more than 200 rounds of negotiations with Russia, but this failed to prevent the full-scale invasion of February 2022.\n\nEven while talks continued, Russia made its genocidal intentions clear with relentless propaganda denying the existence of the Ukrainian nation and dehumanizing Ukrainians. This genocidal rhetoric has since been implemented in practice by Putin's invading army, with well-documented massacres in places like Bucha and Izium, mass abductions and forced deportations, and the eradication of all symbols of Ukrainian national identity in areas under Russian occupation. While the international community sees what is happening in Ukraine, most remain reluctant to accuse Russia of genocide as this would oblige them to act. But turning a blind eye cannot change the fact that we are witnessing a genocide in the center of twenty-first century Europe.\n\nEverybody understands what is needed for Ukraine victory. They know how much Western military assistance is required, and exactly which weapons should be delivered. Everybody knows what sanctions, tribunals, and security agreements are necessary in order to establish a sustainable peace. At the same time, the leaders of the democratic world have yet to address why they have so far shied away from policies that could facilitate Ukrainian victory. The answer is very simple: Western leaders are still heavily influenced by the twin fears of a possible Russian escalation and a potential Russian collapse. In other words, they are unable to commit fully to Ukrainian victory because they are afraid of Russian defeat. This is now the greatest single obstacle to a sustainable peace in Europe.\n\nPerhaps the best advice for Ukraine's Western partners comes from Pope John Paul II, who said \"be not afraid\" as he led the fight for freedom and democracy in Central Europe during the 1980s. Europe must now overcome its fears once again if it is to safeguard the freedoms that define the continent. Sustainable peace cannot be achieved at the expense of justice. European security will remain elusive if Putin is allowed to gain from his aggression and consolidate his genocidal occupation of Ukrainian lands.\n\nWith the Russian invasion now in its third year, Ukraine's partners must finally acknowledge that European security depends on Ukrainian victory. The sooner they develop and implement a strategy to achieve this victory, the more lives will be saved. Since 2022, Western policies of escalation management have failed to appease Putin and have only emboldened the Kremlin. If the West wants peace, it must help Ukraine win.\n\nHanna Hopko is co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory and head of the ANTS Network.

According to reports, these late-night strikes included an assault on the Staro Konstantinovsky shooting range, which inflicted substantial damage on NATO military instructors and Western equipment stationed there.\n\nIn addition, the Russian military launched a missile strike on a substation in the city of Konstantinov. The missile hit its mark, causing a loud explosion and knocking out power across the entire city.\n\nMoreover, the Russian forces targeted an airfield used by Ukraine to host F-16 fighter jets, as well as a warehouse storing US-made ATACMS tactical missiles, further intensifying the situation.\n\nThe Ukraine's bet\n\nUkraine has always dreamed of deploying F-16 fighter jets, but the Russian military has fiercely resisted this idea. Retired Russian Colonel Viktor Litovkin once warned that if Ukraine constructs airfields and support facilities for Western-supplied F-16s, the Russian military will target and destroy those facilities. He added that Russia would vigilantly wait until the construction is sufficiently advanced to launch its attacks.\n\nAware of this threat, Ukraine decided to take the risk. They invested substantial resources into building the necessary infrastructure -- airports, radar stations, pre-flight training, maintenance equipment, aviation fuel purification, and missile storage facilities. Now, as the Russian military follows through on its warnings, Ukraine faces significant peril and may see its bold gamble backfire.\n\nATACMS warehouse destroyed\n\nWhat's particularly concerning for Ukraine is that their U.S.-supplied ATACMS missile depot wasn't spared in recent attacks. These missiles had been instrumental in striking Russia's Type 22800 Tornado missile ship and taking out a range of Russian military equipment, including an S-300 launch vehicle, multiple S-400 launch vehicles, and several radars.\n\nThe Ukrainian military had strategic plans to leverage these ATACMS tactical missiles against Russian forces. However, within just a few days, their warehouse came under fire. According to reports from Chinese media outlet Sohu, the Russian army discovered the depot and launched two consecutive attacks.\n\nNow, there's a growing sense of bewilderment within the Ukrainian ranks, as they're left questioning how the Russian military's intelligence capabilities have seemingly improved overnight.\n\nThe use of commercial satellites\n\nAccording to recent analyses, it's believed that a commercial satellite company may have supplied high-resolution satellite images to the Russian military.\n\nModern commercial remote sensing satellites can easily provide images with a resolution better than one meter, making the entire battlefield appear almost like a 3D image. This technology allows the Russian army to gain a nearly comprehensive understanding of the entire battlefield situation.\n\nA nuclear weapon\n\nNATO has long expressed concerns that pressing Russia too hard could provoke Moscow into deploying its nuclear arsenal, a fear that is especially poignant among Western nations, including the United States.\n\nDespite their firm stance on reserving the right to use nuclear weapons in extreme situations, the Russian military has shown a preference for more cost-effective combat strategies. These currently include the use of mines and drones targeting Western tanks, and high-speed missiles aimed at airfields, supplemented by satellite intelligence.\n\nInstead of engaging the Ukrainian forces head-on, the Russian strategy leans towards launching decisive strikes on multiple smaller units of the Ukrainian army. This approach not only minimizes Russia's own casualties but also cuts operational costs, making it a highly favorable tactic for Moscow.\n\nA question no one asks\n\nUkraine is set to receive at least 75 operationally ready F-16 fighters from its allies, with some sources suggesting that this number could be even higher. These combat aircraft are expected to play a pivotal role in Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion. In fact, given Denmark's approval, F-16s might conduct strikes inside Russia.\n\nHowever there are lingering concerns about the arrival of these fighter jets in Ukraine. Imagine, for instance, that Russia has accurate intelligence on the locations of the newly constructed F-16 airstrips. Russia, known for its advanced space surveillance capabilities, might use this to its advantage.\n\nThis raises a critical question: where will the Ukrainian F-16s take off from if Russian strikes successfully destroy the under-construction airstrips? We've witnessed numerous \"red lines\" being crossed, particularly by nations supporting Ukraine. Tanks were once forbidden, as were long-range missiles, Western intelligence, fighter jets, and even the use of Western weapons against targets within Russia. All these barriers have been breached.\n\nThe next potential taboo could be allowing Ukrainian planes to take off from Romania, Poland, or the Baltic countries. If this happens, it might pave the way for the eventual deployment of Western ground combat units, further escalating the conflict. This scenario paints a portrait of a war where Western opposition to Russia continues to shatter previously held prohibitions, making peace seem like a distant concept.", "source": {"uri":

US officials think that first attacks on Russian soil using US weapons may begin in a matter of several hours or days, the New York Times (NYT) reported, citing sources.\n\nEarlier, the Pentagon confirmed that US President Joe Biden's administration had authorized Ukraine to conduct limited strikes inside Russia with American-made weapons. According to the newspaper, the decision came into effect on Thursday, May 30.\n\nThe news outlet noted that the decision to reconsider the policy track with regard to US weapons is related to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kiev in mid-May, however, talks between the Americans and Ukrainians on the issue were underway for weeks. In particular, on May 13, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown discussed this issue in a video conference format with their Ukrainian colleagues and \"decided to recommend to the president that he reverse his position.\" According to the NYT, Biden for the first time allowed for exceptions on May 15 and the final decision was made last week.\n\nThe newspaper noted that the leak to the media about the potential lifting of restrictions on the use of the US arms angered the Pentagon. \"The formal orders did not get conveyed to the Pentagon until earlier this week,\" the NYT added. However, only the close circle was aware of the change and at the May 30 briefing, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh continued to convince reporters that there had been no policy change.\n\nThe newspaper noted that, having allowed to use US arms for strikes on Russia, \"Biden has clearly crossed a red line that he himself drew.\" An anonymous senior US official told the NYT that the US president's \"restrictions could be subject to further loosening.\" \"This is a new reality,\" he said, \"and perhaps a new era\" in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAs Politico reported earlier, citing four anonymous sources, including two US officials, Biden secretly gave permission to use US-supplied weapons to deliver strikes on Russian soil. It was claimed that the permission applied to the Russian regions bordering the Kharkov Region.\n\nOn May 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that when speaking about strikes inside Russia, representatives of NATO countries, \"should be aware of what they are playing with.\" According to Putin, Russia is closely monitoring such a discussion. Once Ukraine's military uses long-range weapons, Moscow will once again have to decide on a \"buffer zone,\" Putin said.\n\nRussian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on his Telegram channel today that Moscow proceeded from the fact that all long-range weapons supplied to Ukraine were already \"directly operated by servicemen from NATO countries,\" which is tantamount to participation in the war against Russia and a reason to start combat operations.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

These attacks, combined with psychological operations intended to spread panic, demonstrate a clear strategy. One recent act of terrorism was the precision-guided bomb attack on Ukraine's Epicenter, a home improvement store filled with civilians, on Saturday morning (May 25) killing 19 so far. Propagandists quickly seized the news, attempting to frame the attack as a Ukrainian fabrication designed to manipulate the West into providing more arms, all against the backdrop of a relatively unsuccessful offensive on a small part of the Kharkiv-Belgorod border.\n\nLegitimate 1,100,000 Follower\n\n\"Zelensky's Yermak's authorities benefit from the tragedy in every sense, shifting the accents again to the side they favor.\"\n\n\"When Zelensky talks about madness, meanness and terror, you want to take him to a mirror and smash him into his own reflection.\"\n\nSheikh Tamir 433,000 followers\n\n\"Some speculate that this is Zelensky's handwriting to ask for permission to hit Russian territory with long-range missiles. If the West goes for it, the next level will be nuclear escalation.\"\n\nVerified:\n\nSince the US approved its military aid packages to Ukraine, the situation regarding the Armed Forces of Ukraine's (AFU) \"arms hunger\" has significantly improved. On May 17, President Zelensky stated for the first time this year that no unit had complained to him about a lack of artillery. This makes the narrative that Ukraine would resort to a false-flag operation, killing its own people to secure more weapons, completely unfounded.\n\nFirstly, Ukraine, unlike Russia, has demonstrated a strong commitment to the safety of its civilians throughout the whole period of the full-scale invasion. This is evidenced by Zelensky's persistent calls for the West to provide more air defense systems (as the name implies, primarily for protection) and operations to evacuate civilians from hot spots of the war.\n\nThis is confirmed by Zelensky's evening address post attack on Kharkiv -\n\n\"This strike on Kharkiv is just another manifestation of Russian insanity. [...] When we say to the leaders of the world that Ukraine needs enough air defense, when we say we need real resolve ... we're talking about how to prevent literally these strikes from happening,\"\n\nSecondly, unlike Russia, Ukraine has never inflicted death and destruction on its own citizens for political gain. In contrast, during his early years of ruling Russia, it is considered by the majority of experts that Putin ordered the destruction of apartment buildings in 1999, killing 300 of his own people, to consolidate power and justify the Second Chechen War. This difference in approaches further discredits any claims that Ukraine would engage in such acts for military assistance, no matter how much Ukraine needs it.\n\nFinally, apart from air defense systems, there is no other request from Ukraine for particular weapons at this time. Apart from more Patriot systems (which are on their way, albeit it slower than hoped), Ukraine currently possesses the necessary arms to conduct its operations, apart from F-16 jets (soon expected). The primary issues lie in the temp in which these systems are being provided and the restriction imposed by the US President on Ukraine's use of American-provided weapons, such as ATACMS, to target Russian bases involved in the attacks on Kharkiv.\n\nSheikh Tamir 433,000 followers\n\n\"Do professional photographers in bulletproof vests always stand under the Epicenter shopping center?\"\n\nKotsnews 572,000 followers\n\n\"Now Budanov has set the task to knock us out of the liberated territories of Kharkiv region at ANY cost.

The formula is simple. At night, some crates are brought in on military trucks to the epicenter. They do it in a showy fashion. The Russians pick it up and strike. It's a type of provocation. \"\n\nFRONT Notes 47,000 followers\n\nThe farm people [Ukrainians] are beating hysterically and spewing curses at the subject of a fly-by at a hypermarket in Kharkiv that detonates as if it were a warehouse with fireworks. At the same time, it has long been no secret that the premises was used as a warehouse of military equipment and weapons.\n\nVerified:\n\nA narrative disseminated by Russian propaganda channels was a continuation of the main theme of a \"Ukrainian False Flag\" operation. To create a false basis for Ukrainian skeptics abroad and the internal Russian audience to believe this narrative, propaganda used tactics such as questioning how photographers were in place at the time of the attack, using this as supposed evidence that Ukraine was behind it.\n\nPropaganda fails to mention that, since the start of the full-scale war, the number of journalists and photographers in the Kharkiv area has significantly increased to document and inform the West about Russia's terrorist attacks. As Russia escalated attacks on Kharkiv and launched a small offensive on Vovchansk, the number of journalists ready to cover these events also grew.\n\nMoreover, many foreign and Ukrainian journalists undergo training in Kharkiv to adapt and learn how to operate in a war zone. It provides a challenging environment under constant fire but is a degree safer than operating on the frontlines. And so, another reason journalists and photographers can arrive at the scene minutes after an attack is due to the significant number already working and learning in the city.", "source": {"uri":

Sanger has reported on superpower confrontations and strategy for three decades as a national security correspondent in Washington.\n\nPresident Biden is edging toward what may prove to be one of his most consequential decisions in the war for Ukraine: whether to reverse his ban on shooting American weapons into Russian territory.\n\nHe has long resisted authorizing Ukraine to use U.S. weapons inside Russia because of concern it could escalate into a direct American confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary.\n\nNow, after months of complaints about the restrictions from Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, the White House has begun a formal -- and apparently rapid -- reassessment of whether to take the risk. Approving further uses of U.S. weapons would give Kyiv a way to conduct counterattacks on artillery and missile sites that now enjoy something of a safe haven just inside Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, in Moldova, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken became the first administration official to publicly leave open the possibility that the Biden administration might \"adapt and adjust\" its stance about attacking inside Russia with American weapons, based on changing battlefield conditions.\n\n\"We're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself,\" Mr. Blinken said.\n\nHis statement was the latest amid a drumbeat of calls for a shift, from allies and from within Mr. Biden's administration. Mr. Blinken, who returned from a sobering trip to Kyiv earlier this month, reported to the president that the Ukrainians might not be able to hold the territory between Kharkiv and the Russian border unless Mr. Biden reversed himself.

They don't understand anything but force. We are not the first and not the last target,\" he said of Russia.\n\n\"I think it is absolutely illogical to have [western] weapons and see the murderers, terrorists, who are killing us from the Russian side. I think sometimes they are just laughing at this situation,\" he said. \"It's like going hunting for them. Hunting for people. They understand that we can see them, but we cannot reach them.\"\n\nZelenskiy also said:\n\nZelenskiy's remarks came as the Biden administration on Thursday relaxed its long-standing policy forbidding Ukraine from using US weapons against targets inside Russia. It gave permission for Ukraine to fire back - but only near Kharkiv, where Moscow has been waging a fresh offensive.\n\nThe decision allows Ukraine to use US-supplied Himars artillery to strike Russian soldiers and command and control centres - a development welcomed by Zelenskiy's press spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov.\n\nHe told the Guardian: \"It will significantly boost our ability to counter Russian attempts to mass across the border.\"\n\nBut the White House insisted its policy prohibiting deeper strikes had not changed. Ukraine would still not be able to use the long-range Atacms system within Russia, it clarified.\n\nSpeaking inside his presidential headquarters, Zelenskiy made clear he wanted to use long-range weapons such as the UK-made Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nHe said that, despite reports to the contrary, the UK has not given \"100% permission\" to do so. Thursday's shift is unlikely to change the position either.\n\nIn reality, Downing Street waits on the Americans, Zelenskiy suggested. \"We raised this issue twice. We did not get confirmation from him [David Cameron, the foreign secretary],\" he explained.\n\nA final decision by the UK and other partners depended on \"consensus\", with the position in Washington being crucial, he suggested. \"You know how it works,\" he said.\n\nBiden has long been concerned about the risks of a direct nuclear conflict with Moscow.\n\nThe US president is likely to skip a peace summit in Switzerland next month, which Zelenskiy has organised. Asked if he felt let down by the US and its leadership, he replied: \"I think they need to believe in us more.\"\n\nTen countries had indicated support for the scrapping of \"red lines\". The French president, Emmanuel Macron, indicated his backing on Wednesday, saying Ukraine could use long-range French Scalp missiles against hostile Russian military sites.\n\nIn the past week Russia has used guided bombs to kill at least 25 civilians in Kharkiv.\n\nYet Ukraine has not been allowed to fire into Russia, Zelenskiy said. Nor did it have enough conventional weapons to equip reserve brigades, which might be deployed to push the Russians out.\n\n\"No one is accusing anyone,\" he said. \"We are where we are. We are fighting, and we are at war, and not at the beginning. That's why we need to find a way out of the situation every day.\"\n\nZelenskiy noted that western countries at peace had \"different priorities\" and, understandably, did not share Ukraine's sense of existential urgency. This meant that \"dialogue\" rather than action could be frustrating.\n\n\"For us, time is our life,\" he said. \"If you don't go down in a minute [to a bomb shelter] you can be dead. Therefore the attitude to time is completely different.\"\n\nHe said Russia was \"moving faster\" than the west in terms of making and supplying weapons for its armed forces. Zelenskiy likened Ukraine to a ship - \"not a sinking one\" - that had to get to its destination \"fairly\" and in one piece, saving \"as many lives as possible\".\n\nHe spoke, too, about the emotional and personal toll the war was taking on the people of his country. \"You don't know what war is until it comes to your house, to your street, to a friend of yours, to someone you studied with or to someone you love,\" he said. \"Until you have this, the war is somewhere afar.\"\n\nDuring his one-hour interview with the Guardian, Zelenskiy appeared relaxed and positive despite the bleak military situation and a gruelling schedule that saw him visit four EU countries this week. He described Johnson as a \"good friend\" who \"really helped Ukraine\". Asked if he missed the former prime minister, Zelenskiy joked: \"He does not give me the opportunity to miss him. He is always here.\"\n\nZelenskiy said he had used Johnson as an \"instrument\" to reach Trump, after Republicans in Congress spent six months obstructing aid to Ukraine. Johnson had a productive \"conversation\" with Trump, Zelenskiy said. It was one of several initiatives to get through to Republicans, including to the House speaker, Mike Johnson.\n\nOn Britain, Zelenskiy said good relations would continue, whatever the result of the 4 July general election. \"He [Keir Starmer] is a good guy ... Rishi is also a good guy,\" he said.\n\n\"It seems to me that the policy of Great Britain has never changed in relation to Ukraine. And it seems to me so important, because the leaders can be changed in different countries, but the most important is to never change the values ... We will be working with the choice of the British people, with the prime minister who will be elected by the people of Britain.\"\n\nWith no end to the war in sight, Zelenskiy said negotiations with Russia were unrealistic. He said a peace deal would be a \"trap\" since Putin would violate any agreement and \"could not be believed\".\n\nRussia's president launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 because the west had responded weakly to his annexation of Crimea and takeover of parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014, Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia insists Ukraine has to accept new territorial realities. Zelenskiy said Moscow would exploit any pause in the fighting to \"strengthen its muscles on the battlefield\" and would strike again, sooner or later. He said the conflict in Ukraine was similar to the second world war, though on a smaller scale, because of the \"ideology of Russian fascism\". Putin's brutal \"methodology\" was the same as in Nazi Germany, he stated. It featured \"mass executions, burials and rapes\".\n\nRussian soldiers even used the \"same routes\" as Hitler's army in their campaign to overrun Kyiv and to dominate the country, he said. If Russia won in Ukraine, Putin would seek to further reshape the boundaries of Europe by attacking other nations, , Zelenskiy said. \"This is the real third world war.\" He emphasised: \"I don't think Putin is crazy. He's dangerous. It's much scarier. You see, he will not stop.\"\n\nZelenskiy revealed he reads books about 20th-century history, a few pages before bed, that explore the \"mentalities\" of cold war figures, such as Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, and relations between the two superpowers, plus Cuba.\n\nThere is little prospect that Europe's biggest war since 1945 will end soon. Zelenskiy was elected in 2019. Elections that were due to take place this month have been postponed because of the conflict. Did he, at the age of 46, have the stamina to carry on? Zelenskiy said that when he became president he promised to be with the people \"until the end\" and to defend the constitution. It would therefore be unfair to show any weakness, he said.\n\n\"I just don't have the right. It is not worthy of me. And then you are a liar. I definitely wouldn't want to be a liar, especially for my children.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

blessing to Ukrainian strikes that can help it defend itself.\n\nUkraine \"can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations, including those

Zelensky has long said he will not negotiate with Russia directly until Moscow's forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.\n\nHis call, however, comes as Russia makes gains against Ukraine, with Kyiv suffering from a shortage of Western-supplied weapons.\n\nRussia, President Zelensky said, was dropping some 3,200 guided aerial bombs on Ukraine each month. \"How do you fight that?\" he asked reporters in Madrid where he met Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader rejected the idea of inviting Russia to a planned peace summit in Switzerland next month. The summit is expected to include representatives of more than 90 countries.\n\nFrance and Germany's leaders said on Tuesday that Ukraine should be allowed to hit military sites inside Russia from which missiles were being fired at Ukrainian territory, but not other targets.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned the West earlier in the day that NATO members in Europe were playing with fire by proposing to let Ukraine use Western-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia, which he said could trigger a global conflict.\n\n\"We support Ukraine and we don't want escalation, that hasn't changed,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Meseberg, Germany.\n\n\"We think we should allow them to neutralise military sites from which missiles are fired, military sites from which Ukraine is attacked, but we shouldn't allow them to hit other targets in Russia and civilian or other military sites in Russia.\"\n\nEurope has only a fraction of the air defence capabilities needed to protect its eastern flank, according to NATO's own internal calculations, laying bare the scale of the continent's vulnerabilities.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine has underscored the importance of air defence, as Kyiv begs the west for additional systems and rockets to protect its cities, troops and energy grid against daily bombing raids.\n\nBut according to people familiar with confidential defence plans drawn up last year, NATO states are able to provide less than five per cent of air defence capacities deemed necessary to protect its members in Central and Eastern Europe against a full-scale attack, the Financial Times reported this week.\n\nOne senior NATO diplomat told the FT that the ability to defend against missiles and air strikes was \"a major part of the plan to defend eastern Europe from invasion\", adding: \"And right now, we don't have that.\"\n\nGeorgia's parliament on Tuesday voted to override a presidential veto on the controversial \"foreign influence\" law, a move that is poised to derail the EU aspirations of many Georgians in favour of closer ties with Moscow. The divisive bill, which requires civil society organisations and media that receive more than 20 per cent of their revenues from abroad to register as \"organisations serving the interests of a foreign power\", was approved by the parliament earlier this month. The president, Salome Zourabichvili, later vetoed the law, which she and other critics argue is modelled on a 2012 Russian bill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Georgian NGOs vowed to defy the law. \"By adopting this law, the authorities want to subdue Georgia's civil sector,\" some 200 NGOs said in a statement. \"The Russian law will not work in our country and will remain an empty piece of paper, which nobody will obey,\" it added. Opposition parties and rights groups fear that the ruling Georgian Dream party will use the measures to tighten controls over election monitors and journalists to secure another victory in a parliamentary election scheduled for October.\n\nThe EU and US have been \"too soft\" on Serbia and should set a deadline for it to adopt sanctions on Russia, the Kosovan prime minister said this week. Albin Kurti said Belgrade needed to side with the west against Moscow to give Kosovo reassurance that it was committed to normalising relations. Brussels and Washington \"need to change their approach and give a timeline to Serbia\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009to put sanctions on the Russian Federation and to quit trying to sit on three or four stools,\" Kurti told the Financial Times in an interview.\n\nHungary's government signed an accord with Belarus to help build Hungary's second nuclear plant, Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said in a statement in Minsk on Wednesday. Hungary's PAK 2 reactor has been under construction by Russia's Rosatom since 2014. The Russian company is building two reactors with a capacity of 1.2 GW each at PAKS 2 in central Hungary. \"Of great importance is the agreement signed here today on nuclear energy cooperation, which allows us to use the experiences Belarus gained here while constructing reactors with a similar technology,\" Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said.\n\nBelarusian flag-carrier Belavia has failed to convince the European General Court to lift restrictions on the carrier, imposed after the airline was accused of aiding illegal migration to the EU for political purposes. State-owned Belavia was sanctioned over concerns that it was supporting efforts in 2021 by president Alexander Lukashenko's regime to undermine the EU, by transporting migrants from the Middle East to Minsk and facilitating illegal border crossings. Belavia claimed it did not receive any instructions from the Belarusian government ordering it to operate flights to facilitate illegal EU migration.\n\nPoland will have to pay 68 million euros in EU fines over the continued operation of the Turow coal mine despite court orders to the contrary, the EU's lower court ruled on Wednesday. In 2021, the European Commission ordered Warsaw to close down the controversial Turow open-cast coal mine in the German-Czech-Polish border region, saying it was endangering Czech groundwater levels. When the government failed to comply, the EU executive began levying fines of 500,000 euros per day -- deducting it from EU funds earmarked for the country.\n\nThe board of the company that owns the UK's Royal Mail has agreed to a formal takeover offer for the 500-year-old organisation. Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has firmed up an offer of five billion UK pounds, including assumed debts, for the company which employs more than 150,000 people. The entrepreneur said he had the \"utmost respect\" for its history and tradition. The offer includes commitments to retain the name, brand, UK headquarters and UK tax residency, as well as protections for employee benefits and pensions.\n\nRomania's FintechOS, an end-to-end financial product management platform, this week announced the successful completion of a 60 million US dollars Series B+ investment round led by Molten Ventures, Cipio Partners, and BlackRock, alongside existing investors EarlyBird VC, OTB VC, and Gapminder VC. The new funding round comes as the Romanian firm celebrates 40 per cent year-over-year growth and a 170 per cent increase in operating margins. The company says that it is on track to achieve break-even in 2024, underscoring its robust business model.\n\nPhoto: Volodymyr Zelensky official Facebook page.", "source": {"uri":

The American people are not interested in fighting a war,\" he continued. \"They don't want to send American troops overseas. This will backfire like many other of his schemes, right in his political face.\"\n\nThe officials, who were granted anonymity by the AP to discuss the sensitive subject, emphasized that the U.S. policy charging Ukraine not to use American-provided long-range missiles to strike inside Russia remains the same.\n\nBiden's move comes as Ukrainian officials have increased pressure on the U.S. government to allow its military to defend against attacks coming from inside Russia.\n\nOfficials and nations have increasingly been arguing that Ukraine must be able to defend its territory by attacking targets within Russian borders.\n\nEarlier this week, amid rising calls for action against Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of \"serious consequences\" if Western countries gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use their weapons to strike Russian targets.\n\n\"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\" Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan. \"In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with.\"\n\nThe Russian leader pointed out that many European countries have a \"dense population\" and \"small territory.\"\n\n\"And this factor, which they should keep in mind before they talk about striking deep into Russian territory, is a serious thing,\" he said.\n\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

Canada publicly gives Ukraine permission to do so with Canadian weapons. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Blinken finally seems to concede the same point, saying that Ukraine may 'adapt and adjust' its use of the weapons it gets i.e. striking targets inside Russia if needs be. As Russian forces have increasingly launched ordinance from inside Russia's own declared borders, the West has belatedly reacted with such resolutions. The question is why did it take so long and what was the concern in the first place.\n\nMost commentators explain it as follows - although the West didn't want Ukraine to lose, it also didn't want Russia to lose. If that sounds like a mystifying and contradictory principle, it translated into a concrete outcome on the ground: de facto Russian occupation and retention of a clear swath of Ukrainian territory in the east and south. Trouble is, Moscow didn't accept the tacit offering. Instead Putin powered forward and began bombing deep inside Ukraine, attacking civilian centers in cities and ultimately making moves on Karkhiv. As a result, after two years of war, the West's position has begun to shift, first with Eastern European and Baltic states followed now, it seems, by Canada, France, even Germany and possibly the US.\n\nWhat were they afraid of in the first place, this notion of Russia 'losing'. So what if Russia lost - what fear-filled scenario haunted top Western leaders, like Biden, so much that they sacrificed thousands of Ukrainian lives, civilians and military, to avoid the outcome of Russia losing? Again, most commentators intuited that scenario as fear of Russia disintegrating, fracturing into regions - intuited because none of the foot-dragging Western leaders actually articulated their fear openly. In actual fact, Russians losing the invasion(s) of Ukraine didn't necessarily mean Russia falling apart. It didn't necessarily mean that Putin would nuke random Western capitals - however much he intimated he would. It didn't mean that the Moscow regime would collapse if Russian troops withdrew from Ukraine's borders.\n\nBut this much is true: Putin has invested his threadbare legitimacy in restituting Russian imperial glory and global influence. If he lost in Ukraine, his raison d'etre would evaporate, along with his internal popularity. The various pillars upholding the state would totter. The Orthodox church for example would wobble, suddenly wedded to a losing regime, rather than to a grand triumphant reinvigorator of Christian Orthodoxy's conquering history. The internal security organs would be mocked for shoring up the power of a failing leader. The circles of oligarchs would shake off their fear-based allegiance to Putin. And let's not forget that the two times Moscow's central power collapsed in the last century or so happened through failed foreign wars: WWI and Afghanistan. So, yes, a ripple effect all the way to the Kremlin's gates might ensue if Putin failed in Ukraine.\n\nAnd so? How bad could it be? Why is it a greater concern than the slaughter of Ukrainians? Let's consider the scenarios. Putin implodes, instability, civil war and control over nukes gets loosened. That's one scenario, a plausible one, but not a decisive one because the chain of command to the nukes doesn't evaporate with Putin gone. It didn't with the Soviet collapse. And whoever ousts Putin knows better than to risk the destruction of Russia and the world with a mad decision. That aside, civil war in Russia is no concern of the West, or shouldn't be. It's not a rare occurence. In fact, most of the current and former Soviet colonies welcome the prospect.\n\nThe truth is, the Russian federation much like the Soviet Union is a centripetal construct - it wants to fall apart - with the regions yearning for their own future, partly for ethnic reasons and partly because it was always an enforced unity. None of those populations got any outstanding benefits to speak of. They've remained poor, underdeveloped and addicted to alcohol. Certainly, there's some possibility of mass refugee movements to the West but the local folk will stay put if they profit from selling their natural resources directly to the world rather than via Moscow.\n\nNo, the great fear in Washington and Berlin is more domestic - fear of internal economic consequences. The banking, fossil fuel, commodities industries play a big part in our economies. They have a say in Washington, and one can't blame them for being anxious. The disruption in their business with the Russian landmass can certainly affect Western domestic conditions economically - rise in oil prices etc - and these lobbies are happy to dwell on all the other abovementioned fears. This, at least in part, likely explains the delays in supplying Ukraine with sufficient weapons and the prohibitions on their use - until now. Putin has been yellow-lighted numerous times since he first bombed Chechnya to smithereens and he has blown past the warning signs each time. It's now clear to our leaders that indulging him further is more dangerous than all the downsides of Russia conspicuously losing the war in Ukraine and all the supposed consequences that entails.",

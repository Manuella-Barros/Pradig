This reduced demand caused an inventory build-up,\" said Senior Research Analyst Shilpi Jain.\n\nHowever, summer sales at online channels, a good harvest, and aggressive promotions towards the end of the quarter provided relief to OEMs, helping close the quarter on a better note than at the beginning, she said.\n\nCanalys had separately reported that India's smartphone shipments grew only 1% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, totaling 36.4 million units.\n\nXiaomi reclaimed the first rank with a volume share of 18.9% in Q2 2024, up from the 10% it had in Q1 2024. In Q2 2023, the brand held a share of 15%, as per the research firm's data, while as per Canalys, the brand regained the top spot after six quarters - or for the first time since Q1 2023.\n\nXiaomi's shipments were up by 23% year-on-year, driven by a streamlined and focused portfolio that spans from the entry-level to affordable premium segments. To further solidify its position, the company employed a strategy to push flagship handsets, improve marketing and expand distribution channels, according to Jain.\n\nVivo followed closely in the second rank with an 18.8% share, while Samsung slipped to the third position with a share of 18.1%, Counterpoint data showed.\n\nRealme and Oppo closed the charts at fourth and fifth ranks with a share of 12.5% and 11.4%, respectively.\n\nBy contrast, Research Analyst Shubham Singh said the smartphone market achieved its highest-ever value in Q2 2024 driven by the premiumisation trend as consumers continued to upgrade to higher-value smartphones, supported by better trade-in values and easy financing schemes.\n\n\"This resulted in a 24% YoY growth in the ultra-premium (>INR 45,000) segment,\" Singh said.\n\nSamsung led the market with a 25% value share, followed by Vivo, and Apple.\n\nSingh said Apple is expected to rebound in the September quarter driven by the recent price cuts across the entire range of iPhones.\n\nAdditionally, Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the six months ending June 30, witnessing a 567% year-on-year rise in shipments.\n\nMotorola grew by 88% year-on-year, while Poco was the fastest-growing brand in the Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 segment with a 318% year-on-year growth in shipments.\n\nMediaTek led India's smartphone chipset market with a 54% share.

Xiaomi grabbed the top spot in the smartphone shipments of Q2 2024 courtesy of it pushing its flagship handsets, while Samsung carried over its strong performance from the last quarter, leading in terms of overall value, with its ultra-premium segment registering a staggering 99 percent YoY increase.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research's Monthly India Smartphone Tracker, Xiaomi had a 23 percent YoY growth in its shipments, rising from 15 percent in Q1 2023 to 18.9 percent in Q2 2024. Courtesy of this rise, the Chinese company reclaimed the top spot in the Indian smartphone market in terms of units shipped, with improved marketing and expansive distribution being tipped as some of the contributing factors.\n\nSmartphone Market Volume Share in Q2 2024\n\nPhoto Credit: Counterpoint Research\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung led in value terms, registering a 1.3 percent increase in the Indian market value share. According to the firm, the South Korean technology conglomerate is expected to maintain its leadership following the introduction of its latest flagship foldable smartphones - the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6.\n\nIn the same criteria, Vivo attained the second spot with a 16.8 percent value share while Apple ranked third with a 16.3 percent share. The iPhone maker is expected to make a comeback in the next quarter, with the recent price reductions across its entire range of iPhone models being touted as a driving factor.\n\nWhile brands registered growth in terms of value and shipments, the overall shipments declined by 2 percent YoY. As per the tracker, heatwave, a seasonal slump, and slower demand compared to last quarter may be behind this fall. However, the 5G adoption in India is showing consistent growth, with 5G smartphones having a 77 percent share in the total shipments in Q2 2024. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) introducing more affordable 5G handsets is tipped to be one of the contributing factors.\n\nIn terms of trends, Nothing registered the highest growth in the first half of the year, registering a 567 percent YoY increase courtesy of recently introduced offerings like Nothing Phone 2a and CMF Phone 1.\n\nThe chipset market in India is also seeing competition between two global tech giants: MediaTek and Qualcomm.

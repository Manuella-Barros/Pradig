Up until now, Argentina\u2019s head of state had maintained his political capital, despite suffering substantial defeats, such as the initial collapse of the so-called \u2018Omnibus\u2019 bill in Congress, though to a certain extent, he came out strengthened from that dispute. He fared even better in the face of street-blocking protests, with Security Minister Patricia Bullrich effectively limiting the power of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) umbrella union grouping and leftist social movements\u2019 power through an \u2018anti-picket\u2019 protocol. Picking fights with his preferred enemies \u2013 whether they be journalists or politicians \u2013 allowed the ultra-libertarian to use his \u201ccaste-gun,\u201d painting the scarlet letter on his opponents and relying on his digital communications machine to come out victorious in the eyes of the public. But that\u2019s not what happened during a multitudinous march in defence of the public university system in late April, which saw the masses take the streets peacefully in order to protest an apparent libertarian \u2018chainsaw\u2019 attack against the beloved UBA (Universidad de Buenos Aires) and its sister institutions scattered federally throughout the provinces. Regardless of Manuel Adorni\u2019s attempts at defending the president\u2019s position (the presidential spokesman was forced to deny that the administration is looking to shut down state universities), and even though several of the toxic members of \u201cthe caste\u201d joined the crowds (giving the libertarian digital information war machine fodder), the crowds made their point loud and clear. Milei and La Libertad Avanza clearly suffered a political defeat that day and it actually hit them where it hurts: their electorate. It doesn't appear the case that the march marked a turning point of sorts in the President\u2019s relationship with the public. As happened in previous confrontations with its political adversaries, the president sought to discredit the participants via ad hominem attacks blurted out over social media, retweeting nasty comments and memes posted by his paid network of influencers, before sending out Adorni try to defend the government\u2019s position in a daily press conference. This is all part of a well-crafted strategy of political communications, supposedly led by political strategist Santiago Caputo \u2014 the self proclaimed \u201cpolitical commissar\u201d of the government \u2014 that operates within the sphere of \u201csynthetic power,\u201d as previously analysed in this column. Conceptually it refers to a new way in which certain social actors build substantial political capital using the digital information ecosystem, which is structurally different to the way power structures are traditionally built and maintained. During the month-long showdown over the Omnibus bill, Milei and his La Libertad Avanza party managed to set the stage for an ambush of the political class, creating the illusion of a negotiation and ultimately pulling the bill and digitally lynching the legislators who weren\u2019t aligned with them. In tandem, the left-wing social movements first and the CGT later mobilized to the Plaza de Mayo in downtown Buenos Aires, only to be used as guinea pigs by the Security Ministry to test out Bullrich\u2019s brand-new protocol. As protesters timidly marched and then quickly dispersed, Milei, his sister Karina and their gang celebrated another political victory, claiming they had \u201ctamed\u201d the wild \u201clefties.\u201d The government\u2019s response to the march in defence of the public university system was similar to their usual approach, but the impact wasn\u2019t the same \u2013 the social agenda finally sided against Milei on a major issue. That time around, the response to the chainsaw austerity plan and its impact on state universities was overwhelming. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets throughout the country, where there was a clear grassroots movement (mainly composed of students and the middle class with a peaceful intention to express their distaste at the president\u2019s general negative disposition toward UBA and public education in general). The specific arguments used by La Libertad Avanza weren\u2019t all that relevant to the crowd, who saw in Milei\u2019s \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d libertarianism an intention to eliminate public schooling to make way for the private sector (if indeed there is a market there).

For whatever reason, though a majority of the population sides with Milei in his battle against politically correct and culturally progressive institutions and trends, the attacks against public education hit a social nerve that sparked a popular response. Historically, Argentines have been proud of the history of the free and universal education system in the country, starting with Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, considered one of the founding fathers of the nation. Even if a large portion of the population agrees that the educational system has fallen victim to the same forces of decrepitude as the rest of society, UBA and the university system are still a source of pride, and they do well in the international rankings. According to Ecuadorean political strategist Jaime Dur\u00e1n Barba (who happens to have been one of Santiago Caputo\u2019s mentors), the Milei administration is making a big mistake in picking a fight with the country\u2019s youth, who by definition are rebellious and historically have been at the forefront of moments of social revolution and change. Speaking at an exclusive livestream event for Perfil\u2019s digital subscribers a few weeks ago, he noted that the communications strategy pursued by the government is mistaken, saying that its intention is persecution, as opposed to relying on a message of hope. It was that orientation that allowed Milei\u2019s campaign to reach people of all ages and social classes during the campaign. But if they don\u2019t change their strategy, according to Dur\u00e1n Barba, the risk of social upheaval in this difficult economic context will rise. The use of synthetic power has allowed this President to force the implosion of the Juntos por el Cambio coalition, which seemingly had the election in the bag at one point last year. Former Buenos Aires City mayor Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta didn\u2019t even make it past the PASO primary, while Patricia Bullrich was ultimately absorbed into the government. It also allowed Milei and his four English mastiffs to beat a sitting Peronist administration, banded in the Uni\u00f3n por la Patria coalition and with the support of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and Sergio Massa in control of the budget, in the race for the Casa Rosada. There are little doubts as to the real-world effects of synthetic power. Milei remains deeply popular and continues to wield vast power. Yet, he should be wary of hubris, as his power is not eternal \u2013 even if sometimes it can feel like it.

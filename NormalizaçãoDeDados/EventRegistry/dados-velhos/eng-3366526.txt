Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.\n\nThere was no let up in the flood situation in Assam, Bihar and north Bengal on Wednesday with more deaths being reported from the states due to the natural calamity.\n\nThe number of lives lost in the third wave of floods in Assam increased by 11, taking the toll to 39. Around 33.45 lakh people in 24 of the 32 districts in the state remained affected due to the floods.\n\nThe number of lives claimed by the floods in Assam so far this year stood at 123, including eight in Guwahati.\n\nAssam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal o Wednesday left for Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and apprise him of the preliminary damage caused by the third wave of floods.\n\nAccording to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), Dhubri, with 8.5 lakh affected people, was the worst hit, followed by Morigaon where 5.1 lakh people were affected.\n\nAs many as 2,970 villages were under water and 1.43 lakh hectares of crop area were damaged, the report said.\n\nThe ASDMA said the authorities were running 304 relief camps and distribution centres in 21 districts, where 1,38,648 people had taken shelter.\n\nOver 4,600 people have been evacuated to safer places by State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel.\n\nThe flood has damaged embankments, roads, bridges etc. in several districts.\n\nThe ASDMA said heavy erosion was witnessed in Chirang and Biswanath districts.\n\nThe Brahmaputra river was flowing above the danger mark at Guwahati, Nimatighat in Jorhat, Tezpur in Sonitpur, Goalpara and Dhubri towns, officials said.\n\nOther rivers such as the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat, Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, Kopili at Dharamtul in Nagaon, Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta, Kushiyara at Karimganj town were flowing above the danger mark, they added.\n\nMost of the forest areas in the Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawkhua Wildlife Sanctuary were under the flood waters, they said.\n\nIn Bihar, the toll mounted to 72 from 56 on Tuesday and around 73.44 lakh people in 14 districts were affected by the floods, triggered by incessant rains in Nepal and the northern parts of the state.\n\nAnirudh Kumar, Special Secretary, state Disaster Management department, said Gopalgunj was the latest district to be hit by the floods, which had engulfed 110 blocks and 1,151 panchayats.\n\nHe added that 2.74 lakh people were shifted to safer places and of them, 1.16 lakh were put up in 504 relief camps.\n\nCommunity kitchens were opened for those in the marooned areas and anganwadi centres and railway stations in Katihar district were being used for running them, Pratyay Amrit, Principal Secretary, Disaster Management department, said.\n\nChief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was scheduled to conduct an aerial survey of Bettiah and Valmikinagar during the day, along with Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, could not do so due to bad weather conditions.\n\nHe, however, monitored the flood situation from Patna by interacting with senior government officials.\n\nTrain services continued to be affected due to the calamity and rail movement was completely disrupted in many sections, a statement from Rajesh Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer, East Central Railways, said.\n\nIn the six districts of north Bengal, at least 32 persons have died and over 14 lakh people were affected due to the floods, caused partly due to the overflowing rivers of Bhutan, Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nA senior official in West Bengal's disaster management department said the highest number of 3,64,043 people were hit in Malda, followed by 3,53,328 in Alipurduar, 1,78,546 in Jalpaiguri, 1,30,634 in Cooch Behar, 1,25,435 in South Dinajpur and 1,20,000 in North Dinajpur districts.\n\nA total of 622 relief camps were set up with government aid, while nearly 800 of such camps were set up by various NGOs, he added.\n\n\"Currently, around 1,38,134 people have taken shelter in the relief camps,\" the official said, adding that nearly three lakh hectares of agricultural land had been submerged.\n\nHe said around eight NDRF and four SDRF teams were working in the six flood-hit districts, while cooked food, dry food and drinking water were being distributed.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reacted sharply to a reported statement by a Union minister and said providing relief to the flood-hit people was the \"first priority\" of the state government.\n\n\"We have to rescue the people first and only after that we will start evaluating the magnitude of damage due to the floods. I have already spoken to the prime minister and home minister,\" she told reporters while reacting to the statement that a state had to submit a memorandum to the Centre for flood relief funds.\n\nThe Eastern Railways said it would run four pairs of special trains from tomorrow to clear the rush of passengers between Sealdah and Malda, but train services beyond Malda, to different destinations of north Bengal and Assam, would continue to remain suspended owing to the flooding of the railway tracks.\n\nOne train would leave Sealdah and one from Malda on four consecutive days, an Eastern Railway spokesman said.\n\nThe railway tracks at various places in Bihar, north Bengal and Assam continued to be submerged.\n\nAs a result, all passenger train services connecting north Bengal and Assam to Kolkata remained suspended for the fourth consecutive day.\n\nThe Eastern Railway cancelled 14 mail and express trains on Wednesday.\n\n\"The tracks are submerged at various places and the train services can be restored only after the water recedes and the tracks are tested to ensure safety,\" the Eastern Railway spokesman said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Around 33.45 lakh people in 24 of the 32 districts in the state remained affected due to the floods.\n\nThe number of lives claimed by the floods in Assam so far this year stood at 123, including eight in Guwahati.\n\nAssam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal o Wednesday left for Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and apprise him of the preliminary damage caused by the third wave of floods.\n\nAccording to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), Dhubri, with 8.5 lakh affected people, was the worst hit, followed by Morigaon where 5.1 lakh people were affected.\n\nAs many as 2,970 villages were under water and 1.43 lakh hectares of crop area were damaged, the report said.\n\nThe ASDMA said the authorities were running 304 relief camps and distribution centres in 21 districts, where 1,38,648 people had taken shelter.\n\nOver 4,600 people have been evacuated to safer places by State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel.\n\nThe flood has damaged embankments, roads, bridges etc. in several districts.\n\nThe ASDMA said heavy erosion was witnessed in Chirang and Biswanath districts.\n\nThe Brahmaputra river was flowing above the danger mark at Guwahati, Nimatighat in Jorhat, Tezpur in Sonitpur, Goalpara and Dhubri towns, officials said.\n\nOther rivers such as the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat, Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, Kopili at Dharamtul in Nagaon, Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta, Kushiyara at Karimganj town were flowing above the danger mark, they added.\n\nMost of the forest areas in the Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawkhua Wildlife Sanctuary were under the flood waters, they said.\n\nIn Bihar, the toll mounted to 72 from 56 on Tuesday and around 73.44 lakh people in 14 districts were affected by the floods, triggered by incessant rains in Nepal and the northern parts of the state.\n\nAnirudh Kumar, Special Secretary, state Disaster Management department, said Gopalgunj was the latest district to be hit by the floods, which had engulfed 110 blocks and 1,151 panchayats.\n\nHe added that 2.74 lakh people were shifted to safer places and of them, 1.16 lakh were put up in 504 relief camps.\n\nCommunity kitchens were opened for those in the marooned areas and anganwadi centres and railway stations in Katihar district were being used for running them, Pratyay Amrit, Principal Secretary, Disaster Management department, said.\n\nChief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was scheduled to conduct an aerial survey of Bettiah and Valmikinagar during the day, along with Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, could not do so due to bad weather conditions.\n\nHe, however, monitored the flood situation from Patna by interacting with senior government officials.\n\nTrain services continued to be affected due to the calamity and rail movement was completely disrupted in many sections, a statement from Rajesh Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer, East Central Railways, said.\n\nIn the six districts of north Bengal, at least 32 persons have died and over 14 lakh people were affected due to the floods, caused partly due to the overflowing rivers of Bhutan, Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nA senior official in West Bengal's disaster management department said the highest number of 3,64,043 people were hit in Malda, followed by 3,53,328 in Alipurduar, 1,78,546 in Jalpaiguri, 1,30,634 in Cooch Behar, 1,25,435 in South Dinajpur and 1,20,000 in North Dinajpur districts.\n\nA total of 622 relief camps were set up with government aid, while nearly 800 of such camps were set up by various NGOs, he added.\n\n\"Currently, around 1,38,134 people have taken shelter in the relief camps,\" the official said, adding that nearly three lakh hectares of agricultural land had been submerged.\n\nHe said around eight NDRF and four SDRF teams were working in the six flood-hit districts, while cooked food, dry food and drinking water were being distributed.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reacted sharply to a reported statement by a Union minister and said providing relief to the flood-hit people was the \"first priority\" of the state government.\n\n\"We have to rescue the people first and only after that we will start evaluating the magnitude of damage due to the floods. I have already spoken to the prime minister and home minister,\" she told reporters while reacting to the statement that a state had to submit a memorandum to the Centre for flood relief funds.\n\nThe Eastern Railways said it would run four pairs of special trains from tomorrow to clear the rush of passengers between Sealdah and Malda, but train services beyond Malda, to different destinations of north Bengal and Assam, would continue to remain suspended owing to the flooding of the railway tracks.\n\nOne train would leave Sealdah and one from Malda on four consecutive days, an Eastern Railway spokesman said.\n\nThe railway tracks at various places in Bihar, north Bengal and Assam continued to be submerged.\n\nAs a result, all passenger train services connecting north Bengal and Assam to Kolkata remained suspended for the fourth consecutive day.\n\nThe Eastern Railway cancelled 14 mail and express trains on Wednesday.\n\n\"The tracks are submerged at various places and the train services can be restored only after the water recedes and the tracks are tested to ensure safety,\" the Eastern Railway spokesman said.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

(Bihar) till August 20 due to the prevailing flood situation.\n\nAccording to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) on Wednesday, 11 people have died in the last 24 hours in different flood affected districts of the state, taking the latest toll to 39.\n\nBesides, 84 people have died in the first wave of floods that hit the state between April to June this year.\n\nThe Assam government has pressed into service Army and Border Security Force officials besides the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) officials in relief and rescue operations in different parts of the state.\n\nThe flood has taken a serious turn under Kaliabor subdivision in Nagaon district forcing the district administration to announce closure of schools and

said the government has accorded top priority to the relief material distribution and the district administrations have been pressed into service to meet the requirements.\n\nSince the South Salmara-Mankachar district is situated along the sensitive India-Bangladesh border, the government has taken the flood situation there very seriously the and district administration has been directed to take urgent measures for relief and rescue operations, he added.\n\n\"At least 120 passengers who are stranded at Guwahati station... the railway administration is taking all necessary steps to

(PTI Photo) ihar floods: Death toll rises to 72Bihar floods: NDRF personnel helps deliver a baby on rescue boatBihar floods: Death toll climbs to 56, 69 lakh people affected\n\nThere was no let up in the flood situation in Assam, Bihar and north Bengal today with more deaths being reported from the states due to the natural calamity. The number of lives lost in the third wave of floods in Assam increased by 11, taking the toll to 39. Around 33.45 lakh people in 24 of the 32 districts in the state remained affected due to the floods. The number of lives claimed by the floods in Assam so far this year stood at 123, including eight in Guwahati.\n\nAssam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal today left for Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and apprise him of the preliminary damage caused by the third wave of floods. According to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), Dhubri, with 8.5 lakh affected people, was the worst hit, followed by Morigaon where 5.1 lakh people were affected. As many as 2,970 villages were under water and 1.43 lakh hectares of crop area were damaged, the report said.\n\nThe ASDMA said the authorities were running 304 relief camps and distribution centres in 21 districts, where 1,38,648 people had taken shelter. Over 4,600 people have been evacuated to safer places by State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel. The flood has damaged embankments, roads, bridges etc. in several districts.\n\nThe ASDMA said heavy erosion was witnessed in Chirang and Biswanath districts. The Brahmaputra river was flowing above the danger mark at Guwahati, Nimatighat in Jorhat, Tezpur in Sonitpur, Goalpara and Dhubri towns, officials said.\n\nOther rivers such as the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat, Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, Kopili at Dharamtul in Nagaon, Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta, Kushiyara at Karimganj town were flowing above the danger mark, they added. Most of the forest areas in the Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawkhua Wildlife Sanctuary were under the flood waters, they said.\n\nIn Bihar, the toll mounted to 72 from 56 yesterday and around 73.44 lakh people in 14 districts were affected by the floods, triggered by incessant rains in Nepal and the northern parts of the state. Anirudh Kumar, Special Secretary, state Disaster Management department, said Gopalgunj was the latest district to be hit by the floods, which had engulfed 110 blocks and 1,151 panchayats. He added that 2.74 lakh people were shifted to safer places and of them, 1.16 lakh were put up in 504 relief camps.\n\nCommunity kitchens were opened for those in the marooned areas and anganwadi centres and railway stations in Katihar district were being used for running them, Pratyay Amrit, Principal Secretary, Disaster Management department, said.\n\nChief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was scheduled to conduct an aerial survey of Bettiah and Valmikinagar during the day, along with Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, could not do so due to bad weather conditions. He, however, monitored the flood situation from Patna by interacting with senior government officials.\n\nTrain services continued to be affected due to the calamity and rail movement was completely disrupted in many sections, a statement from Rajesh Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer, East Central Railways, said.\n\nIn the six districts of north Bengal, at least 32 persons have died and over 14 lakh people were affected due to the floods, caused partly due to the overflowing rivers of Bhutan, Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nA senior official in West Bengal's disaster management department said the highest number of 3,64,043 people were hit in Malda, followed by 3,53,328 in Alipurduar, 1,78,546 in Jalpaiguri, 1,30,634 in Cooch Behar, 1,25,435 in South Dinajpur and 1,20,000 in North Dinajpur districts. A total of 622 relief camps were set up with government aid, while nearly 800 of such camps were set up by various NGOs, he added.\n\n\"Currently, around 1,38,134 people have taken shelter in the relief camps,\" the official said, adding that nearly three lakh hectares of agricultural land had been submerged. He said around eight NDRF and four SDRF teams were working in the six flood-hit districts, while cooked food, dry food and drinking water were being distributed.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reacted sharply to a reported statement by a Union minister and said providing relief to the flood-hit people was the \"first priority\" of the state government.\n\n\"We have to rescue the people first and only after that we will start evaluating the magnitude of damage due to the floods. I have already spoken to the prime minister and home minister,\" she told reporters while reacting to the statement that a state had to submit a memorandum to the Centre for flood relief funds.\n\nThe Eastern Railways said it would run four pairs of special trains from tomorrow to clear the rush of passengers between Sealdah and Malda, but train services beyond Malda, to different destinations of north Bengal and Assam, would continue to remain suspended owing to the flooding of the railway tracks. One train would leave Sealdah and one from Malda on four consecutive days, an Eastern Railway spokesman said.\n\nThe railway tracks at various places in Bihar, north Bengal and Assam continued to be submerged. As a result, all passenger train services connecting north Bengal and Assam to Kolkata remained suspended for the fourth consecutive day. The Eastern Railway cancelled 14 mail and express trains today.\n\n\"The tracks are submerged at various places and the train services can be restored only after the water recedes and the tracks are tested to ensure safety,\" the Eastern Railway spokesman said.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Assam floods Bihar Floods West Bengal floods", "date":

Around 33.45 lakh people in 24 of the 32 districts in the state remained affected due to the floods.\n\nThe number of lives claimed by the floods in Assam so far this year stood at 123, including eight in Guwahati.\n\nAssam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal today left for Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and apprise him of the preliminary damage caused by the third wave of floods.\n\nAccording to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), Dhubri, with 8.5 lakh affected people, was the worst hit, followed by Morigaon where 5.1 lakh people were affected.\n\nAs many as 2,970 villages were under water and 1.43 lakh hectares of crop area were damaged, the report said.\n\nThe ASDMA said the authorities were running 304 relief camps and distribution centres in 21 districts, where 1,38,648 people had taken shelter.\n\nOver 4,600 people have been evacuated to safer places by State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel.\n\nThe flood has damaged embankments, roads, bridges etc. in several districts.\n\nThe ASDMA said heavy erosion was witnessed in Chirang and Biswanath districts.\n\nThe Brahmaputra river was flowing above the danger mark at Guwahati, Nimatighat in Jorhat, Tezpur in Sonitpur, Goalpara and Dhubri towns, officials said.\n\nOther rivers such as the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat, Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, Kopili at Dharamtul in Nagaon, Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta, Kushiyara at Karimganj town were flowing above the danger mark, they added.\n\nMost of the forest areas in the Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawkhua Wildlife Sanctuary were under the flood waters, they said.\n\nIn Bihar, the toll mounted to 72 from 56 yesterday and around 73.44 lakh people in 14 districts were affected by the floods, triggered by incessant rains in Nepal and the northern parts of the state.\n\nAnirudh Kumar, Special Secretary, state Disaster Management department, said Gopalgunj was the latest district to be hit by the floods, which had engulfed 110 blocks and 1,151 panchayats.\n\nHe added that 2.74 lakh people were shifted to safer places and of them, 1.16 lakh were put up in 504 relief camps.\n\nCommunity kitchens were opened for those in the marooned areas and anganwadi centres and railway stations in Katihar district were being used for running them, Pratyay Amrit, Principal Secretary, Disaster Management department, said.\n\nChief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was scheduled to conduct an aerial survey of Bettiah and Valmikinagar during the day, along with Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, could not do so due to bad weather conditions.\n\nHe, however, monitored the flood situation from Patna by interacting with senior government officials.\n\nTrain services continued to be affected due to the calamity and rail movement was completely disrupted in many sections, a statement from Rajesh Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer, East Central Railways, said.\n\nIn the six districts of north Bengal, at least 32 persons have died and over 14 lakh people were affected due to the floods, caused partly due to the overflowing rivers of Bhutan, Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nA senior official in West Bengal's disaster management department said the highest number of 3,64,043 people were hit in Malda, followed by 3,53,328 in Alipurduar, 1,78,546 in Jalpaiguri, 1,30,634 in Cooch Behar, 1,25,435 in South Dinajpur and 1,20,000 in North Dinajpur districts.\n\nA total of 622 relief camps were set up with government aid, while nearly 800 of such camps were set up by various NGOs, he added.\n\n\"Currently, around 1,38,134 people have taken shelter in the relief camps,\" the official said, adding that nearly three lakh hectares of agricultural land had been submerged.\n\nHe said around eight NDRF and four SDRF teams were working in the six flood-hit districts, while cooked food, dry food and drinking water were being distributed.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reacted sharply to a reported statement by a Union minister and said providing relief to the flood-hit people was the \"first priority\" of the state government.\n\n\"We have to rescue the people first and only after that we will start evaluating the magnitude of damage due to the floods. I have already spoken to the prime minister and home minister,\" she told reporters while reacting to the statement that a state had to submit a memorandum to the Centre for flood relief funds.\n\nThe Eastern Railways said it would run four pairs of special trains from tomorrow to clear the rush of passengers between Sealdah and Malda, but train services beyond Malda, to different destinations of north Bengal and Assam, would continue to remain suspended owing to the flooding of the railway tracks.\n\nOne train would leave Sealdah and one from Malda on four consecutive days, an Eastern Railway spokesman said.\n\nThe railway tracks at various places in Bihar, north Bengal and Assam continued to be submerged.\n\nAs a result, all passenger train services connecting north Bengal and Assam to Kolkata remained suspended for the fourth consecutive day.\n\nThe Eastern Railway cancelled 14 mail and express trains today.\n\n\"The tracks are submerged at various places and the train services can be restored only after the water recedes and the tracks are tested to ensure safety,\" the Eastern Railway spokesman said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is

River embankments gave way in many places, affecting humans, cattle and crop alike.\n\nIn central Assam, 83 villages in Biswanath district and 64 in Sonitpur district lie submerged. The second wave of flood has affected about 1.13 lakh people in Sonitpur, according to the ASDMA. Tezpur, Thelamara, Nadaur and Dhekiajuli are the worst-affect regions in the district.\n\nRepresentational image. AP\n\nA huge part of Silghat near Kaliabor sub-division is submerged with flood water of Brahmaputra river, resulting in closure of the Assam Co-operative Jute Mill for the time being. Sonitpur Deputy Commissioner Manoj Kumar Deka said the water level of Brahmaputra and its tributaries had crossed the danger level but has been receding since Tuesday.\n\nThe flood has cut off Dhemaji district in the eastern part of the state completely from the rest of the world. The Kumotia bridge, which connects it to Lakhimpur in Assam and to Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh, has been closed as per the district administration's order. The overflowing Jiya Dhol river has breached embankment in Dihiri village in the district, submerging 22 villages.\n\nDipankar Rajbanshi, a farmer from Bamun Gaon in Dhemaji district, told Firstpost that water level started rising in the wee hours of Tuesday night and they had to evacuate the village with whatever essentials they could get their hands on.\n\nThe Goriakhana embankment in Adarsh Gaon in Dhemaji also gave way on Monday night, inundating National Highway 15 and leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded. Seventy-two habitations in Majuli, the world's largest river island and Assam chief minister's assembly constituency, are completely inundated, according to the ASDMA. Like Dhemaji, Majuli too lies cut off from the rest of the state as the ferry boat service to and from Jorhat district has been stopped. Reportedly, a four-year-old child died in Majuli owing to the flood.\n\nRanjan Bora, a local reporter from Majuli, told Firstpost while the death toll is low this time, the extent of damage is quite high. He said while some people are returning to their homes, the destruction of crop will have them suffering a lot.\n\nAccording to the ASDMA's report dated 15 August, more than 1.82 lakh hectares of crop area has been affected. Morigaon district is the worst hit, having almost 29,500 hectares of harvested land under water. Till July-end last year, the quantum of affected crop area was 1.49 lakh hectares in the state.\n\nThe state government has set up 315 relief camps in 21 districts. Reports of people in the flood-affected regions dying or going missing came in from across the state and the ASDMA pegged the death toll at 10 till the evening of 15 August. The State Disaster Response Force has been given the charge of rescue operations.\n\nResidents of Balaji sub-division of Barpeta district said about 250 families have been displaced owing to the breach in Kaldia river's embankment. The flood has affected about 4.37 lakh people in Barpeta alone, making it one of the worst-hit districts. Seasonal islands formed amid rivers and tributaries, called char in Assam, have been reeling under the impact of flood for the last two months. Many schools on these islands are under water. In Dhubri district, embankments have been reportedly giving way in new areas every day.\n\nMore than half the area of Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat and Bokakhat districts is under water, Divisional Forest Officer Rohini B Saikia said. She said animals have been moving to highways and other high land outside the park, making them extremely vulnerable to poachers.\n\n\"The flood situation in Kaziranga is gradually improving. Till a few days ago, 90 percent of the park was under water. Now, water is receding. At present, our prime focus is to guard the animals,\" she said.\n\nAs many as 115 animals have died at Kaziranga National Park between 10 and 16 August because of the flood.

From posh urban areas to remotest corners of the state, floodwaters have engulfed almost every length and breadth of the northeastern state.\n\nNow, reports say that the native village of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal is facing the threat of being washed away by floodwaters. The woes of CM's village, Mulukgaon under Chabua revenue circle in Dibrugarh district, have been aggravated because of perennial erosion affecting the upper region of Assam.\n\nAlong with his village, CM's paternal house is also facing the heat of floods as it is just 500 metres away from the Dibru river, where water is flowing above the danger level.\n\nThe tiny village of the CM, Mulukgaon, has at least 80 houses where around 300 people stay. The villagers fear that if rains continue then soon the entire village would be washed away.\n\nThe Chabua revenue circle is one of the worst flood-affected areas in the state, this year. Because of floods since June, many people of Chabua are already staying in relief camps set-up by the state government.\n\nChabua member of legislative assembly (MLA) Binod Hazarika told The Telegraph, \"I have visited the place to take stock of the erosion, which is posing a serious threat to the people of the area. In the last 10 years, the river has come closer to the village because of constant erosion. Earlier, the river was 10 km from the residence of the CM.\"\n\n\"Our government is serious about the problem and the dredging of the Brahmaputra river will start soon. If the erosion continues for a year, the whole area will be gobbled up by the river,\" he added.\n\nThe residents of the CM's village are unhappy that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not do much to solve the twin issues of floods and erosion.\n\n\"We are facing the wrath of constant erosion. This year, 800-900 hectares were eroded under Bindhakata gaon panchayat. We have voted the BJP to power to solve this perennial problem and we hope that the government will solve it,'' said Sailen Saikia, a resident of Mulukgaon.\n\nThe flood situation in Assam remained very critical on Thursday as 10 more people lost their lives while 31.55 lakh are still affected in 24 districts of the state. With Thursday's deaths, the toll in the latest wave of floods in the state rose to 49. The overall death figure in this year's flood in Assam is 133.\n\nAccording to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 2,584 villages are inundated and 1.67 lakh hectares of crop area are damaged across the state.\n\nAuthorities are running 602 relief camps and distribution centres in 21 districts, where 1,01,035 people have taken shelter. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and district administration personnel have rescued nearly 3,500 people to safer places in many districts.\n\nThe floods have damaged embankments, roads, bridges and other infrastructures in several districts of the state. Currently, the Brahmaputra river and its tributaries are flowing above the danger mark in several parts of Assam.\n\nVast forest areas in Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawkhua wildlife sanctuary are under the flood waters, the ASDMA report said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian Railways on Thursday said it has begun restoration work of damaged rail tracks and bridges to restart train services as soon as possible.\n\n\"While the overall flood situation continues to be grim in most part of Bihar and railway tracks remains breached in many locations, the Northeast Frontier (NF) Railway has started restoration work in all locations on a war footing,\" NF Railway chief public relations officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma said in a statement.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 1107, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "wgt": 100, "id": 1182, "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guw\u0101h\u0101ti"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guw\u0101h\u0101ti"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54420"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dibrugarh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibrugarh_district", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dibrugarh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54605"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55499"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303214", "label": {"eng": "Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303242", "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303248", "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304321", "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305466", "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309869", "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Disaster_Response_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314480", "label": {"eng": "National Disaster Response Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaziranga_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323933", "label": {"eng": "Kaziranga National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbananda_Sonowal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "326659", "label": {"eng": "Sarbananda Sonowal"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brahmaputra River"}, "type": "loc", "id": "326662"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "338527", "label": {"eng": "Indian Railways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "359469", "label": {"eng": "Northeast India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Assam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "362113", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of Assam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "371555", "label": {"eng": "Disaster response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_panchayat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "378697", "label": {"eng": "Gram panchayat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pobitora_Wildlife_Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "445405", "label": {"eng": "Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabua", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chabua"}, "type": "loc", "id": "788775"}]}

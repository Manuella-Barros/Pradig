Modi is set to be sworn in for a third term as Prime Minister.Other invited leaders, including Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', and Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, are expected to arrive on Sunday.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, \u201cFirst distinguished guest sets foot in New Delhi for the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The visit of one of our most valued partners will further strengthen the India-Bangladesh close and deep-rooted bonds of friendship.\" Prime Minister Hasina was warmly received by the MEA's secretary (CPV and OIA), Muktesh Pardeshi. Jaiswal also welcomed Vice-President Afif, saying, \"Warm welcome to Vice-President Ahmed Afif of Seychelles as he arrives in New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Council of Ministers.\"Following the swearing-in ceremony, Modi is expected to embark on his first foreign visit of his third term to Italy for the G7 Summit, scheduled from June 13 to 15 at Borgo Egnazia in Apulia. Though India is not a G7 member, Modi has regularly attended G7 Summits in recent years as a special invitee. The formal announcement of this visit is anticipated early next week.Notably, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was not invited to the ceremony, reflecting the strained relations between New Delhi and Islamabad. A Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson commented, \"We (Pakistan) do not have any comments on their (Indian) electoral process,\" adding that it is \"premature\" to discuss any congratulations before the new government is officially sworn in.In a Saturday morning statement, the MEA detailed the event, \"The swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Council of Ministers following the General Elections 2024 is scheduled on 09 June 2024. On the occasion, leaders from India's neighbourhood and Indian Ocean region have been cordially invited as distinguished guests. In addition to participating in the swearing-in ceremony, the leaders will attend a banquet hosted by President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan the same evening. The visit of the leaders to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his third consecutive term is in keeping with the highest priority accorded by India to its 'Neighbourhood First' policy and 'SAGAR' vision.\"India's immediate neighbours, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, as well as its south-western maritime neighbour, the Maldives, and Indian Ocean island nations Mauritius and Seychelles, demonstrate strong regional ties and cooperation. Mauritius has a significant population of Indian origin, further highlighting the close relations.The invitation extended to Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is particularly significant given recent tensions. Relations between India and the Maldives had deteriorated due to Muizzu's perceived pro-China stance. However, recent efforts to mend relations have been noted, with Modi thanking Muizzu for his congratulatory message, leading to the invitation being extended and accepted.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/leaders-in-india-neighbourhood-arrive-for-modi-swearing-in-ceremony-898021", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/03/31/1081925-narendramodi.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:55:18", "author": "DC Correspondent", "authors": ["DC Correspondent"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.347}

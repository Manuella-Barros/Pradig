Christopher Massey, principal lecturer for modern British history and politics at Teesside University, warned the Triple Lock Plus will tackle a \"looming problem\" for many older Brits. He told the Daily Express after Rishi Sunak's Triple Lock Plus policy announcement this weekend: \"Due to the Conservative\u2019s decision to freeze the tax-free personal allowance in 2022 until 2027/28, it is likely the full new state pension will overtake the personal allowance in a matter of years under the existing triple lock.\" He said: \"The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that this new policy will take 750,000 pensioners out of income tax altogether next year. The triple lock plus, if enacted, would cost an additional \u00a32.4billion a year by 2030. Clearly, the existing triple lock has its merits. It has provided pensioners with the security that their state pension earnings, in real terms, will not be negatively impacted by inflation, or outstripped by wage growth. \"However, the policy is not without cost. The triple lock has added \u00a311billion to public spending since its inception, compared to a single, or double lock using either prices or earnings. Happily, pensioners are living longer and healthier lives, but alongside the triple lock, this also means that the cost of the state pension continues to increase.\" Mr Massey said: \"A potential solution to these problems would be to guarantee that the state pension would rise by at least inflation, with a future overall target level provided as a percentage of median earnings. This would take away uncertainty for pensioners and for the public purse but would also mean breaking the triple lock.\" For individual pensioners, it would be worth around \u00a3100 in 2025 according to the Tories, and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension.", "summary": "Christopher Massey, principal lecturer for modern British history and politics at Teesside University, warned the Triple Lock Plus will tackle a &quot;looming problem&quot; for many older Brits.", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/thousands-uk-households-warned-being-29257778", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29257803.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_hmrc.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:13:40", "author": "James Rodger,Nicholas Dawson", "authors": ["James Rodger", "Nicholas Dawson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.071}

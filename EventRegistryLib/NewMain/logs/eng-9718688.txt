The decision means she would face certain arrest if she sets foot in the country.Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal.

in an Arctic penal colony in February and said she will continue the fight for what Navalny called the \u201cbeautiful Russia of the future\u201d.\n\nWriting on X on Tuesday, Navalnaya, an economist, told her supporters to focus not on the court order against her, but on the battle against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cWhen you write about this, please don\u2019t forget to write the

including US President Joe Biden in San Francisco.\n\nThe US-based non-profit group Human Rights Foundation named Navalnaya its chairwoman last week, and she said she would use the new role to step up her the struggle waged by her husband against Putin.\n\n\u201cWe will take on board everything that can be useful to fight Putin, to fight for the beautiful Russia of the future,\u201d Navalnaya said

galvanised mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country when he was poisoned before defiantly returning to Moscow with him in 2021, knowing he would be jailed.\n\nFollowing his death, Navalnaya vowed to take up her late husband\u2019s work and has lobbied against Putin\u2019s government from abroad.\n\nDuring Russian elections in March, Navalnaya called for mass protests against

Her spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, described the court's ruling as a recognition of her \"merits.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted on X that Ms. Navalnaya is carrying on her husband's legacy and denounced the Moscow court's ruling as \"an arrest warrant against the desire for freedom and democracy.\"\n\nRussian authorities haven't specified the charges against Navalnaya. They appear to relate to authorities designating Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption as an extremist organization. The 2021 court ruling that outlawed Navalny's group forced his close associates and team members to leave Russia.\n\nA number of journalists have been jailed on similar charges in recent months in relation to their coverage of Navalny.\n\nThe Kremlin's crackdown on opposition activists, independent journalists and ordinary Russians critical of it has intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Navalnaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Navalnaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial in absentia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_Vladimir_Putin_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to Vladimir Putin in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penal colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexei_Navalny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poisoning of Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nerve agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira_Yarmysh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kira Yarmysh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/nrxk8a/article68387673.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Russia_Crackdown_93826.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718688", "eventUri": "eng-9718688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Founded by Navalny in 2011 with the goal of exposing Russian government corruption, the nonprofit was branded an \"extremist organization\" by Moscow a decade later. Navalnaya sits on its advisory board.\n\nVolkov added that the order was \"quite a recognition of Yulia's determination to continue Alexei's fight.\"\n\nNavalny, long Putin's fiercest critic, died in a remote Arctic penal colony in February after months of reported psychological and physical abuse. He was arrested after flying into Russia with Navalnaya in 2021 -- a defiant return that followed his near-fatal poisoning with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok the previous year.\n\nCollared on criminally charges that were internationally condemned as trumped-up, Navalny was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. His sentence was later extended by 19 years.\n\nNavalny's collapse and subsequent death sparked an international furor and a fresh round of sanctions against Russia. But Navalnaya cautioned European leaders soon after that economic penalties would not be enough.\n\n\"If you really want to defeat Putin, you have to become an innovator,\" she said in a speech to European Parliament in Strasbourg, France in late February. \"You have to stop being boring. You cannot hurt Putin with another resolution or another set of sanctions that is no different from the previous ones.\"\n\nShe and her two children did not attend Navalny's funeral in Russia over fears they could be arrested.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied any involvement in his death, but Navalnaya and her allies have repeatedly accused Putin of orchestrating his calculated murder.\n\nNavalnaya has vowed to continue her husband's fight, promising the European Parliament she would do her best \"to make his dream come true.\" She was elected the new chair of the Human Rights Foundation earlier this month, and has been at work on his posthumous memoir, due out in October.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Navalnaya held the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, responsible for her husband's death.\n\nIn Russia, the label \"extremist\" is routinely applied to dissident or independent civic groups by courts, which typically carry out the wishes of the Kremlin in political cases.\n\nFollowing Navalny's death, Navalnaya lives in an undisclosed location outside Russia with the couple's two children. Writing on the X social media platform on Tuesday she told her supporters not to be distracted by the court order against her, but to focus on the broader campaign against Putin.\n\n\"When you write about this, please don't forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,\" Navalnaya wrote.\n\n\"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cosy cell with a TV, but in Russia - in the same (penal) colony and the same 2 by 3 metre cell in which he killed Alexei.\"\n\nNavalny was serving a 19-year prison sentence in the Russian Arctic for his leading role in opposition to Putin. In August 2020 he fell violently ill on a Russian internal flight, as a result of poisoning with the nerve agent novichok. He was evacuated to Germany for emergency medical care and eventually recovered. On 17 January 2021, Navalny returned to Russia by plane from Germany and was detained on landing in Moscow.\n\nThree days after Navalny's death in custody, the 47-year-old Navalnaya took on his mantle of leadership, broadcasting a nine-minute video message vowing to continue his resistance to Putin's dictatorial rule.\n\n\"I will continue Alexei Navalny's work ... I want to live in a free Russia, I want to build a free Russia,\" she said in the video. \"I call on you to stand with me. To share not only grief and endless pain ... I ask you to share with me the rage. The fury, anger, hatred for those who dare to kill our future.\"\n\nNavalnaya, an economist, accused the Russian state of poisoning her husband with the nerve agent novichok and hiding his body, blocking access until traces of the poison wore away.\n\nSince taking up the opposition leadership in February, Navalnaya has met a succession of world leaders, including Joe Biden. Last week, a US-based advocacy group, the Human Rights Foundation, named her as its chair, and she said she would use the position to step up the struggle with Putin.\n\nDuring Russian elections in March this year, Navalnaya called for mass protests against Putin by forming long queues at midday, overwhelming polling stations in a campaign that came to be known as \"noon against Putin\".\n\nNavalnaya was a close confidante to her husband and regularly consulted him on his political campaigns and opposition movement. But she is a reluctant public figure and the relentless pressure on the opposition has made it difficult for Navalny's movement to regain momentum after his death.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the family of Vladimir Kara-Murza, another top critic of Putin, said that he had disappeared in a Russian prison. Supporters said that Kara-Murza, who suffers from complications of poisoning, had last been seen by his lawyers on 2 July. He was reported transferred to a prison hospital on 4 July and has since been held incommunicado. \"In the wake of the murder of Alexei Navalny in detention, there are now growing fears that Kara-Murza's life is in danger,\" wrote the Free Russia foundation.\n\nKara-Murza is serving a 25-year prison sentence for treason and other charges that he has said were motivated by his criticism of Putin. Days after Navalny's death, Russian journalists warned that Kara-Murza could die if he was held in a Russian prison.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty Images via CNN Newsource\n\nA court in Moscow has ordered Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, to be arrested in absentia, her spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\nThe Basmanny District Court in Moscow accused Navalnaya, who now lives outside Russia, of \"participation in an extremist organization,\" her spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said in a post on social media. She has also been added to an international wanted list, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nIn addition, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to detain Navalnaya. The period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory, according to a press release. Navalnaya does not live in Russia.\n\nAlexey Navalny died on February 16 in the penal colony in Siberia where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August.\n\nHe was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he had always denied and claimed were politically motivated.\n\nNavalny was Russia's highest-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Putin, who has been in power for nearly a quarter of a century, at great personal risk. His death came weeks before the country's presidential elections scheduled to begin nationwide on March 15, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power.\n\n'Putin is a murderer'\n\nNavalny's death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks.\n\nHe returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival Navalny was swiftly arrested - on charges he dismissed as politically motivated - and spent the rest of his life in prison.\n\nHis wife, Yulia Navalnaya, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin in February of being responsible for his death and indicated she would pick up her husband's mantle, for a \"happy, beautiful Russia.\"\n\nNavalnaya posted an eight-minute video on her dead husband's social media outlets, saying Putin \"killed the father of my children, Putin took away the most precious thing that was my closest and most beloved person.\"\n\nShe said Russian authorities were \"hiding\" Navalny's body in an attempt to disguise the cause of his death - \"lying pathetically\" and waiting for \"traces of another of Putin's Novichoks to disappear.\"\n\nThe Kremlin rejected any allegations of involvement in Navalny's death.\n\nReacting to the court's decision on Tuesday, Navalnaya reiterated claims of Putin's involvement in the death of her husband.\n\n\"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia - in the same colony and the same 2 by 3 meter cell in which he killed Alexey,\" she said in a social media post.\n\n\"Oh, won't there be the usual procedure? A foreign agent, then the opening of a criminal case, then an arrest?! When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

He was imprisoned after being convicted of various trumped-up charges when he returned to Russia after a near-fatal attempt to poison him in August 2020.\n\nNavalnaya has repeatedly accused President Vladimir Putin of Russia of killing her husband and has vowed to continue his opposition work.

Although she avoided any overt political role while her husband was alive, Navalnaya has long led the advisory board of his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nThe foundation, which itself was slapped with the \"extremist\" label and now operates as an international organization from exile in Lithuania, has repeatedly embarrassed Putin and other senior Kremlin officials by chronicling the estates, yachts and other financial assets that they have acquired while in office.\n\nThe order to arrest Navalnaya came from the Investigative Committee, and the court statement said her name would be placed on an international wanted list. Navalnaya left Russia in 2021. She would be subject to arrest if she ever returns to Russia, the statement said.\n\nNavalnaya reacted to the court decision with a slightly mocking tone, noting in a post on the social platform X that the court had jumped right to the \"extremist\" label without the usual interim steps like \"foreign agent.\"\n\n\"When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,\" Navalnaya wrote. \"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia -- in the same colony and the same two-by-three-meter cell in which he killed Alexei.\"\n\nNavalnaya announced in April that she was helping to edit a manuscript that her husband had written during his time in prison.

He was imprisoned after being convicted of various trumped-up charges when he returned to Russia after a near-fatal attempt to poison him in August 2020.\n\nNavalnaya has repeatedly accused President Vladimir Putin of Russia of killing her husband and has vowed to continue his opposition work. She has become an outspoken critic of Russia's war in Ukraine, using episodes like a Russian missile hitting a children's hospital in Kyiv on Monday to blame Putin and the Kremlin for the bloodshed.\n\nThe statement from the Basmanny District Court's press office announcing the arrest order did not spell out the reason for the charges, but it appeared to be linked to her role in helping to run the Navalny opposition organization. Although she avoided any overt political role while her husband was alive, Navalnaya has long led the advisory board of his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nThe foundation, which itself was slapped with the \"extremist\" label and now operates as an international organization from exile in Lithuania, has repeatedly embarrassed Putin and other senior Kremlin officials by chronicling the estates, yachts and other financial assets that they have acquired while in office.\n\nThe order to arrest Navalnaya came from the Investigative Committee, and the court statement said her name would be placed on an international wanted list. Navalnaya would be subject to arrest if she ever returns to Russia, the statement said.\n\nNavalnaya reacted to the court decision with a slightly mocking tone, noting in a post on the social platform X that the court had jumped right to the \"extremist\" label without the usual interim steps like \"foreign agent.\"\n\n\"When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,\" Navalnaya wrote. \"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia -- in the same colony and the same two-by-three-meter cell in which he killed Alexei.\"\n\nNavalnaya announced in April that she was helping to edit a manuscript that her husband had written during his time in prison. The book, which is about his political career, is expected to be released in the United States and elsewhere in October.\n\nThis month, she also became chair of the Human Rights Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes human rights, succeeding Garry Kasparov, the Russian chess grandmaster, who just completed a three-year term.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Navalnaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Navalnaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penal colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Corruption_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Corruption Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_foreign_agent_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian foreign agent law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garry Kasparov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_Committee_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investigative Committee of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-09T155644Z_1871560592_RC2Q36A1K0AE_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-COURT-NAVALNAYA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718688", "eventUri": "eng-9718688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 472, "textEnd": 483}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Hundreds have faced criminal charges over protests and remarks condemning the war in Ukraine, and thousands have been fined or briefly jailed.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Posthumous memoir by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to be published Oct. 22 UN rights chief calls on Russia to stop repressing independent voices after Navalny's death Navalny's mother brings flowers to his grave a day after thousands attended his funeral in Moscow Thousands defy Kremlin to bid farewell as Alexei Navalny is laid to rest\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nBiden unveils $1.7 billion to boost EV production at U.S. auto factories filed under: Alexei Navalny Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pressherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Navalnaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Navalnaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_Vladimir_Putin_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to Vladimir Putin in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Gallen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Gallen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Gallen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_City_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow City Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexei_Navalny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poisoning of Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira_Yarmysh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kira Yarmysh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/Russia_Crackdown_93826_06e58e-1720710565.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718688", "eventUri": "eng-9718688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-22", "textStart": 3126, "textEnd": 3133}], "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Navalnaya, the widow of Aleksei A. Navalny, who was a key figure in the country's political opposition, accusing her of \"participating in an extremist community.\"\n\nThe court order against Ms. Navalnaya, who left Russia in 2021, comes five months after her husband died under murky circumstances in a harsh Russian penal colony. He was imprisoned after being convicted of various trumped-up charges when he returned to Russia after a near-fatal attempt to poison him in August 2020.\n\nMs. Navalnaya has repeatedly accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of murdering her husband and has vowed to continue his opposition work. She has become an outspoken critic of Russia's war in Ukraine, using episodes like a Russian missile hitting a children's hospital in Kyiv on Monday to blame Mr. Putin and the Kremlin for the bloodshed.\n\nThe statement from the Basmanny District Court's press office announcing the arrest order did not spell out the reason for the charges, but it appeared to be linked to her role in helping to run the Navalny opposition organization. Although she avoided any overt political role while her husband was alive, Ms. Navalnaya has long led the advisory board of his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nThe foundation, which itself was slapped with the \"extremist\" label and now operates as an international organization from exile in Lithuania, has repeatedly embarrassed Mr. Putin and other senior Kremlin officials by chronicling the estates, yachts and other financial assets that they have acquired while in office.\n\nThe order to arrest Ms. Navalnaya came from the Investigative Committee, and the court statement said her name would be placed on an international wanted list. Ms. Navalnaya left Russia in 2021. She would be subject to arrest if she ever returns to Russia, the statement said.\n\nMs. Navalnaya reacted to the court decision with a slightly mocking tone, noting in a post on the X social media platform that the court had jumped right to the \"extremist\" label without the usual interim steps like \"foreign agent.\"\n\n\"When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,\" Ms. Navalnaya wrote. \"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia -- in the same colony and the same two-by-three-meter cell in which he killed Aleksei.\"\n\nMs. Navalnaya announced in April that she was helping to edit a manuscript that her husband had written during his time in prison. The book, which is about his political career, is expected to be released in the United States and elsewhere in October.\n\nThis month, she also became chairwoman of the Human Rights Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes human rights, succeeding Garry Kasparov, the Russian chess grandmaster, who just completed a three-year term.\n\nMilana Mazaeva contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial in absentia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penal colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Corruption_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Corruption Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garry Kasparov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_Committee_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investigative Committee of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/09/multimedia/09russia-Navalnaya-1-pwzg/09russia-Navalnaya-1-pwzg-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718688", "eventUri": "eng-9718688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 539, "textEnd": 550}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

She has also been added to an international wanted list, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nAlexey Navalny died on February 16 in the penal colony in Siberia where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August.\n\nHe was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he had always denied and claimed were politically motivated.\n\nNavalny was Russia's highest-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Putin, who has been in power for nearly a quarter of a century, at great personal risk. His death came weeks before the country's presidential elections scheduled to begin nationwide on March 15, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power.\n\n'Putin is a murderer'\n\nNavalny's death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks.\n\nHe returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent.

Yulia Navalnaya's name has also been included in an international wanted list, CNN reported, citing Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nAdditionally, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of Russia to detain Navalnaya. According to a press release, the period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory. It is pertinent to note here that Navalnaya does not reside in Russia.\n\nOn February 16, Alexey Navalny died in the penal colony in Siberia, where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of causing an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August, according to CNN report.\n\nHe was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges. He had denied the allegations and called it politically motivated.\n\nNavalny was Russia's high-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin. His death came weeks before Russia's presidential elections that were scheduled to begin on March 15.\n\nEarlier in February, Yulia Navalnaya had accused Putin of being responsible for her husband's death and hinted that she would pick up her husband's mantle, for a \"happy, beautiful Russia,\" CNN reported.\n\nIn March, a Russian court rejected a lawsuit by late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, alleging that the Kremlin critic had received \"inadequate medical care\" in the Arctic penal colony where he died, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nIvan Zhdanov, head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was started by Navalny, said on the court in the town of Labytnangi turned down the lawsuit because it said only Nalvany could make the complaint himself.\n\n\"Alexei filed lawsuits many times for failure to provide medical care in the colonies,\" Zhdanov wrote on the Telegram app. \"Now that he has been killed, they deny his family's claim with mocking language.\"\n\nNavalny's family and supporters have accused the Russian President of being responsible for his death, an accusation rejected by the Kremlin, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nNavalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said that the court had rejected the lawsuit because it would have meant disclosing video and other information about the circumstances of his death.\n\nRussian prison authorities claimed that the Kremlin critic had fallen unconscious and died on February 16 after a walk outside the \"Polar Wolf\" prison where he was serving a three-decade sentence. His death certificate stated that he had died of 'natural causes'.\n\nLyudmila travelled to the Arctic city of Salekhard, 2,000 km from Moscow, shortly after the former opposition leader's death, where she said investigators refused to release his body from a local morgue until she agreed to bury him without a public funeral, as reported by Al Jazeera.\n\nThousands lined the church perimeter for his short funeral ceremony in Moscow, then went to the cemetery to lay flowers, defying the Kremlin's warnings against large gatherings.

She has been charged with being part of an extremist group, it said.\n\nThe court \"upheld a motion [submitted] by investigators and ordered [Navalnaya] to be put into custody for two months,\" the statement published on Telegram said. This would begin from the moment of her extradition to Russia or if she is detained within the country, it added.\n\nThe court said Navalnaya had \"evaded\" law enforcement authorities. Under Russian law, membership in an extremist organization is punishable with a fine of between 300,000 and 600,000 rubles ($3,450 and $6,900) or up to six years behind bars.\n\nThe court's official statement did not elaborate on which specific actions taken by Navalnaya had led to the charges, only that she had participated in an \"extremist community.\" The Russian news agency Interfax reported, citing sources, that her case is related to her participation in structures founded by her late husband.\n\nSeveral organizations created by Navalny, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), have been designated extremist in Russia in recent years. The opposition figure was imprisoned in 2021 for violating the terms of an earlier suspended sentence.\n\nHe was handed an additional nine-year sentence in early 2022 for contempt of court and a second fraud conviction. In August 2023, he was sentenced to an additional 19 years on multiple extremism-related charges including creating an extremist group, endorsing extremism, financing such activities, and luring minors into them, as well as rehabilitating Nazi ideology.\n\nRussian courts had previously issued similar arrest warrants against a number of Navalny's allies, including his former right-hand man, Leonid Volkov, who had earlier headed the FBK, as well as the organization's current head, Maria Pevchikh. None of them are currently in Russia.\n\nNavalnaya herself also left Russia back in 2021 together with her children after the arrest of her husband. She has lived abroad ever since. In March 2024, she pledged to continue her husband's work.\n\nNavalny died at a penal colony in February while serving his sentence. The prison authorities said the 47-year-old suddenly fell ill after a walk and collapsed, and efforts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. The FBK stated that the death certificate provided to Navalny's mother said he had died of natural causes.", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Poland Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Navalnaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Navalnaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Corruption_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Corruption Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian ruble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Pevchikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Pevchikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Volkov_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonid Volkov (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penal colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspended sentence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfax", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interfax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1720556114.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718688", "eventUri": "eng-9718688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Basmanny District Court in Moscow accused Navalnaya of \"participation in an extremist organization,\" her spokesperson Kira Yarmysh announced in a post on social media. Yulia Navalnaya's name has also been included in an international wanted list, CNN reported, citing Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nAdditionally, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of Russia to detain Navalnaya. According to a press release, the period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory. It is pertinent to note here that Navalnaya does not reside in Russia. On February 16, Alexey Navalny died in the penal colony in Siberia, where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of causing an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August, according to CNN report.\n\nHe was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges. He had denied the allegations and called it politically motivated. Navalny was Russia's high-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin. His death came weeks before Russia's presidential elections that were scheduled to begin on March 15.\n\nEarlier in February, Yulia Navalnaya had accused Putin of being responsible for her husband's death and hinted that she would pick up her husband's mantle, for a \"happy, beautiful Russia,\" CNN reported. In March, a Russian court rejected a lawsuit by late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, alleging that the Kremlin critic had received \"inadequate medical care\" in the Arctic penal colony where he died, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nIvan Zhdanov, head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was started by Navalny, said on the court in the town of Labytnangi turned down the lawsuit because it said only Nalvany could make the complaint himself. \"Alexei filed lawsuits many times for failure to provide medical care in the colonies,\" Zhdanov wrote on the Telegram app. \"Now that he has been killed, they deny his family's claim with mocking language.\"\n\nNavalny's family and supporters have accused the Russian President of being responsible for his death, an accusation rejected by the Kremlin, Al Jazeera reported. Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said that the court had rejected the lawsuit because it would have meant disclosing video and other information about the circumstances of his death.\n\nRussian prison authorities claimed that the Kremlin critic had fallen unconscious and died on February 16 after a walk outside the \"Polar Wolf\" prison where he was serving a three-decade sentence. His death certificate stated that he had died of 'natural causes'. Lyudmila travelled to the Arctic city of Salekhard, 2,000 km from Moscow, shortly after the former opposition leader's death, where she said investigators refused to release his body from a local morgue until she agreed to bury him without a public funeral, as reported by Al Jazeera.\n\nThousands lined the church perimeter for his short funeral ceremony in Moscow, then went to the cemetery to lay flowers, defying the Kremlin's warnings against large gatherings.

Yulia Navalnaya's name has also been included in an international wanted list, CNN reported, citing Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden Ready To Serve US if Elected: White House Press Secretary Says 'It Was Incorrectly Assumed and Insinuated That President Was Being Treated for Parkinson's'.\n\nAdditionally, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of Russia to detain Navalnaya. According to a press release, the period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory. It is pertinent to note here that Navalnaya does not reside in Russia.\n\nOn February 16, Alexey Navalny died in the penal colony in Siberia, where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of causing an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August, according to CNN report.\n\nAlso Read | Modi Austria Visit: Chancellor Karl Nehammer Hosts PM Narendra Modi for Private Engagement in Vienna; PM Says 'Looking Forward for Our Discussions' (See Pics).\n\nHe was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges. He had denied the allegations and called it politically motivated.\n\nNavalny was Russia's high-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin. His death came weeks before Russia's presidential elections that were scheduled to begin on March 15.\n\nEarlier in February, Yulia Navalnaya had accused Putin of being responsible for her husband's death and hinted that she would pick up her husband's mantle, for a \"happy, beautiful Russia,\" CNN reported.\n\nIn March, a Russian court rejected a lawsuit by late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, alleging that the Kremlin critic had received \"inadequate medical care\" in the Arctic penal colony where he died, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nIvan Zhdanov, head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was started by Navalny, said on the court in the town of Labytnangi turned down the lawsuit because it said only Nalvany could make the complaint himself.\n\n\"Alexei filed lawsuits many times for failure to provide medical care in the colonies,\" Zhdanov wrote on the Telegram app. \"Now that he has been killed, they deny his family's claim with mocking language.\"\n\nNavalny's family and supporters have accused the Russian President of being responsible for his death, an accusation rejected by the Kremlin, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nNavalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said that the court had rejected the lawsuit because it would have meant disclosing video and other information about the circumstances of his death.\n\nRussian prison authorities claimed that the Kremlin critic had fallen unconscious and died on February 16 after a walk outside the \"Polar Wolf\" prison where he was serving a three-decade sentence. His death certificate stated that he had died of 'natural causes'.\n\nLyudmila travelled to the Arctic city of Salekhard, 2,000 km from Moscow, shortly after the former opposition leader's death, where she said investigators refused to release his body from a local morgue until she agreed to bury him without a public funeral, as reported by Al Jazeera.\n\nThousands lined the church perimeter for his short funeral ceremony in Moscow, then went to the cemetery to lay flowers, defying the Kremlin's warnings against large gatherings.

Navalnaya, who is currently abroad, has become a target of Russian authorities, marking a significant escalation in the government's crackdown on dissent.\n\nThe warrant was issued as Navalnaya allegedly evaded authorities during a preliminary investigation, prompting the court to declare her wanted, according to the Moscow courts' press service. The case against her, detailed in court documents, involves accusations related to her involvement in videos aimed at discrediting the government and fundraising for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, labeled extremist by Russian authorities.\n\nNavalnaya, reacting to the news, questioned the predictability of the situation, sarcastically alluding to the sequence of events involving labeling individuals as foreign agents, initiating criminal cases, and eventually leading to arrests.\n\nRecently appointed head of the Human Rights Foundation, Navalnaya had expressed determination to carry forward her late husband Alexei Navalny's legacy, emphasizing the continuity of their efforts despite the challenges. In interviews, including one with \"Time\" magazine where she was recognized among the world's most influential people, she vowed to uphold the fight against the Russian government, seeking to inspire hope among the populace.\n\nNavalnaya, in her advocacy efforts, has been vocal internationally, urging Western leaders to withhold recognition of Vladimir Putin as Russia's legitimate president.

(Gian Ehrenzeller/Keystone via AP)\n\nIn a display of defiance by Russia's largely obliterated political opposition, Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has called for President Vladimir Putin to be held accountable for her husband's death, and lawyers for jailed Putin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza demanded that he be released from prison because of his failing health.\n\nA Russian court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of Navalnaya -- an unlikely prospect given that she no longer lives in Russia and has not returned to the country since her husband died suddenly in an Arctic prison in February.\n\nNavalnaya has accused Putin personally of murdering her husband and repeated that charge in responding to her arrest order.\n\n\"When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,\" Navalnaya posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia -- in the same colony and the same 2-by-3-meter cell in which he killed Alexei,\" she added.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied that Putin had any role in Navalny's death, and Russian authorities issued a death certificate that cited natural causes.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Kara-Murza, a prominent critic of Putin and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post who is serving a 25-year jail sentence for treason, said on Wednesday they had finally been able to visit him after six days in which he could not be reached following his transfer to a prison hospital.\n\nThe lawyers called for Kara-Murza to be released from prison in light of his precarious health.\n\nNavalnaya is unlikely to ever end up in a Russia jail. But the decision to issue the arrest warrant on the same day that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was visiting Moscow for a state visit sent a loud message to Putin's critics, including in Washington.\n\nUnlike President Joe Biden, who condemned Navalny's death and proclaimed Putin to be responsible for it, Modi said nothing at the time. Asked about Navalny's death, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata political party reiterated India's close relations with Russia and also that India had expressed opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe arrest order accused Navalnaya of participating in an \"extremist\" group -- her husband's political and anti-corruption organization -- and it demonstrated the Kremlin's continuing focus on Navalny, who had become Putin's nemesis and most formidable opponent, even months after his death at age 47.\n\nNavalny in 2020 survived a poisoning attack carried out by Russian agents using an internationally banned chemical weapon, but he was arrested upon his return to Russia in January 2021 following his recovery in a Berlin hospital. He was held mostly in punitive isolation cells as the authorities added new charges and criminal cases against him. Ultimately, he was transferred to the Polar Wolf prison colony near the Arctic Circle, where he died in February.\n\nNavalnaya had been her husband's confidante and closest adviser for years but kept a low public profile, publicly stating that she was focused on their two children. But she stepped dramatically into the spotlight mere hours after the news of her husband's death, giving a surprise speech to world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference.\n\n\"I want Putin and everyone around him, Putin's friends, his government, to know that they will bear responsibility for what they have done to our country, to my family and to my husband. And this day will come very soon,\" she said.\n\nDays later, she released a video message urging Navalny's supporters not to give up in the struggle against Putin's authoritarian rule in hopes of maintaining the momentum of Navalny's movement. She said she would take up the mantle as leader of that effort.\n\n\"I will continue Alexei Navalny's work. ... I want to live in a free Russia. I want to build a free Russia,\" she said. \"I ask you to share with me the rage. The fury, anger, hatred for those who dare to kill our future.\"\n\nA statement from the Basmanny court in Moscow did not specify the full nature of charges, but they appeared to be linked to a 2021 ruling that declared three organizations set up by her husband to be \"extremist,\" including the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which published multiple investigations into the illicit wealth and corrupt schemes of members of Putin's close circle.\n\nThose investigations, some recounted in dramatic videos viewed millions of times on YouTube, prompted thousands of Russians to take part in protests over the years.\n\nRussian authorities have slapped the \"extremist\" label on numerous independent movements and nongovernmental organizations, suggesting that they seek to undermine the country's \"constitutional order\" -- a thinly veiled excuse to dismantle organizations viewed as posing a challenged to Putin's quarter-century rule.\n\nSince Navalny's funeral in March, which his widow was not able to attend, Navalnaya has met with multiple world leaders, including Biden. In July, she was elected chair of the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes human rights worldwide.\n\nThe lawyers for Kara-Murza said that Russian authorities prevented them from visiting him in a hospital where he had been taken. Kara-Murza, who suffers from health complications following two poisonings, is imprisoned in the Siberian city of Omsk, more than 1,300 miles from Moscow.\n\nOne of his lawyers, Vadim Prohkorov, called again for Kara-Murza's release from the prison colony because of his precarious medical condition.\n\n\"Vladimir Kara-Murza's health condition is currently relatively stable. But he suffers from a serious chronic disease that prevents him from serving his sentence in a correctional colony -- polyneuropathy,\" Prokhorov wrote in a Facebook post. The disease is a malfunction of peripheral nerves throughout the body.\n\nIn one of Kara-Murza's most recent letters from prison, he wrote to a friend: \"To me, as a historian, the present time in general reminds me very much of the 'gloomy seven years' of the end of Nicholas I's reign. The darkest time.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Navalnaya", "type":

This would begin from the moment of her extradition to Russia or if she is detained within the country, it added.\n\nThe court said Navalnaya had \"evaded\" law enforcement authorities. Under Russian law, membership in an extremist organization is punishable with a fine of between 300,000 and 600,000 rubles ($3,450 and $6,900) or up to six years behind bars.\n\nThe court's official statement did not elaborate on which specific actions taken by Navalnaya had led to the charges, only that she had participated in an \"extremist community.\" The Russian news agency Interfax reported, citing sources, that her case is related to her participation in structures founded by her late husband.\n\nSeveral organizations created by Navalny, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), have been designated extremist in Russia in recent years. The opposition figure was imprisoned in 2021 for violating the terms of an earlier suspended sentence.\n\nHe was handed an additional nine-year sentence in early 2022 for contempt of court and a second fraud conviction. In August 2023, he was sentenced to an additional 19 years on multiple extremism-related charges including creating an extremist group, endorsing extremism, financing such activities, and luring minors into them, as well as rehabilitating Nazi ideology.\n\nRussian courts had previously issued similar arrest warrants against a number of Navalny's allies, including his former right-hand man, Leonid Volkov, who had earlier headed the FBK, as well as the organization's current head, Maria Pevchikh. None of them are currently in Russia.\n\nNavalnaya herself also left Russia back in 2021 together with her children after the arrest of her husband. She has lived abroad ever since. In March 2024, she pledged to continue her husband's work.\n\nNavalny died at a penal colony in February while serving his sentence. The prison authorities said the 47-year-old suddenly fell ill after a walk and collapsed, and efforts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.

But the decision to issue the arrest warrant on the same day that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was visiting Moscow for a state visit sent a loud message to Putin's critics, including in Washington.\n\nUnlike President Biden, who condemned Navalny's death and proclaimed Putin to be responsible for it, Modi said nothing at the time. Asked about Navalny's death, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata political party reiterated India's close relations with Russia and also that India had expressed opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe arrest order accused Navalnaya of participating in an \"extremist\" group - her husband's political and anti-corruption organization - and it demonstrated the Kremlin's continuing focus on Navalny, who had become Putin's nemesis and most formidable opponent, even months after his death at age 47.\n\nNavalny in 2020 survived a poisoning attack carried out by Russian agents using an internationally banned chemical weapon, but was arrested upon his return to Russia in January 2021, following his recovery in a Berlin hospital. He was held mostly in punitive isolation cells as the authorities added new charges and criminal cases against him. Ultimately, he was transferred to the Polar Wolf prison colony near the Arctic Circle, where he died in February.\n\nNavalnaya had been her husband's confidante and closest adviser for years but kept a low public profile, publicly stating that she was focused on their two children. But she stepped dramatically into the spotlight mere hours after the news of her husband's death, giving a surprise speech to world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference.\n\n\"I want Putin and everyone around him, Putin's friends, his government, to know that they will bear responsibility for what they have done to our country, to my family and to my husband. And this day will come very soon,\" she said.\n\nDays later, she released a video message urging Navalny's supporters not to give up in the struggle against Putin's authoritarian rule in hopes of maintaining the momentum of Navalny's movement. She said she would take up the mantle as leader of that effort.\n\n\"I will continue Alexei Navalny's work. ... I want to live in a free Russia, I want to build a free Russia,\" she said. \"I ask you to share with me the rage. The fury, anger, hatred for those who dare to kill our future.\"\n\nA statement from the Basmanny court in Moscow did not specify the full nature of charges but they appeared to be linked to a 2021 ruling that declared three organizations set up by her husband to be \"extremist,\" including the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which published multiple investigations into the illicit wealth and corrupt schemes of members of Putin's close circle.\n\nThose investigations, some recounted in dramatic videos viewed millions of times on YouTube, prompted thousands of Russians to take part in protests over the years.\n\nRussian authorities have slapped the \"extremist\" label on numerous independent movements and nongovernmental organizations, suggesting that they seek to undermine the country's \"constitutional order\" - a thinly veiled excuse to dismantle organizations viewed as posing a challenged to Putin's quarter-century rule.\n\nSince Navalny's funeral in March, which his widow was not able to attend, Navalnaya has met with multiple world leaders, including Biden. In July, she was elected chair of the U.S.-based Human Rights Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes human rights worldwide.\n\nThe lawyers for Kara-Murza said that Russian authorities prevented them from visiting him in a hospital where he had been taken. Kara-Murza, who suffers from health complications following two poisonings, is imprisoned in the Siberian city of Omsk, more than 1,300 miles from Moscow.\n\nOne of his lawyers, Vadim Prohkorov, called again for Kara-Murza's release from the prison colony because of his precarious medical condition.\n\n\"Vladimir Kara-Murza's health condition is currently relatively stable. But he suffers from a serious chronic disease that prevents him from serving his sentence in a correctional colony - polyneuropathy,\" Prokhorov wrote in a Facebook post. The disease is a malfunction of peripheral nerves throughout the body.\n\nIn one of Kara-Murza's most recent letters from prison, he wrote to a friend: \"To me, as a historian, the present time in general reminds me very much of the 'gloomy seven years' of the end of Nicholas I's reign. The darkest time.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type":

a number of senior Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden in San Francisco.\n\nOn February 26, the Australian government imposed targeted sanctions and travel bans on a number of Russian officials involved in the mistreatment of Mr Navalny.\n\n\"Australia holds President Putin and the Russian Government responsible for Mr Navalny's treatment and death in custody,\" the Department of

Reuters reports he also said a sailor was wounded.\n\nThe region's port facilities have been regularly attacked by long-range strikes by Moscow.\n\nUkraine's air force claimed it had downed 14 of 20 drones over eight regions during the attack. It also claimed to have prevented three of four Russian missiles from reaching their targets. The claims have not been independently verified.\n\nOn Wednesday morning the Ukrainian air force announced Russian had fired a ballistic missile and four guided air missiles from occupied Crimea, and 20 Shahed drones from the Kursk region inside Russia.\n\nRussian drones attacked energy facilities in Ukraine's Rivne region, the Ukrainian national grid operator said on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe latest attacks come as US president Joe Biden pledged new air defence systems for Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden welcomed Nato member states to a Washington summit warning that \"[Vladimir] Putin wants nothing less, nothing less, than Ukraine's total subjugation ... and to wipe Ukraine off the map. Ukraine can and will stop Putin.\"\n\nMr Biden announced Nato will provide Ukraine with five new strategic air defence systems, the promise coming just a day after a deadly missile strike against a paediatric cancer hospital and other civilian targets.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Washington with the summit expected to focus heavily on helping Kyiv fight Russian aggression in the war in Ukraine.\n\nHe said he would \"fight\" for Nato to strengthen Ukrainian air defences and furnish it with more F-16 fighter jets.\n\nElsewhere, Russia has issued an arrest warrant for Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny and a leading dissident living in exile, imposing a two-month detention order on grounds that she participated in an \"extremist\" group.\n\nThe warrant was issued in absentia by a Moscow court on Tuesday, five months after Mr Navalny died in a Russian Arctic penal colony. Ms Navalnaya held the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, responsible for her husband's death.\n\nIn Russia, the label \"extremist\" is routinely applied to dissident or independent civic groups by courts, which typically carry out the wishes of the Kremlin in political cases.\n\nSince Mr Navalny's death, Ms Navalnaya has lived in an undisclosed location outside Russia with the couple's two children. Writing on the X social media platform on Tuesday she told her supporters not to be distracted by the court order against her, but to focus on the broader campaign against Mr Putin. - Guardian",

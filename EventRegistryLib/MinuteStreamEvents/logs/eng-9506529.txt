The accident, which involved a collision between a car and a truck, occurred on Saturday, April 20.\n\nThe injuries ranged from bumps and bruises to broken bones, according to a source close to the production. Two crew members were taken to the hospital, with one remaining hospitalized as of Tuesday.\n\nThe incident unfolded during a rehearsed scene that unfortunately did not go as planned. According to a studio spokesperson, all safety precautions were reviewed and monitored, yet the sequence led to several injuries ranging from bumps and bruises to broken bones.\n\n\"It was a completely freak accident,\" said a person close to the production. \"It wasn't even a complicated or dangerous stunt,\" they added, highlighting the unpredictable nature of filming even the most well-prepared scenes.\n\nNotably, none of the film's leading stars, including Eddie Murphy, Keke Palmer, and Pete Davidson, were present on the set at the time. The accident was part of a second unit shooting, which typically involves scenes without the principal actors.\n\nDespite the mishap, the studio has emphasized that the well-being of the entire crew and cast remains their highest priority. \"We will continue to insist on the highest industry standards of safety while filming,\" the studio spokesperson asserted.\n\nThe film, directed by Tim Story and featuring an ensemble cast, has been under production in and around Atlanta since February 20. While details of the film's plot remain under wraps, the inclusion of notable names such as Pete Davidson and Eva Longoria has already generated significant buzz.\n\nFortunately, the production of \"The Pickup\" is not expected to face delays due to the accident. However, the incident has prompted the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees to begin an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the accident.\n\n\"We are still gathering facts on what happened and why,\" said a studio spokesperson. \"Our thoughts are with those who are recovering.\"\n\nAs the film industry continues to grapple with the challenges of ensuring safety on sets, this unfortunate event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks involved in the magic of movie-making.

All are expected to recover, the crew member shared.\n\nFor their part, the Amazon MGM Studios rep says that the investigation is still early on but they are committed to ensuring that another incident like this does not happen in the future.\n\n\"We are still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why, but first and foremost our thoughts are with those who are recovering,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\nThey added, \"The well-being of the entire crew and cast is our first priority, and we will continue to insist on the highest industry standards of safety while filming. All safety precautions were reviewed prior to and monitored during the shoot.\"\n\nMurphy, Palmer and Davidson have not released statements in relation to the incident at this time. The film also stars Eva Longoria and Marshawn Lynch.\n\n'The Voice' Season 25: See the Knockout Round Team Rosters\n\nWhat to Know About Bella Hadid's Cowboy Romance With Adan Banuelos", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keke Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Voice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marshawn Lynch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Longoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eva Longoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://media.9news.com/assets/ETONLINE/images/9b0680b1-400a-49a6-8e61-29be07475568/20240424T105004/9b0680b1-400a-49a6-8e61-29be07475568_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506529", "eventUri": "eng-9506529", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 293, "textEnd": 301}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

A studio representative told a newswire on Tuesday that the accident scene of Saturday's schedule in Georgia was rehearsed and that all safety precautions were taken care of. Murphy and the rest of the film's cast, including Keke Palmer and Pete Davidson, were not on set at the time of the accident.\n\nThe injuries ranged from scratches and bruises to shattered bones, according to a person on set. Two crew members were sent to the hospital, and one is supposed to remain there until Tuesday. All are anticipated to fully recover. According to the source, the accident occurred when a truck got locked and collided with a car outside of Atlanta.\n\nThe individual talked with a potal on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly. The person said that it was a complete freak accident. It wasn't even an elaborate or dangerous stunt. The sequence was being shot by a second unit in the production, which often shoots less-important scenes that do not involve the director or main actors. Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as intended, and several crew members were hurt as a result.\n\n\"We are currently gathering information on what happened and why, but our first thoughts are with those who are healing,\" according to a studio representative. The studio did not provide information about the injuries of the crew members who were harmed. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union that represents the majority of film crew personnel, stated in a statement that they were aware of the tragedy and had initiated an investigation, but could not immediately provide any information.\n\nThe film is directed by Tim Story, who previously worked on Barbershop in 2002 and Fantastic Four in 2005. It has been shooting in and around Atlanta since February 20. The release date is yet to be finalised, however the accident is not likely to postpone production.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keke Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbershop (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Theatrical_Stage_Employees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Story", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Story"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/24-04-2024/1200-675-21302062-316-21302062-1713945748558.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506529", "eventUri": "eng-9506529", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 2036, "textEnd": 2047}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The New York Times now says at least half a dozen people who were inside the two cars were taken to the hospital. One remains hospitalized Wednesday after sustaining a back injury.\n\nIn the video (via NYT), you can see an armored truck pulling up alongside an SUV and then swerving into it, leading the cars to drive off the road and into grass. But the armored truck then rolls on top of the SUV, with both vehicles fully flipping before landing upright. The video concludes with a person's body hanging limply out of the armored truck door.\n\nWhile it's unclear the exact cause of the accident, be it human error or vehicle malfunction, a source close to the production told IndieWire that the truck in the video was meant to collide with the SUV as part of the stunt sequence in the film. The SUV was supposed to then veer behind the armored truck, but the sequence did not go as planned.\n\nOSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has opened an investigation into the accident, which took place April 20 outside Atlanta.\n\n\"On April 20, an accident occurred on the set of 'The Pickup' during a rehearsed second unit action sequence. Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as planned and several members of the crew were injured as a result,\" a spokesperson for Amazon MGM Studios said in a statement Tuesday. \"We are still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why, but first and foremost our thoughts are with those who are recovering.

However, the tragic shooting on the set of \"Rust\" is a stark reminder that movie magic is actually based on the very real expertise of a talented cast and crew.\n\nOn Saturday, \"The Pickup,\" an Amazon MGM Studios film directed by Tim Story (\"The Blackening\") and starring Eddie Murphy and Keke Palmer, became the latest production to suffer a major on-set accident. According to the Associated Press, an anonymous source described the incident as a \"freak accident\" that happened during a car crash stunt \"when a truck 'locked up' and hit another vehicle.\"\n\nSeveral crew members reportedly suffered injuries that \"ranged from bumps and bruises to broken bones.\" Two crew members ended up in the hospital, with one still hospitalized as of Tuesday. Neither Murphy nor Palmer were on set during the second unit sequence.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon MGM Studios said the action scene was rehearsed, but \"Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as planned and several members of the crew were injured as a result.\"\n\n\"All safety precautions were reviewed prior to and monitored during the shoot,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs action movies have become Hollywood's most profitable genre, stunt performers and actors have lobbied for years for stunt teams to receive more recognition at awards ceremonies, including The Oscars. When you're watching a \"John Wick\" movie or an \"Avengers\" film, it takes an extremely talented team of stunt people effortlessly working together to create the flawless ballet of action that appears on screen. There's an incredible amount of trust and preparation involved in making these moments seem real.\n\nThe International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the union that represents crew members, said in a statement: \"IATSE is aware of an accident that took place on the Georgia set of The Pickup and have started an inquiry.\"\n\nThis incident is particularly notable as it comes amid IATSE's ongoing negotiations with studios for a new contract.

A truck \"locked up\" and collided with another vehicle, resulting in injuries to multiple crew members.\n\nReports from the set indicate that the injuries ranged from bumps and bruises to more severe afflictions such as broken bones. Two of the injured were promptly hospitalized, with one still under medical supervision days following the incident. It is crucial to note, however, that main cast members, including Murphy and Palmer, were not present during the accident.\n\nAmazon MGM Studios and a spokesperson close to the production have confirmed that the accident occurred despite thorough rehearsals and stringent adherence to safety protocols. This emphasizes the unpredictable nature of film production, where even the most controlled environments can become hazardous without warning.\n\n\"The sequence did not go as planned and several members of the crew were injured as a result. We are still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why, but first and foremost our thoughts are with those who are recovering,\" a studio spokesperson stated. This event has prompted a pause in the filming of \"The Pickup,\" a project that had been in the works around Atlanta since February 20. Directed by Tim Story, known for his work on \"Barbershop\" and \"Fantastic Four,\" the film's already secretive plot and release date are further shrouded by the uncertainty of when production may resume.\n\nThe incident has also sparked an inquiry from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), underlining the ongoing dialogue around the need for elevated safety measures in film production.\n\nAs the film industry and its audience await more details and hope for a speedy recovery for those injured, this accident on the set of \"The Pickup\" serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks involved in bringing cinematic visions to life and the paramount importance of safety protocols.", "source": {"uri": "aceshowbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AceShowbiz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aceshowbiz_team@aceshowbiz.com", "name": "AceShowbiz Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Theatrical_Stage_Employees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Story", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2024/04/25/00223350.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506529", "eventUri": "eng-9506529", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 1655, "textEnd": 1666}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The principal cast was not on set during an accident involving a truck and car during the action sequence. The film is one of several new movies Eddie Murphy is working on.\n\nSeveral crew members were injured on the set of Eddie Murphy's new film The Pickup during an action sequence that went awry on Saturday. The incident, which involved a truck unexpectedly crashing into a car, resulted in injuries ranging from bruises to broken bones, with two individuals being hospitalized. The film, which stars Eddie Murphy, Keke Palmer, and Pete Davidson, was not in active production with the primary cast at the time of the accident. According to reports from the Associated Press, none of the leading actors were present on set.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for Amazon Studios, despite the stunt being rehearsed several times beforehand, something went wrong with the stunt that resulted in several injuries. They said:\n\n\"Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as planned and several members of the crew were injured as a result. We are still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why, but first and foremost our thoughts are with those who are recovering. The well-being of the entire crew and cast is our first priority, and we will continue to insist on the highest industry standards of safety while filming. All safety precautions were reviewed prior to and monitored during the shoot.\"\n\nRelated Eddie Murphy Breaks Prime Video Record Despite Candy Cane Lane's \"Rotten\" Reviews Candy Cane Lane sadly does not seem to be the new Eddie Murphy-led festive favorite that critics and audiences were hoping for.\n\nThe International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), representing the injured crew members, also issued a statement on the matter. They said:\n\nIATSE is aware of an accident that took place on the Georgia set of The Pickup and has started an inquiry.\n\nEddie Murphy Has Several Big Projects on the Horizon Close\n\nAfter several years in the doldrums, Murphy has been back in action thanks in part to a new deal he signed with Amazon Studios, which saw him tapping into the current nostalgic vein of Hollywood movies in the sequel Coming 2 America. While the film did not exactly set the world alight from a review point of view, the film was a huge streaming hit for Prime Video.\n\nLast year, Murphy released the original Christmas movie, Candy Cane Lane to another wave of \"rotten\" reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but a record-breaking viewership. This is not a new trend, and for many streaming releases it doesn't seem to make a difference if the majority of critics and audiences hate the end product, it will still draw a substantial audience.\n\nNext up for the actor is another nostalgic throwback in the form of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, which will stream on Netflix this summer. The fourth entry in the comedy-cop franchise will see Murphy reprising his role as Axel Foley some 30 years after his last outing in 1994. While the franchise seemed to have come to an end with the lowly 11% RT critics rating that Beverly Hills Cop III achieved, absence does make the heart grow fonder - though Coming 2 America suggests that even nostalgia's reach only stretches so far.\n\nRelated Every Eddie Murphy Movie from the 80s, Ranked The 80s proved to be a golden era for comedian and actor Eddie Murphy. Here's a look back at all of his movies from back then.\n\nBeyond his current slate of movies, Murphy was reported last year to be taking on the role of Inspector Clouseau in an animated/live-action hybrid reboot of The Pink Panther, that would see Murphy's bumbling detective teaming up with the titular character in a \"buddy-cop\" story. The film was said to be eyeing up Sonic the Hedgehog's Jeff Fowler to direct, but since its announcement almost a year ago, there has been very little movement on the expected production timeline for the project.\n\nAnother potential project on the horizon is the return of the Shrek franchise. A fifth movie has been discussed many times in the last few years, and while there has been no official word that it will happen, it is expected that Murphy will be back to reprise his role as the loudmouthed Donkey if it does get off the ground.\n\nEddie Muphy's film The Pickup is expected to release on Prime Video in 2025.

The Amazon MGM Studios film, which is titled The Pick Up and also stars Pete Davidson and more, made headlines earlier this week after \"several\" crew members were apparently injured. The studio confirmed that information via a statement and at the time, said that it was \"in the process of gathering facts.\" Now, it's been confirmed that a federal investigation has been launched.\n\nThe inquiry into this matter is being handled by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It was previously reported that the incident occurred while second-unit production on the film was in progress. At the time, the crew was allegedly filming a \"pre-rehearsed\" action sequence, which \"did not go as planned.\" A representative from the U.S. Department of Labor shared new comments with the trade, confirming that the situation is being analyzed:\n\nPer the Associated Press' original report, the incident occurred on Saturday, April 20 on the film's set in Georgia. At the time, a truck was being utilized to shoot a sequence, and it apparently \"locked up\" and hit another vehicle. An unnamed source for the outlet described the ordeal as \"a completely freak accident\" and said that it \"wasn't even a complicated or dangerous stunt.\" Two members of the crew were reportedly taken to the hospital and, as of Tuesday, one remained hospitalized. AP states that bumps, bruises and broken bones were among the injuries suffered by those involved.\n\nEddie Murphy, the other primary members of the cast and director Tim Story were not on set when everything occurred due to this being second-unit. For the moment, it seems that production will not be delayed as well.\n\nThe Pick Up is part of a three-film deal that Eddie Murphy signed with Amazon in 2021, which included Coming 2 America and Christmas movie Candy Cane Lane. Both were widely viewed by Prime Video subscription holders, per the streamer. Plot details have yet to be revealed, but what's known is that it will see Murphy and Pete Davidson part of an ensemble that includes Keke Palmer, Eva Longoria, Andrew Dice Clay, Jack Kesy, Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova and Marshawn Lynch. Described as a heist film, it could fall in line with the action fare present in some of Murphy's best movies.\n\nWith details on the investigation mostly unclear to the general public, it can't be said just how long it might persist. One would assume that some of the findings might be released once it's been completed. It's also unclear how much longer The Pick Up will be filming, and it hasn't been confirmed if it'll secure a release date on the 2024 movie schedule.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_2_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming 2 America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismael_Cruz_C\u00f3rdova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Story", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heist_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heist film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dice_Clay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Dice Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keke Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marshawn Lynch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Longoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eva Longoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kesy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Kesy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wat559VzkbQHepSSwFuuKW-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506529", "eventUri": "eng-9506529", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1057, "textEnd": 1065}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

A studio spokesperson said in a statement to The Associated Press the scene that led to Saturday's wreck in Georgia had been rehearsed and all safety precautions were taken. Neither Murphy nor the film's other stars, including Keke Palmer and Pete Davidson, were on the set at the time. The injuries ranged from bumps and bruises to broken bones, the person close to the production said. Two crew members were taken to the hospital, and one remained hospitalized Tuesday. All are expected to make a full recovery. The crash happened on a location outside of Atlanta when a truck locked up and hit a car, the person said. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. The scene was being shot by a second unit on the production, which generally shoots less-central scenes not involving the director or principal actors. \"Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as planned and several members of the crew were injured as a result. We are still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why,\" a statement to the AP from the studio spokesperson said. The studio did not give details on the injuries or the roles of the crew members who were hurt. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union representing most film crew members, said in a statement to the AP it was aware of the wreck and have begun an inquiry, but could not yet provide further details.\n\nCher, Ozzy Osbourne, Peter Frampton and Mary J. Blige are part of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's class of 2024, along with Dave Matthews Band, Kool & the Gang, Foreigner and A Tribe Called Quest, the hall announced Sunday. The latest crop of stars will officially join the pantheon in a ceremony Oct. 19 at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, where the hall's affiliated museum is also located. Of those artists, four were elevated to the hall on their first nomination: Cher, Foreigner, Frampton and Kool & the Gang. Osbourne was nominated for the first time as a solo act, though he had joined the hall as part of Black Sabbath in 2006. The hall will also honor blues musicians Alexis Korner, John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton with the musical influence award, while Jimmy Buffett, Dionne Warwick, the MC5 and Motown producer and songwriter Norman Whitfield will receive an honor for musical excellence. Suzanne de Passe, a film and television producer who was a longtime executive at Motown, will receive the Ahmet Ertegun Award for nonperformers.\n\nCher accepts the Icon Award at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, Monday, April 1, 2024, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

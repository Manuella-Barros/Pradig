{"id": 232074802, "title": "Election 2024: Molloy in good position as Doohan, Sweeney eliminated in Glenties", "text": "Two independent candidates are the first officially eliminated in Glenties. Anthony Matthew Doohan and Ann Sweeney were eliminated after the second count which has just concluded, which included the distribution of Michael Choilm MacGiolla Easbuig\u2019s surplus of 242 votes. With MacGiolla Easbuig and fellow Independent Michael McClafferty already elected, the race is heating up to confirm the final slots on the six-seat Glenties MD council. Anthony Molloy of Fianna Fail is in a strong position with 1,417 votes, but behind him the final order of the chasing pack is far from clear. Sinn Fein\u2019s Brian Carr and John Sh\u00e9amais \u00d3 Fearraigh are next on 1,029 and 1,004 votes respectively, closely followed by 100% Redress candidate Denis McGee on 937 votes to complete the current top six. Their advantage remains slim over the rest of the field however, with Sinn Fein\u2019s Kellie Rodgers on 843 votes, Independent candidate Jonathan Stewart on 820, and Joseph Molloy of Fine Gael on 773. Doohan\u2019s 108 and Sweeney\u2019s 78 votes will now be distributed in the next count.", "summary": "<p>Two independent candidates are the first officially eliminated in Glenties.

The National Trust owned estate is going to combine its picturesque beauty with the joy of live theatre which you can enjoy alongside a picnic. With a mixture of 14 different shows throughout July and August, there will be timeless theatre classics and even some exciting debuts. These shows, which the National Trust is calling \"captivating twilight shows\" will take place within the surroundings of the parkland. Wimpole Estate is certainly one of the most beautiful locations in Cambridgeshire. Located in Arrington, the estate covers 3,000 acres of parkland and farmland as well as its impressive country house, Wimpole Hall.

All the performances will take place in the evening so that the sunset will happen during the performance. Wimpole's extraordinary summer of outdoor performances kicks off with 'Nightingale' on Friday, July 5. It is an original new ballet based on the life and work of Florence Nightingale, performed by New Creations Collective. Or, if you prefer to be the one doing the dancing, you might prefer the Folk Picnic on July 20, August 2 and August 24. Here you can get up and dance to some talented local musicians with the enchanting melodies of folk music.

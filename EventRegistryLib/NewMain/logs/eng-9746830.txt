It is a day that should be written with golden letters in the nation's history.\n\nWhole country is looking at Telangana with wonder for waiving upto Rs 2 lakh loan of farmers at one go. By doing so, Telangana State created a record, he said.\n\nNo State ever implemented Rs 2 lakh loan waiver for farmers at once in the country and Telangana became a model State in this for the country, he added.\n\nThe whole Congress Party which already fulfilled five of six guarantees promised in the election manifesto today also kept its word on loan waiver of upto Rs 2 lakhs to farmers.\n\nAfter the bifurcation of the State, though the rich Telangana State was governed by the BRS Party, the KCR government could implement Rs one lakh loan waiver scheme over a period of five years in four instalments.\n\nThe BRS which came to power in 2018 in fact could not completely implement Rs 1 lakh loan waiver scheme for farmers even in five years, he said.

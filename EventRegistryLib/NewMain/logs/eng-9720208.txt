NEW YORK (AP) - Former NBA player Jontay Porter is due in court Wednesday to face a federal criminal case tied to the betting scandal that got him banned from the league earlier this year. Court records show the former Toronto Raptors center is scheduled for an arraignment and \"plea agreement hearing.\"\u009d Prosecutors haven't specified the charge or charges, except to say in a brief court document that it's a felony case. Porter's lawyer hasn't responded to messages seeking comment since the court paperwork was filed last week. The attorney has previously said that Porter was cooperating with authorities while being treated for a gambling addiction. Last week's skeletal court filing showed the case against Porter is related to an ongoing prosecution of four other men. The four have been arraigned on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud but haven't yet entered any pleas. Those men are charged with scheming to profit off tips from an NBA player that he was going to exit two games early. They or their relatives used the knowledge to place big-winning bets that the athlete would do poorly in those games, according to a court complaint filed when they were charged in June. The complaint didn't name the player. But it said he had spoken to investigators in hopes of getting a plea deal and sentencing break \"in the event he is criminally charged.\"\u009d According to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off. In a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\"\u009d After tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said. Porter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations. After the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\"\u009d an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\"\u009d from their phones. The NBA's probe found that Porter not only exited at least one game for gamblers' sake but also wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said.

The four have been arraigned on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud but haven't yet entered any pleas.\n\nThose men are charged with scheming to profit off tips from an NBA player that he was going to exit two games early. They or their relatives used the knowledge to place big-winning bets that the athlete would do poorly in those games, according to a court complaint filed when they were charged in June.\n\nThe complaint didn't name the player, but details matched up with an NBA investigation that spurred Porter's banishment from the league this spring. The league found that he gambled on NBA games and gave bettors confidential information about his health.\n\nIn court Wednesday, Porter said he agreed to withdraw early from games to get out from under large gambling debts so he and co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" he said.\n\nPorter is set to be sentenced Dec. 18. He could face from just under three and a half years in prison to a little over four years. He's also likely to be assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution, plus potential fines.\n\nAccording to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off.\n\nIn a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\"\n\nAfter tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said.\n\nPorter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations.\n\nAfter the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\" from their phones.\n\nThe NBA's probe found that Porter not only exited at least one game for gamblers' sake but also wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said.\n\nPorter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games this season, including five starts.

They or their relatives used the knowledge to place big-winning bets that the athlete would do poorly in those games, according to a court complaint filed when they were charged in June.\n\nThe complaint didn't name the player, but details matched up with an NBA investigation that spurred Porter's banishment from the league this spring. The league found that he gambled on NBA games and gave bettors confidential information about his health.\n\nIn court Wednesday, Porter said he agreed to withdraw early from games to get out from under large gambling debts so he and co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPorter is set to be sentenced Dec. 18. He could face from just under three and a half years in prison to a little over four years. He's also likely to be assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution, plus potential fines.\n\nAccording to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off.\n\nIn a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\"\n\nAfter tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said.\n\nPorter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations.\n\nAfter the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\" from their phones.\n\nThe NBA's probe found that Porter not only exited at least one game for gamblers' sake but also wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said.\n\nPorter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games this season, including five starts. He also played in 11 games for the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe 24-year-old's NBA salary was about $410,000.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The league found that he gambled on NBA games and gave bettors confidential information about his health.\n\nIn court Wednesday, Porter said he agreed to withdraw early from games to get out from under large gambling debts so he and co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off.\n\nIn a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\"\n\nAfter tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said.\n\nPorter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations.\n\nAfter the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\" from their phones.\n\nThe NBA's probe found that Porter not only exited at least one game for gamblers' sake but also wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said.\n\nPorter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games this season, including five starts. He also played in 11 games for the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe 24-year-old's NBA salary was about $410,000.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_zalubowski@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "David Zalubowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Sattui_Winery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V.

He is set to be released on a $250,000 bond. Porter's sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 18. Porter could face up to three and half to four years in prison, per Jennifer Peltz of the Associated Press.\n\n\"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" Porter said.\n\nThe issue stemmed from prop bets placed on Porter from Jan. 26 to March 20. NBA officials found that Porter \"disclosed confidential information to sports bettors, limited his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes and bet on NBA games.\"\n\nAccording to the league's initial findings, while traveling with the Toronto Raptors or Raptors 905, the NBA G League affiliate, Porter placed at least 13 bets on NBA games using an associate's online betting account. These bets ranged in size from $15 to $22,000, for a total of $54,094. The total payout from these bets was $76,059, resulting in net winnings of $21,965. None of the bets involved any game in which Porter played. Three of the bets were multi-game parlay bets that included one Raptors game, in which Porter bet that the Raptors would lose. All three bets lost.\n\nMore details on Jontay Porter federal court case\n\nFour other men have been arraigned on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They have yet to enter any pleas. The four men are charged with scheming to profit off tips that an NBA would exit two games early.

They were set at 5.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 0.5 3-pointers. Porter played only four minutes that night before leaving the game with a reaggravation of an eye injury he suffered four days earlier against the Memphis Grizzlies. He hit the under on all of his props. Porter returned to the lineup two days later and played 19 minutes, recording 12 points and seven rebounds.\n\nAnother game in question is the March 20 tilt versus the Phoenix Suns.

He'll be sentenced on Dec. 18 and could face between three-and-a-half to four years in prison.\n\nThe NBA banned Porter from the league earlier this year when he was found to have placed several bets on NBA games, several bets against the Toronto Raptors while on the team roster, and actively removing himself from games so \"under\" bets placed by individuals he owed money to could win.\n\nNews of Porter's role in the sports betting scandal broke in April when the NBA announced its decision to ban him from the league. An NBA investigation found the backup forward/center provided a sports bettor with confidential information, limited his participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and bet on several NBA games.\n\nPorter was found to have bet against the Raptors in a parlay while he traveled, but did not play, with the team earlier this year.\n\nMost concerning, however, was news that broke in June that Porter faked at least two injuries so he could leave games early. He informed several individuals that he owed large gambling debts to about his plan so they could place several large \"under\" bets on his performance.\n\nIn court today, the AP revealed Porter said \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry.\n\nIn addition to potentially serving years in prison, Porter could also be subject to several hefty fines.\n\nAccording to the findings of the NBA investigation earlier this year, Porter placed at least 13 bets on NBA games using an associate's online sports betting account. The bets ranged from $15 to $22,000, with Porter betting a total of $54,094 on the NBA. The total payout from the bets was $76,059, netting Porter $21,965.\n\nHowever, it was revealed in June that Porter had amassed large gambling debts and was leaving games early to help clear those dues, according to the federal government.\n\nAt least four other individuals encouraged Porter to leave games early so he could clear gambling debts and ensure certain under prop bets on his performance would hit. The individuals netted more than $1 million in wagers placed on Porter's performance, according to court documents.\n\nLong Phi Pham, also know as \"Bruce,\" Timothy McCormack of New York City and Mahmud Mollah of Langhorne, PA, were named as defendants in a federal wire fraud case by the U.S. Attorney's Office Eastern District of New York. A fourth unnamed individual has also been included in the case.\n\nThe co-conspirators placed \"under prop\" bets on Porter's performance in two NBA games, knowing in advance he would withdraw from those games for health reasons. Porter reportedly informed Pham he would be leaving two Raptors games on Jan. 26 and March 20 early, while McCormack and Mollah placed the bets on his performance.\n\nPorter was allegedly nervous about the scheme, telling Pham and co-conspirators in a group chat on April 4, 2024, that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" referring to a racketeering charge, and asked if the group chat participants had \"delete[d] all the stuff\" from their personal cell phones.\n\nCourt documents revealed texts from Porter to the conspirators that if he didn't participate in the \"special\" (code for leaving games early) he would face physical harm.\n\n\"If I don't do a special with your terms.

Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports / Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer Missouri men's basketball standout and Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case on Wednesday, per the Associated Press' Jennifer Peltz.\n\nPorter was banned from the NBA on April 17 after being found guilty of a betting scandal surrounding his name. He was first put under investigation on March 25 and wasn't allowed to play until the case was resolved. Porter was then put under criminal investigation by authorities in Canada on June 18.\n\nPorter entered the plea at his arraignment in a New York federal court and was set to be released on a bond of $250,000. Porter is set to be sentenced on Dec. 18 and could face around 3-4 years in prison. He'll also likely have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution and potential fines.\n\n\"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" Porter said in court on Wednesday.\n\nIn the Raptors' Jan. 26 game, there was increased betting interest on the under for Porter props. He ended up playing just four minutes before leaving the game due to a \"re-aggravation of an eye injury\" from a recent game and all of the unders hit. The following morning, DraftKings Sportsbook said that the under on Porter's 3-pointers was the biggest winner of any NBA player prop from that night.\n\nOn the March 20 matchup, Porter played just three minutes before leaving the game due to what the Raptors called an illness. All of the under props hit and DraftKings reported that Porter bets were the most lucrative of the night yet again.\n\nFour men surrounding the scandal were charged with wire fraud a couple of weeks before the Investigation and Enforcement Bureau opened the criminal probe but Porter hadn't been charged just yet.\n\nOne of the four men told Porter, who had gambling debts to pay, that he'd have to purposely exit games early so that the unders would hit.

He was also named the Co-Sixth Man of the Year that season.

Cho.\n\nProsecutors recommended 41 to 51 months in prison at his sentencing December 18. He was released on $250,000 bond insured by his mom and wife and he must continue with gambling counseling.\n\nPorter surrendered to the feds Wednesday morning after a criminal case was opened against him last week, tying him to the alleged betting ring that hinged on Porter's shady performances.\n\nFour gamblers -- Long Phi Pham, Mahmud Mollah, Timothy McCormack and Ammar Awawdeh -- face charges in the case for cashing in on bets from two games Porter purposely bowed out of early, federal prosecutors have said.\n\nPorter, who had racked up huge gambling debts, tipped off the group at the beginning of the year and was encouraged to clear those debts by botching performances in order for his co-conspirators' bets to hit, prosecutors said.\n\nThe quartet allegedly placed \"prop bets\" -- or proposition bets based on a player's performance, like betting the over and under of a certain statistical category -- after finding out ahead of time through a group chat which games Porter would botch.\n\nIn the Raptors' Jan. 26 game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Porter allegedly told one of the defendants that he was going to take himself out early, claiming he was injured.\n\nHe played just four minutes in the game after leaving with a phony eye injury.\n\nPorter then ran a similar stunt during the March 20 game against the Sacramento Kings, only this time he was going to claim that he was allegedly too sick and had to leave the game early.\n\nPorter's stats both performed under expected totals from gambling books in both games.\n\nLater, on April 4, the same day that Porter was banned for life from basketball for betting on games, he texted the group chat and told them that they \"might just get hit w a rico\" -- referring to a racketeering charge -- before asking them to wipe their phones clean.\n\nEach defendant placed \"under\" prop bets on Porter's performance from those games, knowing in advance that he was going to not play the full games, according to court papers.\n\nIn total, the group made more than $1 million on their rigged bets, prosecutors have said, and each defendant faces conspiracy to commit wire fraud charges.\n\nPorter was banned from the NBA after a bombshell investigation found he manipulated the outcome of games to influence the outcome of a bet and also bet on NBA games.\n\nThe league determined that Porter was \"disclosing information to sports bettors\" and \"limiting his own participating in one or more games for betting purposes\" -- finding that Porter placed at least 13 bets on NBA games from January through March of this year.\n\nPorter, a journeyman between the Raptors and their G-League affiliate, averaged 3.7 points and 2.6 rebounds in 37 career games.\n\nHe played college hoops at the University of Missouri, where his dad coached, and went undrafted in 2019 before signing with the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season.\n\nHe is the brother of Denver Nuggets small forward Michael Porter Jr.",

The document doesn't specify a court date or the charge or charges, but it does show the case is related to an existing prosecution of four men charged with scheming to cash in on tips from a player about his plans to exit two games early.\n\nThe Associated Press sent voice and email messages Wednesday to Porter's St. Louis-based lawyer, Jeff Jensen. He said last month that Porter had been \"in over his head due to a gambling addiction\" but was getting treatment and cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nBrooklyn U.S. Attorney Breon Peace's office declined to comment on the new developments.\n\nPeople are also reading... 8-year-old boy dies after Wednesday night crash on I-74 Man found dead behind the wheel of vehicle on Veterans Parkway, police say LaSalle County man dies in illegal fireworks incident Crystal Lake man identified in fatal crash near Downs Pub II marking 50th anniversary with party in uptown Normal Flick Fact: The $800M ex-farm girl from Stanford and Olympia High?

Porter also gambled on NBA games in which he didn't play, once betting against his own team, the league said.\n\nThe four men charged last month appeared in court but haven't yet entered pleas. They're charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and were released on bonds in various amounts.\n\nA court complaint against those four -- Ammar Awawdeh, Timothy McCormack, Mahmud Mollah and Long Phi Pham -- accused them of using prior knowledge of an NBA player's plans so that they or their relatives could place winning bets on his performance.\n\nThe complaint, filed in early June, identified the athlete only as \"Player 1.\" Details about him and the game -- and a quote from an NBA news release -- matched up with the league's probe into Porter.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the player owed \"significant gambling debts\" to Awawdeh, who encouraged the athlete to settle them with a \"special\": intentionally exiting games so that bettors in the know could successfully wager on him falling short of what sportsbooks figured he'd do.\n\n\"If I don't do a special with your terms. Then it's up,\" the player responded in an encrypted message early this year, according to the complaint. \"And u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\"\n\nThe player told some of the four already-charged defendants that he would claim health problems to take himself out of games early on Jan. 26 and March 20, the complaint says.\n\nPorter played only briefly on those dates before leaving the court, complaining of injury or illness. In both games, his points, rebounds and assists were below the betting line for his performance.\n\nLeBron re-signs with Lakers\n\nLeBron James is making it official: He's coming back for a record-tying 22nd season in the NBA, one where the league's all time scoring leader could share the floor with his son Bronny as teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJames has agreed to a two-year contract to remain with the Lakers, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said Wednesday. The second year of the deal is at James' option and means he could become a free agent again next summer, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement had not been announced publicly.\n\nESPN reported that the Lakers and James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, may agree on a salary slightly less than the max that James could have gotten -- a move that could keep the team from reaching the second apron and preserve some roster flexibility going forward.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNew details have emerged regarding former Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter's legal case stemming from his involvement in an illegal gambling scandal.\n\nPorter pleaded guilty on Wednesday at an arraignment in New York on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, according to Jennifer Peltz of The Associated Press. Porter confessed during the court hearing that he had agreed to leave games early in order to get out from under extensive gambling debts.\n\n\"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" Porter told the court.\n\nPorter's sentencing is set for Dec. 18. Under the charge, he faces up to about four years in prison and will likely be forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution and fines.\n\nPorter's plea and confession essentially confirms earlier reporting that Porter was trying to pay off gambling debts by claiming injury and leaving games early.

Though sports betting has become legal in more states in recent years, the NBA does not allow its players to bet on league games. The NBA began investigating Porter after it identified a number of irregular bets involving him, including increased betting interest on props involving him in a January game in which he played for just four minutes before leaving due to injury. After a March 20 game in which Porter also played only a couple of minutes and left early, his props were the biggest money winner for NBA player props on DraftKings.\n\nWhat happens to Porter's alleged co-conspirators.

The NBA banned Porter for life in April, and he'll owe an estimated $456,000 in fines and restitution from the sports betting scandal.\n\nPorter surrendered himself Wednesday morning and admitted to the illegal betting scheme, which netted his co-conspirators $1 million while trying to clear his own gambling debts.\n\n\"I know what I did was wrong and unlawful, and I'm deeply sorry,\" Porter said in front of Brooklyn federal Judge James R. Cho.\n\nPorter's lawyer, Jeff Jensen, told The Associated Press last month that Porter was getting treatment for a gambling addiction.\n\n\"Jontay is a good young man with strong faith that will get him through this,\" Jensen said in a written statement. \"He was in over his head due to a gambling addiction. He is undergoing treatment and has been fully cooperative with law enforcement.\"\n\nFour men have been arrested for their roles in this scandal. On June 4, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced that Long Phi Pham, one of four co-conspirators charged with conspiring to defraud a sports betting company, had been detained. Timothy McCormack and Mahmud Mollah were charged by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn on June 6, and Ammar Awawdeh was charged on June 7.\n\nThe complaint in that case accuses the co-conspirators of persuading an NBA athlete who had \"amassed significant gambling debts\" to leave games early to ensure that their \"under\" prop bets were successful. These men participated \"in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\" United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace said in a written statement.\n\nCanadian authorities have also opened a criminal investigation into the scandal involving Porter, Craig Abrams, a spokesperson for the Ontario Provincial Police, told ESPN on June 18. That investigation is specifically concerned with games that took place in Toronto on Jan. 26 and March 20, both of which Porter allegedly removed himself from early for betting purposes.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_herbert@cbssports.com", "name": "James Herbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breon_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breon Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_for_the_Eastern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Provincial_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Provincial Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/10/0e253f78-a4ab-42d7-a176-18e96520999e/thumbnail/1200x675/51e79679ee1c62b0772443cced4b40ee/jontay-porter-raptors-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720208", "eventUri": "eng-9720208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-26", "dateEnd": "-03-20", "textStart": 2262, "textEnd": 2282}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1212, "textEnd": 1218}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1509, "textEnd": 1515}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1550, "textEnd": 1556}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2167, "textEnd": 2174}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Guilty To NBA Gambling Scheme", "body": "Jontay Porter will never play another game in the NBA after he was banned for life in connection to the gambling scheme that blew up in his face earlier this year, and he could end up spending the next few years in prison after pleading guilty to the federal charges he was hit with as a result.\n\nPrior to the start of the most recent NBA season, Jontay Porter was best known for being the younger brother of Nuggets big man Michael Porter Jr. However, that all changed when the man who spent the bulk of the campaign coming off the bench for the Raptors found himself at the center of a gambling scandal involving inside information linked to prop bets.\n\nIn March, we learned Porter had attracted the scrutiny of sportsbooks who were alerted to suspicious betting patterns concerning games where he prematurely exited the contest while citing illness or injury, and an investigation eventually determined he'd tipped off multiple people who hammered the under on prop bets that subsequently cashed.\n\nIn April, the NBA announced it had collected enough evidence to justify its decision to give Porter the Pete Rose treatment and ban him for life, but his problems didn't end there.\n\nLast week, federal prosecutors revealed they'd decided to charge him with wire fraud over the scheme that reportedly stemmed from a significant gambling debt he'd managed to accrue, and according to The Associated Press, he entered a guilty plea in a courtroom in New York on Wednesday while taking full responsibility, saying, \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\"\n\nAs things currently stand, Porter faces between three-and-a-half and four years in federal prison on top of the fines and restitution he could be ordered to fork over, although he could end up getting a reduced sentence thanks to his decision to cooperate in a case where four people who profited from the inside information he doled out have also been charged.\n\nPorter has been released on a $250,000 bond and is currently slated to learn his fate at a sentencing hearing scheduled for December 18th.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType":

The towering former Toronto Raptors center and power forward conspired with a quartet of gamblers to rig two NBA games so he could claw his way out of his betting debts, federal prosecutors said.\n\nHis alleged co-conspirators, Long Phi Pham, Mahmud Mollah, Timothy McCormack and Ammar Awawdeh, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud last month.\n\n\"I know what I did was wrong and unlawful, and I am deeply sorry for my conduct,\" he said at the Wednesday hearing.\n\nBased on federal sentencing guidelines, Porter could face between 41 and 51 months in prison when he's sentenced Dec. 18, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution and fines. His lawyer has said in the past he's cooperating with prosecutors, but it's unclear how that will factor into his ultimate sentence.\n\nAt Awawdeh's urging, Porter left two games early for medical reasons, one on Jan. 26, the other on March 20, giving the conspiracy members a heads-up so they could make big bets that he'd underperform in those games, the feds allege.\n\n\"If I don't do a special with your terms. Then it's up. And u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up,\" he wrote to Awawdeh in a Telegram message, according to a criminal complaint against the gamblers.\n\nPorter pulled himself from the Raptors' Jan. 26 game against the L.A. Clippers after playing just four minutes and scoring zero points, three rebounds and an assist, telling team officials he had reaggravated an eye injury from a few days earlier. He also left a March 20 game after just three minutes.\n\nMollah in particular bet big on the March 20 game, placing more than $100,000 in a series of wagers that would have paid out more than $1.2 million if the online betting company he used hadn't flagged them as suspicious, the feds allege.\n\nThe NBA opened an investigation into Porter after the March 20 game, and on April 4, the player told the suspects in a group message they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" according to court filings.\n\nOn April 17, the NBA announced Porter was banned from the league for life, because he \"violated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games.\"\n\nHe's the second person to be banned since Adam Silver became NBA commissioner in 2014. The first was former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught on audio making racist comments.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_annese@nydailynews.com", "name": "John Annese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24191637568321.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720208", "eventUri": "eng-9720208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-18", "textStart": 725, "textEnd": 732}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-26", "textStart": 1015, "textEnd": 1022, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-20", "textStart": 1037, "textEnd": 1045, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-04", "textStart": 2037, "textEnd": 2044}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-17", "textStart": 2162, "textEnd": 2170}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

LeBron James chooses Deion Sanders' Colorado in EA CFB 25: Fans react\n\nIn a jaw-dropping confession, former NBA player Jontay Porter revealed that he played a key role in a fraudulent sports betting scheme, tipping off gamblers and intentionally underperforming in games to clear his massive gambling debts. This admission has sent shockwaves through the sports world, highlighting the darker side of professional basketball.\n\nPorter, 24, who once graced the court for the Toronto Raptors, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He now faces an estimated $456,000 in fines and restitution. The disgraced player opened up about his actions, stating, \"I know what I did was wrong and unlawful, and I'm deeply sorry for my conduct,\" during his court appearance before Brooklyn federal Judge James R. Cho.\n\nThe scandal came to light when Porter admitted to placing bets and collaborating with four other individuals to manipulate game outcomes. These co-conspirators, Long Phi Pham, Mahmud Mollah, Timothy McCormack, and Ammar Awawdeh, allegedly profited over $1 million from bets on games Porter intentionally sabotaged.\n\nIn a shocking twist, prosecutors revealed that Porter tipped off the group via a chat, informing them about games he would deliberately underperform. This inside information allowed them to place \"prop bets\" - wagers on specific player performances, such as scoring or playing time - and cash in big.\n\nOne notable instance occurred during the Raptors' January 26 game against the Los Angeles Clippers. Porter, claiming a fake eye injury, exited the game after just four minutes. He repeated a similar stunt on March 20 against the Sacramento Kings, feigning illness to leave the game early. These calculated moves ensured his performance fell below expectations, allowing his co-conspirators' bets to pay off handsomely.\n\nPorter's involvement in the scandal culminated in a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 4, following an investigation that exposed his game-fixing and betting activities. The league found that Porter had placed at least 13 bets on NBA games between January and March of this year and manipulated game outcomes to benefit his betting associates.\n\nFacing significant legal repercussions, Porter has been recommended a prison sentence of 41 to 51 months at his December 18 sentencing. He was released on a $250,000 bond and must continue with gambling counseling.\n\nPorter's revelations have cast a dark cloud over his career, which included stints with the Memphis Grizzlies and a brief tenure in the G-League. The former University of Missouri player, known for averaging a modest 3.7 points and 2.6 rebounds in 37 career games, now faces a future marred by scandal and legal battles.\n\nDespite his fall from grace, Porter remains remorseful, expressing regret for his actions and the pain they caused. However, the fallout from his betrayal has left an indelible mark on the NBA and the integrity of professional sports. As the legal proceedings continue, the sports world watches closely, hoping for justice and a reaffirmation of fair play in the game.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Match fixing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/932c957ac84870430ab2f5d76aafadc2/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/10/17206487813344.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720208", "eventUri": "eng-9720208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-26", "textStart": 1503, "textEnd": 1513}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-20", "textStart": 1661, "textEnd": 1669}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-04", "textStart": 1954, "textEnd": 1961}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-18", "textStart": 2330, "textEnd": 2341}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 458347564, "relevance": 2}

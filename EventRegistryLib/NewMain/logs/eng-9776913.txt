It all started when Greek socialist leader Nikos Androulakis filed a complaint with the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, reporting an attempt to tap his mobile phone using Predator spyware.\n\nIn the months that followed prominent politicians and journalists made similar allegations all pointing the figure at the Greek government, the police, the National Intelligence Service (EYP), and the special anti-terrorist unit (DAEAEV).\n\nThe government had repeatedly said that the spyware is illegal and that it has nothing to do with it. In August 2022, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' nephew, who had political oversight of the National Intelligence Service (EYP), resigned over the spyware scandal, although he denied any role in it. Mitsotakis also fired the head of EYP.\n\nIn January 2023, the Greek government survived a censure motion tabled by the main opposition SYRIZA over the wiretapping scandal.\n\n156 MPs voted against the motion and 143 in favor. A total of 299 MPs participated in the roll-call vote following a three-day discussion.\n\nSupreme Court rules on spyware scandal in Greece\n\nHowever, according to the findings of the Supreme Court's investigation into the scandal, there was no connection between Predator or other similar software and State services.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation lasting almost two years, the Supreme Court Prosecutor Georgia Adilini made the relevant announcement on Tuesday, adding:\n\n\"However, there were 'sufficient indications' at this stage to pursue criminal charges against certain (four) legitimate representatives and actual owners of companies for criminal acts, such as violating the confidentiality of telephone communications, which are classified as misdemeanors. These persons will face trial.\"\n\nThe individuals to be prosecuted are Ioannis Lavranos, Sara Aleksandra Hamu, Tal Jonathan Dilian, and Felix Bitzios.\n\n\"It is highlighted that no other country has conducted such a thorough (judicial) investigation - with the involvement of three Independent Authorities - for a similar case, with most cases resulting in simple penalties and fines against the involved companies,\" Adilini added.\n\nRegarding the regular wiretapping conducted by EYP between 2020 and 2024, the Supreme Court found that all legal protocols were adhered to by then-EYP prosecutor Angeliki Vlachou, who did not require special justification for the wiretapping orders. Consequently, she has been exonerated, and the case has been archived.\n\nJustice spoke and presented the thorough and detailed finding of its investigation, government sources said on Tuesday following the Supreme Court's announcement on the wiretapping issue.\n\n\"From the first moment, we said that we are waiting for the decisions of the Supreme Court, which is the firm position of the government. Justice spoke and presented the thorough and detailed result of its investigation,\" a government spokesperson said.\n\n\"Regarding the part of the case that is still pending before the Court, we repeat our above-mentioned firm position that we trust the independent judicial authorities. We await the opinions of all those who rushed to condemn officials and politicians before the ruling of Justice,\" the spokesperson added, according to the Athens Macedonia News Agency (AMNA).\n\nSYRIZA on the decision on the spyware scandal in Greece\n\n\"Today, with the decision to drop the case of the EYP-Predator scandal, my confidence in the Greek Justice system has been seriously shaken,\" SYRIZA-Progressive Alliance leader Stefanos Kasselakis said on Tuesday in a post on social media, noting that he is speaking as a Greek citizen and not as the leader of the main opposition.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this now coincides with the widespread feeling of the Greek people that Justice is not the last refuge of those who were wronged.\n\n\"That is why one of the first proposals I have put forward to the Greek people is the radical change in the way the leadership of the Judiciary is selected so that it is freed from the suffocating embrace and dependence on the respective government,\" Kasselakis stated adding that an official statement of the main opposition will follow.", "source": {"uri": "greekreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Adeilini's closure of the case infuriated the opposition, with Alexis Charitsis, leader of the New Left party, denouncing it as a \"disgrace for the country.\"\n\nThe \"Predatorgate\" scandal broke in August 2022, when reports surfaced of an attempt to plant Predator on the phone of opposition leader Nikos Androulakis. It was then revealed that his phone had also been tapped lawfully by state surveillance, a move the government described as legal but wrong.\n\nEnsuing investigations by journalists, civil rights organizations and independent telecoms watchdog ADAE revealed that the Greek intelligence service had put a whole range of politicians -- including half the Cabinet -- as well as journalists under surveillance. At the same time, Predator was being planted on some phones by unknown perpetrators.\n\nThe government repeatedly dismissed allegations that PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis had ordered the country's intelligence and security forces to spy on his opponents. Mitsotakis and his allies said \"dirty networks\" within the intelligence services were responsible for the scandal, but all intelligence officials seem to have been exonerated in Tuesday's decision.\n\nThe prime minister's chief of staff and the head of the Greek National Intelligence service both resigned amid Predatorgate. They were subpoenaed by judicial authorities to testify last month, but not as suspects.\n\nSupreme Court prosecutors will only be charging four representatives from the companies that sold Predator in relation to the scandal; the alleged offences are only misdemeanors.\n\nWith a previous parliamentary investigation ending in stalemate and Tuesday's ruling seemingly closing the books on a government inquiry, it appears the ringleaders may never be identified.\n\nGlobal media watchdog Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res (RSF) said it \"regrets\" the prosecutor's decision, while Androulakis, the first victim of the scandal to be revealed in public, said he would continue \"to defend the rule of law with all our strength.\"\n\n\"Light always wins over darkness. No matter how much Mitsotakis thinks that this story is over, we will continue our honest fight,\" Androulakis said in parliament.\n\nMain opposition Syriza leader Stefanos Kasselakis said on X that after Tuesday's news, his \"confidence in the Greek judiciary has been seriously shaken.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is in line with the widespread feeling among the Greek people that justice is no longer the last refuge for the wronged,\" Kasselakis said.", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nektaria_stamouli@politico.eu", "name": "Nektaria Stamouli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spyware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greek language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Civil_and_Criminal_Court_of_Greece", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriakos_Mitsotakis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyriakos Mitsotakis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Left"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Androulakis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikos Androulakis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syriza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reporters Without Borders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/30/GettyImages-2160979328.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776913", "eventUri": "eng-9776913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The leader of the New Left party, Alexis Charitsis, also condemned a \"day of shame.\"\n\nEvidence of guilt emerged for four individuals who in one way or another had a relationship (legal representation or otherwise) with two companies associated with the Predator malware. All four are now criminally prosecuted for breach of telephone privacy, but to the extent of a misdemeanor. The phone-tapping case began in 2022, following claims by Androulakis and journalist Thanasis Koukakis that they had been subjected to state surveillance through Predator spyware. It was later revealed that many high-profile individuals had Predator spyware installed on their devices while also being under official surveillance by EYP.\n\nJustice Wiretapping Politics Subscribe to our Newsletters\n\nEnter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.\n\nSIGN UP NOW Kathimerini may send occasional special offers and promotions.

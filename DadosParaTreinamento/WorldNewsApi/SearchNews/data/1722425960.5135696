Blaise Aliyu, a 15-year-old student, was reportedly punished to death by two of his senior colleagues in an incident that has plunged the institution into mourning. Blaise, who had already faced the cruel blow of losing his parents in 2013, found solace and companionship in his twin brother. Both boys, navigating the harsh realities of life without their parents, were students at the military boarding school in Mando, Kaduna. They had only each other to cling to in a world that had already shown them too much loss and hardship. According to several reports, the tragic incident unfolded when two SS3 students summoned Blaise to their room. What was presented as a mere punishment soon escalated into a fatal encounter. The circumstances of that evening remain shrouded in mystery, but the outcome is heartbreakingly clear: Blaise Aliyu, full of potential and dreams, was no more. His lifeless body, a testament to the brutality he endured, now lies cold in the mortuary, a stark reminder of the cruelty that can exist within human hearts. The Nigerian Air Force, reeling from the shock, has pledged to uncover the truth behind this senseless act. The spokesperson for the institution, Air Vice Marshal Edward Gabkwet, conveyed the profound sorrow felt by the Air Force community. In a statement issued on Saturday, Gabkwet emphasised the gravity with which the incident is being treated. \u201cThe Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Hasan Abubakar, and indeed the entire NAF family are saddened by the painful and unfortunate incident of the untimely death of one of our students at Air Force Secondary School, Kaduna, on June 19, 2024,\u201d Gabkwet said, his words heavy with grief. \u201cTo avoid all sorts of speculations, a thorough investigation is currently ongoing to unravel how, why, and what led to the death of the victim. Rest assured that this matter is receiving the utmost urgency it deserves, and we won\u2019t rest until it is unravelled,\u201d he added. The investigation seeks to bring clarity to the horrific circumstances that led to Blaise\u2019s death. The pain is unfathomable for his twin brother, left alone in the halls that once echoed with their shared laughter and dreams. The school, a place meant to nurture and protect, has instead become a site of his most profound sorrow. As the investigation unfolds, the haunting image of Blaise\u2019s untimely death will remain etched in the hearts of all who hear his story. It is a stark reminder of the need for vigilance, compassion, and a re-evaluation of the systems meant to protect pupils in Nigerian military colleges. Several activists have said the memory of Blaise Aliyu, an innocent soul taken too soon, is one tragedy that should never befall another child again. Amnesty Intl seeks justice Amnesty International Nigeria has strongly condemned the recent killing of 15-year-old Blaise. Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, Isa Sanusi, stated, \u201cAmnesty International is deeply concerned by the increase in such awful cases of students losing their lives in school. For our children, education should not be a matter of life and death.\u201d Sanusi stressed the need for a thorough investigation into Felix\u2019s death, declaring, \u201cThis incident must not be swept under the carpet and justice must be served.\u201d The human rights organisation, therefore, called for urgent measures to address bullying and ensure the safety of students in schools. \u201cGiven the increasing incidents like this, the authorities must develop and implement zero tolerance for bullying in schools,\u201d Sanusi urged. A promising life cut short Blaise\u2019s death is not the first time a young pupil will lose their lives in a military school due to harsh punishment. In June 2022, a student of Command Secondary School, Enugu, Eneh Chinemerem, was reportedly flogged to death by a soldier-teacher whose identity was not revealed. The student who was in SS1 was caned repeatedly on the head for allegedly having bushy hair and not having a haircut before School Day. The mother, Adaeze Chibuzor, broke the news in a Facebook post on the Nkanu People of Enugu State Nigeria platform with pictures of the deceased showing a swollen eye and head before his demise. Sources told The PUNCH that the boy\u2019s head started swelling, causing the parents to move him from one hospital to another until his untimely death. The mother of the deceased, on her Facebook page, wrote, \u201cIt is still very hard to believe that you are gone, my son. But one thing I know is that God will surely fight for us. Rest in peace, my son. \u201cAn Army man flogged my son in school to death in Command Secondary School, Enugu. RIP to my first fruit in life!\u201d Meanwhile, Facebook users, who were enraged by the death of the young lad, described the incident as cruel and called for justice. A Facebook user, Mrs Eneh Nididiamaka, wrote, \u201cIt is indeed a sad story! What on earth did this boy commit to warrant such beating from a heartless soldier? RIP son!\u201d Narrating how she lost his brother in a similar circumstance, Nnaji Miriam Izuogu, another Facebook user, wrote, \u201cThis is exactly what happened to my kid brother last year November 2021, in the same school. Now, this story. Today, Pascal, my brother, is no more. RIP to his soul! \u201cIt\u2019s so painful. By now, Paschal is supposed to be writing his West African Senior School Certificate Examination. Let the anger of God descend on the army killer of Paschal and this son of Ndidiamaka.\u201d When our correspondent reached out to Izuogu to share her story, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to revisit the past. My brother was killed there and no justice was done. Our family has moved on.\u201d Another user, Oge Ezeji wrote, \u201cMadam, it is very painful you have to lose your son. Yesterday, I was very bitter when my son came back and was narrating the story to me. This is a boy who is supposed to start his inter-command exam today. \u201cSoldier, it will not be well with you.\u201d NANS grieves Also reacting to the young boy\u2019s death, the National Association of Nigerian Students, Enugu State chapter, issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Nigerian Army to fish out its personnel that reportedly killed Chinemerem. The students\u2019 body warned that after the expiration of the ultimatum, if the culprit wasn\u2019t brought to face justice as the law demanded, they would shut down the school and the 82 Division of the Nigerian Army. The student body described the degrading treatment and military brutalisation that led to the death of the lad as uncalled for and unacceptable in modern society while demanding a thorough investigation. NANS in the statement signed by its Chairman, Ikechukwu Obi, and Secretary, Chinonso Emmanuel, regretted that the dreams and aspirations of the young boy had been dashed by the unprofessional conduct of a Nigerian soldier. Although pressures were high, not much is heard of the matter to date. Several reports alleged that the lad\u2019s family handed the matter to God and decided not to press charges or seek compensation. Efforts to get the mother of the deceased to share any update on the matter proved abortive. She did not respond to her Facebook messages, and a mobile number said to be hers rang out when our correspondent called on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning. Another youngster bites the dust In the confines of a popular military school in Lagos, a dark chapter unfolded in March 2021. The institution became the scene of a heartbreaking tragedy that claimed the life of one Ibrahim (surname withheld), a 15-year-old student. Abdullahi, a vibrant and promising young boy, was just like any other student at the school. His parents, proud of his enrollment in the prestigious institution, had high hopes for his future. Little did they know that their son\u2019s life would be tragically cut short due to extreme disciplinary measures. On a seemingly ordinary day in March, Ibrahim\u2019s world turned upside down. Senior cadets, reportedly angered by minor infractions allegedly committed by Ibrahim, decided to teach him a lesson. The specifics of his so-called offences were never officially detailed, but they were typical of the minor infractions that often lead to corrective measures in military schools. Under the unforgiving sun, Ibrahim was subjected to severe physical punishment. Senior cadets ordered him to perform repetitive push-ups and sit-ups. Eyewitnesses described the exercises as excessively harsh, with Ibrahim forced to continue without adequate rest or hydration. His pleas for a reprieve fell on deaf ears as the senior cadets overseeing the punishment ignored his visible signs of physical distress. As the punishment dragged on, Ibrahim\u2019s body began to give out. He showed clear signs of exhaustion and distress, yet the cadets dismissed his collapse as an attempt to evade further punishment. It was only after a significant delay that the severity of his condition was recognized. Alarmed by his unresponsiveness, fellow students and junior cadets alerted the school authorities. The school\u2019s medical personnel were said to have been summoned urgently, and Ibrahim was rushed to the school\u2019s medical facility. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to revive him. In a desperate bid to save his life, Ibrahim was transferred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, where doctors confirmed the worst \u2013 the young boy had passed away. The cause of death was attributed to complications arising from extreme physical exertion and potential dehydration. The administration of the military school expressed profound regret over the incident. The Commandant (name withheld) released an official statement promising a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Ibrahim\u2019s death. The investigation aimed to identify the senior cadets involved and understand how such extreme punishment could have been administered unchecked. An inquiry team was formed, including school officials, military personnel, and representatives from the Lagos State Ministry of Education. They interviewed witnesses, reviewed surveillance footage, and examined the protocols in place for student discipline. The then-Lagos State Police Command, led by CP Hakeem Odumosu, also launched a criminal investigation into the matter. Grieving parents Ibrahim\u2019s grieving parents, represented by their lawyer, Aminu Olaniyan, demanded justice and accountability. The public outcry was swift and intense, with parents, human rights groups, and concerned citizens calling for reforms in the disciplinary practices of military schools. The death of Ibrahim Abdullahi became a rallying point for those advocating for the humane treatment of students. For instance, in the wake of the tragedy, there were urgent discussions among higher-level military and educational authorities about reviewing and overhauling the disciplinary measures and supervision mechanisms in military secondary schools. The Ministry of Defence, led by then-Minister Bashir Magashi, and the then-Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, emphasised the need for a balance between discipline and student welfare. Abdullahi\u2019s death serves as a stark reminder of the potentially fatal consequences of unchecked disciplinary practices in military schools. It prompted a critical examination of the balance between discipline and the humane treatment of students, highlighting the urgent need for systemic changes to prevent such tragedies in the future. Military secondary schools According to several online sources and websites of several military or command schools in Nigeria, training in Nigerian military secondary schools is designed to instil discipline, physical fitness, academic excellence, and military knowledge in students. These schools follow a rigorous and structured regimen. Academic training For the curriculum, students follow the national curriculum set by the Nigerian Ministry of Education, which includes subjects like Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, and more. For examinations, they prepare for national exams like the Junior Secondary Certificate Examination and the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, like other secondary schools. However, there is a strict timetable for classes, study periods, and assignments to ensure academic excellence. Physical training In addition to academics, daily physical training sessions are mandatory. These include morning runs, drills, push-ups, sit-ups, and other callisthenics. These are where the issues occur, as there have been several cases of exhaustion and even death during these tough drills. On social media, several ex-students have lamented how tough the training was for them and how some pupils could not cope because of how rigorous and physically demanding it was. In addition to the drills, there are sports and regular outdoor exercises, which, they said were \u2018to build endurance, strength, and agility\u2019. Military training Cadets undergo regular drills and learn parade movements, which are essential for military discipline and coordination. Introduction to handling and maintaining firearms, though actual firing practice may be limited depending on the age of the students. Basic military tactics, strategies, and formations are taught as well in these schools. Challenges, concerns Despite the structured training, Nigerian military secondary schools have faced criticism regarding harsh punishment, mental stress, bullying and hazing. A popular management consultant, Dr Dipo Awojide, lamented in a post on X how he went through \u2018beating, intimidation and madness\u2019 while in a military secondary school. He wrote, via @OgbeniDipo, \u201cThe amount of beating, intimidation and madness I witnessed in Secondary School by military men, oh shit, it killed every form of human sympathy in me. It\u2019s like they train them to be heartless and very wicked.\u201d The comments under his post are uncanny. Several ex-pupils spoke of very eerie experiences of torture at the hands of officers and seniors while in the school. Some stated how they had to drop out or never returned after holidays because of how they were treated. An ex-student, who did not want to be mentioned in print for fear of victimisation, told our correspondent that he was hung on a ceiling on one occasion and flogged mercilessly by officers because he hissed during a class. \u201cThis was in 2008. I only stayed for three years in that school. When I got home after my third year in that school, my mother vowed never to take me back there. My entire back was designed with cane marks. Some were from seniors; others were from senior officers who made us go through unthinkable drills,\u201d he said. A female ex-student who said she went to a military school in Kaduna said, \u201cThere is nothing like \u2018girl\u2019 there. All of us were treated like men. I couldn\u2019t go past one year. I ran for my dear life. The zeal to become an officer died immediately.\u201d Despite the instances of extreme physical punishment leading to injuries or fatalities and intense regimen, some ex-students said it was the best experience they ever had. \u201cThe school instilled discipline in me. I have two children now and two of them are currently in command schools in Port Harcourt, Rivers State,\u201d Mr Tonye Opubo-Pepple, a parent told our correspondent. Another ex-student, Trisha Oruchukwu, who is now based in Ontario, Canada, said she enjoyed the tough training because, according to her, it made her a better person. \u201cI knew not everyone would be able to withstand the physical exercises because sometimes, it can be a bit too much, but I enjoyed it. I loved the running, jumping and everything in between. \u201cI thought I would go on to the Nigeria Defence Academy, but my parents said no. I remember that I cried for more than two months because I wanted to really go back because of how much I enjoyed the training,\u201d she said in an emailed response to our correspondent on Friday morning. UNICEF condemns violent discipline In 2021, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund said over 85 per cent of Nigerian children between the ages of one and 14 experience violent discipline in schools, with nearly one in three children experiencing severe physical punishment. UNICEF chief of education, Saadhna Panday-Soobrayan, disclosed this in Abuja at a two-day national awareness creation meeting on Ending Corporal Punishment in schools, organised by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria in collaboration with UNICEF. Panday-Soobrayan described the discussion on ending corporal punishment in schools as \u201cdifficult and heart-breaking,\u201d stating, however, that the presence of participants at the meeting was a testament to Nigeria\u2019s determination to uphold every child\u2019s right to safety, well-being and quality, inclusive education. \u201cMuch of this violent discipline takes place in the form of corporal punishment in the very institutions that are entrusted to keep children safe, develop respect for human rights and prepare them for life in a society that promotes understanding peace, and conflict resolution through dialogue,\u201d she said. She said the persistence of these practices contradicts Nigeria\u2019s national policy on safety, security and violence-free schools that commits to zero-tolerance to any threat to the security of lives and property in schools. Panday-Soobrayan further noted that the practice impedes Nigeria\u2019s progress towards SDG 3 to ensure good health and well-being, SDG 4 on equitable and inclusive quality education and target 16.2 (to end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children).\u201d Training staff, a priority \u2013 Army The Nigerian Army, on March 1, 2024, announced its commitment to prioritise the training of command school staff to enhance the quality of education provided to the children of personnel in all Army Schools. The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 3 Division/Commander Operation SAFE HAVEN, Major General AE Abubakar, made this known while declaring open the 3 Division Education First Quarter Conference 2024 held at the Command Secondary School Auditorium Jos, the Plateau state capital. Declaring the event open, Abubakar emphasized that the conference was organised in line with the Chief of Army Staff\u2019s mission to improve the welfare needs of personnel and their dependents. He highlighted the Nigerian Army Education Corps\u2019 commitment to building sustainable platforms for educational development in support of the Command philosophy of the COAS. The GOC further emphasised that the conference provides a valuable platform for educators to exchange ideas, learn from experts, and stay updated on the latest developments in their fields. He stressed that education is not only essential for professional growth but also serves as a catalyst for personal advancement, shaping officers and soldiers into well-rounded leaders capable of addressing the diverse challenges of the battlefield. \u2018Pupils must be protected against abuse\u2019 Meanwhile, an educationist, Mr Uwem Andikan, said irrespective of the school a child is enrolled, the dignity of the child must be protected. He said corporal punishments in most states have been abolished and military schools should not be an exemption to this rule. \u201cThey operate the government curriculum. They also take the government exam. The pupils there are not officers or cadets. They are pupils, with flesh and blood, like their counterparts in other regular schools. They should be protected and not abused in the name of discipline or training,\u201d he said. Cadets\u2019 death In September 2016, a cadet at the Nigeria Defence Academy, Kaduna, James Didam Bulus, 18, with registration number NDA/11537, died of alleged brutality from senior cadets, 24 hours after he reported to the institution. This is just as the Public Relations Officer of the Academy, Captain Musa Yahaya, explained that the cadet sustained internal injuries from an accident he had before he arrived at the academy that Saturday for training. Several reports noted that a contingent of the Nigerian Army buried the late cadet with full military honour a few days later at the Military Cemetery, on Wharf Road, Kaduna. Also, Brigadier General M.G. Kangye and the Cadets Commandant of the school were said to have handed over the Nigeria National Flag, a pair of army boots and an army ceremonial cap to the mourning father of the deceased, Mr Didam Joshua. Relations of the dead cadet were too distraught to speak at the time, but a close family friend, who pleaded for anonymity told the media that James was beaten to death on his \u201cintroductory\u201d night. He said, \u201cHe arrived at NDA on Saturday, September 3, 2016, and on Monday, September 5, I was told that he was dead. \u201cI learnt he had died on Sunday after he did not survive what I was told was \u2018introduction\u2019 beatings from his seniors. At the mortuary, you could see stitches on his head and he had bruises on other parts of the body. But NDA spokesman, reacting, noted, \u201cWhen he died, we conducted an autopsy at 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital where it was discovered that a few days to his death, he sustained internal injuries which caused his death.\u201d He noted that the present commandant has withdrawn what is called \u2018welcome beating\u2019 which used to be initiated on fresh cadets in the academy. NDA killed my son \u2013 Retd soldier In July of the previous year, a retired Wing Commander from Kaduna State, Danladi Kwasu, accused the authorities of the Nigerian Defence Academy of murdering his son, who was until his death an officer cadet in the Academy. The retired Air Force Officer, accused the NDA officials of pushing his 19-year-old son, El-Shadai Kwasu, with academy number NDA/10037, deliberately into a 100 metre-deep lake and drowning him during a training exercise on April 30, 2015. A letter from the management of the NDA showed that the deceased died from cardiopulmonary arrest after he drowned inside a river while undergoing a routine watermanship training exercise at Kangimi Dam in Kaduna State. Mr Kwasu, devastated by the sudden death of his son, demanded an explanation from the NDA on what could have led to his son\u2019s death among the 500 officer cadets who took part in the swimming exercise. According to him, his son died out of negligence by the Academy\u2019s instructors who took him to the river. He also alleged that about 20 officer cadets had been killed in similar circumstances over the years with the NDA authorities doing nothing to change the situation, although the NDA authorities declined to make an official comment on the allegation. A letter written by the NDA Commandant, Major General Mohammed Idris, conveying the news of the late El-Shadai\u2019s death to his parents surfaced on social media. In the letter dated April 30, 2015, and titled, \u2018Notice of Casualty: NDA/10037 Cadet El-Shadai Kwasu\u2019, the Commandant stated that the late officer cadet died as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to drowning while undergoing watermanship training during one of their routine exercises called Exercise Camp Highland at Kangimi Dam in Kaduna State. The Commandant\u2019s letter also informed the deceased parents to authorize a postmortem on the corpse before burial and also requested that the academy bear the burial cost. This was said to have been rejected by the father who took his son\u2019s death as an act of God. However, with Kwasu\u2019s insistence on knowing what killed his son, sources at the NDA have accused him of blackmail. The Defence Academy further wondered why Kwasu, a retired military officer, who knows all military doctrines and had during his son\u2019s admission into the Academy, signed the parents/guardian consent form, which includes not to claim any compensation or relief for any injury or death in the course of his son\u2019s training, suddenly made a U-turn to challenge his son\u2019s death. Controversial clause In November 2017, a mother whose son had applied for the Nigerian Navy\u2019s Direct Short Service Commission raised the alarm over a \u2018controversial clause\u2019 in the declaration form required for his child\u2019s participation in the recruitment exercise. The clause in question, found under the \u201cCertification by Parents/Guardian\u201d section, stated, \u201cI\u2026..parent/guardian of\u2026., who is applying for recruitment into the Nigerian Navy, hereby certify that I fully understand that my child/ward will (if required to) attend the Recruitment Exercise and I shall not demand compensation or relief from the Government in respect of death or any injury which my child/ward may sustain in the course of or as a result of any task given to him/her during the exercise.\u201d Expressing her dismay, the parent, who opted to remain anonymous to protect her child\u2019s application, found the clause offensive and indicative of the government\u2019s disregard for citizens\u2019 lives. \u201cI can never sign such a thing for my child. Just reading it made me tell my son to abandon the idea,\u201d he said, visibly frustrated. \u201cMy son wants to serve his country, and now they expect him to participate in a recruitment exercise, yet refuse to take responsibility if something goes wrong? What\u2019s the point? Why invite people if you won\u2019t ensure their safety?\u201d she told BusinessDay. The parent\u2019s concerns highlight broader issues regarding the accountability and safety measures within Nigeria\u2019s military recruitment processes. As debate continues over the clause, many are questioning the implications for aspiring recruits and their families. Four cadets die in Kaduna In 2016, controversies trailed a recruitment exercise being carried out by the Nigerian Defence Academy, after four cadets who were recently enlisted into the institution died during the intensive military training exercises. The cadets were said to have died after medical complications arising from the intensive rigorous exercises which exposed their unfitness a few weeks after their admission. The death of the four cadets which was said to have jolted the leadership of the institution, resulted in the authorities, instituting a panel to investigate the medical and physical condition of other cadets undergoing military training in the institution. At the end of the panel\u2019s sitting, the investigators who included physical training experts, physiotherapists, psychologists and medical doctors, discovered that a sizeable number of the cadets were suffering from severe medical deficiency. Further investigation by The PUNCH revealed that the situation was so bad that over 50 cadets were discovered to be suffering from life-threatening diseases. Military training not for unfit people \u2013 Ex-US Army captain Speaking to our correspondent, a former Captain in the United States of America Army, Bishop Johnson, said before anyone was accepted during the recruitment process, they would have to undergo both physical and medical assessment to determine whether they were physically fit to undergo the rigorous training in the military. He said, \u201cThe medical officers would also check to see if there\u2019s any medical condition that will prohibit your ability to go through any training and also remain in the service. \u201cThese are all part of the assessment processes. Nigeria recruits have to go through both assessments. They have to go through a physical assessment as well as an academic test and medical test. It\u2019s a standard practice across the globe.\u201d Speaking of cases of extreme training, he said military training was not a joke. The retired captain added, \u201cThe trainers would drill you so you would be able to withstand the worst-case scenario. \u201cAs a military officer, when you\u2019re a combat, there\u2019s a possibility that you can be captured. So, they\u2019ll pass you through rigorous training that will be equivalent to the kind of punishment that you\u2019re going to receive if you are held hostage by the enemy. \u201cIt\u2019s designed like that. Not everybody who is recruited will eventually qualified and become military personnel, because it\u2019s a very tough job. A lot of civilians don\u2019t understand what services members go through.\u201d Speaking of torture in military secondary schools, Johnson said torture from teachers or fellow students was not a regular occurrence. He said, \u201cI think it (torture) is unusual. It\u2019s something that the authorities will have to investigate and put a stop to. \u201cIt is true that pupils, just like every other human being, die but it should not be as a result of torture from staff of fellow students.\u201d He added that there was a need for the top hierarchy of the military to look into the matter and put in policy to prevent that from happening. It\u2019s not part of the training. He said, \u201cThe curriculum for training is designed in such that all the safety measures are put into place. Even though there is tough training, they put measures in place to make sure nobody is hurt or dies in the course of it, unless that person has an undetected illness.\u201d Army responds The Director of Media Operations for the Nigeria Army, Major General Edward Buba, responding to our correspondent\u2019s enquiry on the matter, said the country\u2019s military training was the best anywhere in the world. Although he was silent on the issue of torture and excessive use of force, he said, \u201cThe military train for war at peacetime, which is the best time to train. Our training confirms with best practices obtained everywhere in the world, part of the reasons foreigners subscribe to train in Nigeria.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Young pupils in military secondary schools across the country and cadets, who undergo training in military camps to become officers, have met their untimely deaths while pursuing their dreams due to tough military drills and intense disciplinary actions by seniors, GODFREY GEORGE writes The corridors of the Air Force Comprehensive School, Kaduna, were shattered by </p>\n <br/> <a href='https://punchng.com/how-intense-military-training-harsh-punishments-from-seniors-send-young-pupils-cadets-to-early-graves/'>Read More</a>", "url": "https://punchng.com/how-intense-military-training-harsh-punishments-from-seniors-send-young-pupils-cadets-to-early-graves/", "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/28214249/military-training.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:44:24", "author": "Godfrey George", "authors": ["Godfrey George"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.138}

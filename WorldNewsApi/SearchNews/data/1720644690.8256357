A dour 1-0 defeat to Iceland means the Three Lions head to Germany on the back of one of their worst performances in recent memory. And Gareth Southgate doesn\u2019t have long to pick up the mood ahead of next Sunday\u2019s opener vs Serbia in Gelsenkirchen. Southgate insisted there were plenty of reasons behind England\u2019s limp display against their old foes, with more than one eye on the start of the tournament proper. But after being booed off by their own fans, there are plenty of questions to answer and not a lot of time to find the answers. Mirror Football looks at five selection dilemmas Southgate will need to solve before their latest attempt to end 58 years of hurt starts next weekend\u2026 Who starts in central defence? The defeat to Iceland - in the grand scheme of things - shouldn't matter too much, but it\u2019s a different story for any potential injury to John Stones. Southgate tried to play down the issue, yet concerns over the Manchester City star\u2019s ability to play throughout a gruelling campaign remain. Assuming he is fit, there is still a decision to be made on who plays next to Stones. Marc Guehi appears to be the leader in the clubhouse, but both Ezri Konsa and Lewis Dunk could come into his thinking over the next week. Regardless of the decision he ultimately makes, the absence of Harry Maguire in the heart of England\u2019s defence is already being sorely felt. Who should start at centre-back for England against Serbia? Tell us your XI in the comments section Where to play Alexander-Arnold? After being handed the number 8 shirt, it appears the plan for Trent Alexander-Arnold is to operate as a midfielder. If that is the case, he would almost certainly operate next to Declan Rice at the base of England\u2019s engine room. But the fact remains that his world-class ability to put balls in the box has greater impact from his usual right-back berth. Jurgen Klopp managed to deploy Alexander-Arnold in a hybrid role which allowed him to influence the game centrally, while still offering width on the right flank. A quick chat with the former Liverpool boss may be a wise way for Southgate to spend some of his time in the build-up to next weekend\u2019s opener. Is Trippier the answer? When Kieran Trippier was named as England\u2019s starting left-back at the beginning of their last European Championship campaign, eyebrows were raised. Three years on, and after a mixed campaign, his place is under even more scrutiny. What Southgate would do for a fully fit Luke Shaw, but the Manchester United defender is almost certain to miss Serbia, with a return later in the group the target. However, with Shaw out, the options behind Trippier are at a scarcity. Southgate could spring a surprise and swap Walker\u2019s flank, allowing Alexander-Arnold to play on the other side, but that could prove too bold for such a huge game. How do England get firing again? A solitary shot on target was all England had to show for their dominance of possession against Iceland. The visitors set up with a low block, a tactic likely to be deployed by all of England\u2019s group opponents. Unfortunately for Southgate\u2019s side they were unable to penetrate that low block, with wave after wave of laborious possession ending without a decisive action. Jude Bellingham will be a welcome addition against Serbia, with Phil Foden moved to the left and Bukayo Saka returning to the XI on the right. But whoever starts on the wings next weekend should feel their place isn\u2019t secure, with Eberechi Eze and Cole Palmer both under strong consideration. Harry Kane also looked uncharacteristically rusty against Iceland. If England are to have a run in Germany, the Bundesliga\u2019s top scorer will simply have to be better.

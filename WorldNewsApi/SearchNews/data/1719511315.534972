The beloved Snoo Smart Sleeper Bassinet is 25% off at both Happiest Baby and Amazon, saving you over $400 on this sought-after baby item. Save 25% on a hugely popular bassinet during the Snoo sale this Memorial Day weekend. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: HAPPIEST BABY When you\u2019re a new parent, sleep is precious. I know that I would have paid anything to get a little extra rest, especially during those first few colicky months with an infant. After testing 10 top models, our writer (a mother of five) found that the Snoo bassinet soothed her newborn the best, allowing everyone in her household to enjoy more sleep. The Snoo deploys white noise and movement to help soothe your baby to sleep, and it keeps newborns safely on their backs with a built-in swaddle system\u2014but it is admittedly pricey. This Memorial Day Snoo sale brings the price of the feature-laden Snoo down to $1,271 at certain retailers. (Notably, it remains full-price at other retailers, including Target and Pottery Barn Kids.) This isn\u2019t as steep as the Black Friday discount, but it still offers significant savings on a bassinet designed to calm fussing and help parents clock more shut-eye. Shop The Memorial Day Snoo Sale MOST POPULAR Happiest Baby Snoo Smart Sleeper Bassinet The Snoo smart bassinet, from pediatrician Dr. Harvey Karp and his Happiest Baby company, may be a pricey choice when compared to more standard bassinets, but it truly is nothing short of a miracle worker for many newborns and their parents. It rocks your baby at just the right speed (you can customize it), swaddles them securely into a snug custom swaddle on their backs and provides varying levels of white noise to lull them to sleep. And it responds with these soothing mechanisms as your baby starts to fuss, thus doling out sleep training on-the-go. There\u2019s also a weaning feature when you\u2019re ready to transition your baby to the crib. (Read our tester\u2019s in-depth review of the Snoo for more information.) While the Snoo bassinet doesn\u2019t work for every baby, many parents say it gains them significantly more shut-eye in any given night. Molly Taylor, an Alexandria, Virginia-based new mom, told me that she switched her little one to the Snoo around 4-weeks of age and was happy she did. \u201cMy husband and I were taking turns doing 3-hour shifts overnight in the nursery, which was exhausting and unsustainable,\u201d Taylor explains. Now her little one \u201cfalls asleep almost instantly as soon as we get him all swaddled and secure in the Snoo,\u201d and he\u2019s waking just once a night to eat. Purchasing the bassinet for 25% off during this Memorial Day Snoo sale is a particularly smart investment if you\u2019re getting ready to have your first baby and plan to have additional children. After all, it can only be used until your baby is 6 months old or they start pushing up onto their hands and knees\u2014but then you\u2019ll have it on-hand for baby number two and beyond.

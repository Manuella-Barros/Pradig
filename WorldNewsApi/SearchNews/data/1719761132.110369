{"id": 225091242, "title": "France\u2019s Faux Pacific Power: The Colonial Reality in New Caledonia", "text": "The recent unrest in New Caledonia highlights France\u2019s enduring colonial legacy in Asia and shatters its self-ascribed image as a legitimate Pacific power. The Indigenous Kanak people have clearly demonstrated their interest in self-determination and their willingness to fight for independence. Rather than preserving its control of the island by force, Paris should immediately allow a new referendum to replace the illegitimate 2021 vote, which the Kanak boycotted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. France seems more focused on undermining the majority Kanak population\u2019s influence by empowering French settlers. The Macron administration aims to expand French control over the island by amending the constitution to allow more settlers to vote on local matters, thus diluting Kanak influence. The Kanak people see this legislation as a threat to their long-term political interests and have understandably chosen to resist. The protests, although violent, are a reaction to the French settlers\u2019 armed militias and military tactics. Conflict between the Kanak people and French settlers is nothing new; violence between the two groups has been a feature of France\u2019s colonial rule since its inception. Calls for independence can be traced back to at least the 1970s. Throughout this colonial history, French settlers have employed policies that structurally marginalize the Kanak, dominating the island\u2019s politics and businesses while relegating the Kanak people to second-class status. This is the context in which France claims New Caledonia has \u201cchosen\u201d to remain a territory. The current unrest is particularly significant given France\u2019s foreign policy stance on protecting the territorial and sovereign integrity of Ukraine and self-determination of Hong Kong and Taiwan. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to counter indigenous calls for self-governance in New Caledonia, shortly after criticizing China for its \u201cnew imperialism\u201d in the Pacific, is strikingly hypocritical. In terms of France\u2019s broader Indo-Pacific engagement, the strategic implications are profound both for Paris and its Western-aligned allies. By using force to counter what Macron called an \u201cunprecedented insurrection movement,\u201d France is demonstrating its commitment to continued colonial rule, putting it at direct odds with Asian states where anti-colonial sentiment infuses nationalism. By dismissing indigenous calls for political autonomy and independence, France undermines Asian norms of self-actualization, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. This rejection of self-determination has implications for France\u2019s professed support for Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Macron administration\u2019s marginalization of New Caledonia\u2019s Kanak people is in direct opposition to regional trends. In Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Taiwan, politicians and populations are committed to indigenous recognition and reconciliation. It is curious that Canberra and Wellington are not more vocal in their condemnation of France\u2019s approach. Regional states and institutions, already deeply cynical about Western ideals, given foreign policy exceptionalism on matters like the Ukraine war and Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza, are not oblivious to these contradictions. In the Pacific, representatives from the Pacific Island Forum and Vanuatu have identified \u201cthe unfinished business of decolonization\u201d as the driver behind New Caledonia\u2019s political unrest. The influential Pacific Conference of Churches identified France\u2019s \u201cdehumanization\u201d of the Kanak people as the root cause of the current violence. In Asia, Indonesian media have widely reported on the New Caledonian independence movement, casting France as a colonizer willing to use military force to preserve its political dominance. Vietnamese commentary similarly identifies unresolved French colonialism as the root cause of New Caledonia\u2019s political unrest. Chinese media are also critical of French double standards toward New Caledonia, particularly on matters of censorship, self-determination, democracy, territorial integrity, and rule of law. All this points to the fundamental fact that France is not a sustainable Pacific power. Its claim to regional status is based on its refusal to recognize its colonial legacy in Asia and the Pacific and to amend this through post-colonial reconciliation, including the recognition of national independence. The idea that any European state has the right to maintain overseas \u201cterritories\u201d in 2024 is a grotesque miscarriage of justice that needs immediate remedy. Otherwise, the notion that any Western state is committed to a \u201crules-based order\u201d is nothing more than lip service to ongoing exploitation.", "summary": "In terms of France\u2019s broader Indo-Pacific engagement, the strategic implications of the New Caledonia uprising are profound both for Paris and its Western-aligned allies.", "url": "https://thediplomat.com/2024/05/frances-faux-pacific-power-the-colonial-reality-in-new-caledonia/", "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2024-05-23-173222.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:15:00", "author": "Jeffrey Reeves", "authors": ["Jeffrey Reeves"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.067}

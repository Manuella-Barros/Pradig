Whereas the bodies of a senior couple, identified as Prakash Doshi, 73, and Harshita Doshi, 69, residents of Matunga in Mumbai, were fished out, said the SP.\n\nGoa's beaches are closed for swimming during the monsoon, and the lifeguarding agency has urged the public to avoid swimming due to rough sea conditions, including dangerous rip currents and high tides, in addition to strong winds, which makes venturing into the sea risk prone.\n\nThe west coast stretching from Phalghar in Maharashtra through Udupi in Karnataka is currently under a severe high tide alert with a warning that waves could range from 4-4.3 meters high.\n\nThe monsoon, which typically lasts from June to September, triggers increased rainfall, rough seas and unpredictable weather patterns, making water-oriented activities along the coastline particularly risky.\n\nAn advisory has also been issued urging visitors to avoid rocky areas, cliffs and hills along the shoreline. During the monsoon season, these locations become especially dangerous due to their slippery surfaces. The sea also experiences increased wave height, intensity and frequency, significantly raising the risk of beachgoers being swept into the turbulent waters, according to lifeguarding agency Drishti.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candolim", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Candolim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Candolim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_of_police_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent of police (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panaji", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panaji"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Panaji"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Medical_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goa Medical College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matunga", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matunga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matunga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cliff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lifeguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udupi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Udupi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Udupi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach Soccer", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/19/1600x900/-Representative-Photo-_1721396877476.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747895", "eventUri": "eng-9747895", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Panaji"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

There was some good performances. It was a good team win.\"\n\nTommy Pham drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the top of the 10th and the White Sox were an out away in the bottom half when crew chief Dan Iassogna stopped play and called out the grounds crew after John Brebbia threw his first pitch to Nolan Gorman.\n\n\"I love the elements,\" Brebbia said. \"You don't often get to play when it's pouring rain because they stop the game, so I try and take every advantage of that as possible.

LOUIS -- What began as a light sprinkle turned into a downpour as Chicago White Sox reliever John Brebbia faced Masyn Winn.\n\nThe Sox led by a run in the bottom of the 10th, but the St. Louis Cardinals had the bases loaded and one out. As fans scrambled for cover at Busch Stadium, Brebbia tried to keep his hand and the ball as dry as possible to execute his pitches.\n\nBrebbia struck out Winn, then got within two strikes of wrapping up the game when the next batter, Nolan Gorman, fouled off the first pitch. Brebbia approached plate umpire CB Bucknor for a ball as crew chief Dan Iassogna pulled everyone off the field, signaling the start of a rain delay.\n\nThe game resumed after a 3-hour, 3-minute delay with Tanner Banks in relief for the Sox against pinch hitter Iv\u00e1n Herrera. Banks got the strikeout looking to complete a 6-5 Sox victory in front of a small portion of the announced crowd of 38,559.\n\nThe Sox snapped a four-game losing streak and improved to 2-14 on the road. They are 7-26 overall.\n\nThe day began with an intriguing pitching matchup of Erick Fedde versus former Sox hurler Lance Lynn. Fedde had allowed just three earned runs over 20 innings during his three previous starts, while Lynn had a 2.64 ERA in his first six starts.\n\nFedde struggled with command, allowing five runs on four hits with two strikeouts and five walks in 4\u2153 innings. Lynn allowed four earned runs on four hits with four strikeouts and three walks in five-plus innings.\n\nKorey Lee's two-out, two-run single against Cardinals reliever Andrew Kittredge in the sixth tied the score at 5.

LOUIS -- The Cardinals stranded the bases loaded in the 10th inning after rain paused the game for 3 hours and 3 minutes in the middle of what ended up being the final at-bat of the game.\n\nHeavy rain accompanied by lightning forced the game to stop with two outs, men on every base and Nolan Gorman at the plate against former Cardinals pitcher and current Chicago White Sox reliever John Brebbia.\n\nWhen play resumed, Ivan Herrera pinch hit for Gorman and struck out looking against the White Sox new relief pitcher, left-hander Tanner Banks, and the Cardinals fell, 6-5, in front of what remained of an announced crowd of 38,559 at Busch Stadium for the second game of a three-game series on Saturday evening.\n\nFormer Cardinal Tommy Pham lined an RBI single into left field to drive in the automatic runner placed on second base to start extra innings, and that run provided the margin of victory for the White Sox. Cardinals rookie relief pitcher Ryan Fernandez allowed Pham's RBI single and took the loss.\n\nThe Cardinals (15-18) will try to secure their second straight series win at home with a victory on Sunday. Their last home series came against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 22-24, and they won two of three games in that series.\n\nThe White Sox (7-26) recorded just their second road win of the season. They're 2-14 away from Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago.\n\nCardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt started the 10th inning as the automatic runner on second base, Nolan Arenado singled and Alec Burleson reached on a fielder's choice when White Sox third baseman Bryan Ramos threw home with Goldschmidt caught between home and third.\n\nHowever, Ramos' throw to the plate was in the dirt, catcher Korey Lee couldn't field it cleanly and that allowed Goldschmidt to retreat to third base safely. That loaded the bases with no outs, but Lars Nootbaar struck out and extended his recent slump to 0 for 10 and Masyn Winn struck out and stretched his slump to 0 for 14. That set up Gorman's/Herrera's final at-bat.\n\nArenado continued what has become a breakout series with a 3-for-3 performance that included a three-run home run with two walks. Arenado drove in all three of the team's runs in Friday night's win.\n\nCardinals leadoff hitter Brendan Donovan went 1 for 5 with a double, a run scored and two RBIs.\n\nCardinals starting pitcher Lance Lynn allowed five runs (four earned) on four hits and three walks in five innings. He struck out four in a no decision.\n\nLynn pitched for the White Sox from 2021-2023, and he tied a franchise single-game record with 16 strikeouts against the Seattle Mariners in June of last year. In 70 starts with the White Sox, Lynn went 25-22 with a 4.23 ERA, a 1.29 WHIP, 444 strikeouts and 109 walks in 398 1/3 innings.\n\nLynn faced the White Sox for the first time since they traded him and reliever Joe Kelly to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 28, 2023.\n\nFirst-inning foibles for Lynn\n\nThe White Sox burst out of the gates quickly against their former teammate. The first three batters of the game reached safely against Lynn. Nicky Lopez's leadoff single started the game, and Lynn's former Cardinals teammate Pham walked to put two men on in front of Gavin Sheets.\n\nSheets doubled to left field and drove in Lopez. The White Sox put a run on the board before an out had been recorded. Eloy Jimenez then hit a sacrifice fly to center field as the White Sox traded an out for a run as they built a two-run lead within the first four batters of the game.\n\nThe White Sox, shut out for a MLB-high ninth time Friday night, snapped a string of 11 consecutive scoreless innings with those two first-inning runs. They entered the day ranked last in the majors in batting average with runners in scoring position (.190).\n\nThe White Sox scored their third run with the help of a Gorman fielding error at second base in the fourth inning. Andrew Benintendi singled, advanced on a groundout to first base and scored on the fielding error on a ball hit sharply off the bat of Lee.\n\nCardinals offense stalled early\n\nWhite Sox right-hander Erick Fedde held the Cardinals to one hit through the first four innings, including no hits in the second, third or fourth innings.\n\nThe Cardinals' first hit came on an Arenado opposite-field single in the first inning, and that came two batters after Willson Contreras walked to give them their first baserunner of the game.\n\nFedde allowed just two men to reach base between the end of the first inning and start of the fifth. Gorman drew the first of his two walks in the second, and Arenado drew a leadoff walk in the fourth.\n\nFedde had turned in a stellar outing in his previous start against Tampa Bay. He pitched into the ninth, struck out nine and allowed just two hits in that start.\n\nHowever, the Cardinals got to Fedde in a big way in the fifth.\n\nFedde chased by five-run fifth\n\nThe Cardinals trailed 3-0 going into the fifth. Gorman's second walk of the game started the inning and put the leadoff man on for the second consecutive inning.\n\nMichael Siani then swatted a single to right field for the Cardinals' first hit since the first inning. Gorman went from first to third on the play. Donovan then rifled a double just inside the first base line and into the right-field corner.\n\nGorman and Siani scored on Donovan's double and made it a one-run game.\n\nWith Gorman aboard, Contreras drew his second walk of the game to put two men on with no outs. The first four batters of the inning reached base against Fedde.\n\nThen Goldschmidt struck out swinging for the first out of the inning, and that brought Arenado to the plate with two men on base.\n\nArenado rocketed a 2-2 sinker left up and over the outer half of the plate into the center field stands for his second home run of the season. The three-run blast gave the Cardinals a 5-3 lead and marked the end of Fedde's outing.\n\nWalks made the Cardinals' lead short-lived\n\nTrying to protect a lead for the first time in the game, Lynn walked Sheets and Jimenez to start the sixth.\n\nAfter the back-to-back walks, Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol went to his bullpen and called upon Andrew Kittredge with no outs and two men on base.\n\nKittredge, who entered the day with a 0.75 ERA, retired the first two batters on a groundout and a fly ball to left field.\n\nWith two strikes, Lee punched a 3-1 slider back up the middle for a two-run single and tied the game. Lee had been 0 for 16 with two outs and runners in scoring position in his career prior to that single.\n\nBoth runs were charged to Lynn since the runners reached on his walks.\n\n\u00a92024 STLtoday.com.

Their last home series came against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 22-24, and they won two of three games in that series.\n\nThe White Sox (7-26) recorded just their second road win of the season. They're 2-14 away from Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago.\n\nCardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt started the 10th inning as the automatic runner on second base, Nolan Arenado singled and Alec Burleson reached on a fielder's choice when White Sox third baseman Bryan Ramos threw home with Goldschmidt caught between home and third.\n\nHowever, Ramos' throw to the plate was in the dirt, catcher Korey Lee couldn't field it cleanly and that allowed Goldschmidt to retreat to third base safely. That loaded the bases with no outs, but Lars Nootbaar struck out and extended his recent slump to 0 for 10 and Masyn Winn struck out and stretched his slump to 0 for 14. That set up Gorman's/Herrera's final at-bat.\n\nArenado continued what has become a breakout series with a 3-for-3 performance that included a three-run home run with two walks.

He struck out four in a no decision.\n\nLynn pitched for the White Sox from 2021-2023, and he tied a franchise single-game record with 16 strikeouts against the Seattle Mariners in June of last year. In 70 starts with the White Sox, Lynn went 25-22 with a 4.23 ERA, a 1.29 WHIP, 444 strikeouts and 109 walks in 398 1/3 innings.\n\nLynn faced the White Sox for the first time since they traded him and reliever Joe Kelly to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 28, 2023.\n\nFirst inning foibles for Lynn\n\nThe White Sox burst out of the gates quickly against their former teammate. The first three batters of the game reached safely against Lynn. Nicky Lopez's leadoff single started the game, and Lynn's former Cardinals teammate Tommy Pham walked to put two men on in front of Gavin Sheets.\n\nSheets doubled to left field and drove in Lopez. The White Sox put a run on the board before an out had been recorded. Eloy Jimenez then hit a sacrifice fly to center field as the White Sox traded an out for a run as they built a two-run lead within the first four batters of the game.\n\nThe White Sox, shut out for a MLB-high ninth on Friday night, snapped a string of 11 consecutive scoreless innings with those two first-inning runs.

The game stopped at that point and the outcome hung in the balance as rain pummeled the field for the next three hours.\n\nWhen play resumed, the White Sox turned to left-handed reliever Tanner Banks and the Cardinals countered by pinch-hitting for Gorman with right-handed hitting backup catcher Ivan Herrera.\n\nAlready down in the count 0-1, Herrera swung and missed on the first pitch he saw from Banks, then took a borderline pitch for a ball. Herrera fouled off the next pitch, a changeup, but got called out on strike three by home plate umpire CB Bucknor. The called third strike appeared farther off the plate than the borderline pitch called for a ball two pitches earlier.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Pro-Palestinian protests block traffic outside Washington University Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nHerrera's strikeout wrapped up the Cardinals' 6-5 loss to the White Sox in 10 innings in front of what remained of an announced crowd of 38,559 at Busch Stadium.\n\nThe loss sets up a rubber match between the teams at 1:15 p.m. Sunday, and left-hander Matthew Liberatore will make his first start of the season for the Cardinals (15-18).\n\n\"You know they only have one guy left,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said of the way the game unfolded at the delay. \"They're going to go to the lefty. He's punching out lefties 34 percent of the time. You have a right-handed bat that you feel really good with, Herrera.\n\n\"You wait three hours and you want it to be determined between the pitcher and the hitter. That wasn't the case.\"\n\nWhile Herrera's at-bat provided the final out of the game, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs in the 10th when they needed one run to tie and two to win the game. They struck out three times with the game on the line, including the final out.\n\nFormer Cardinal and recent White Sox addition Tommy Pham provided the margin of victory with a one-out RBI single in the top of the 10th inning that drove in the automatic runner/ghost runner. His single came against Cardinals rookie reliever Ryan Fernandez.\n\nCardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt started the bottom of the 10th as the automatic runner on second base, Nolan Arenado singled and Alec Burleson reached on a fielder's choice when White Sox third baseman Bryan Ramos threw home with Goldschmidt drawing a throw to the plate.\n\nHowever, Ramos' throw went in the dirt, White Sox catcher Korey Lee couldn't field it cleanly and that allowed Goldschmidt to retreat to third base safely.\n\nThat loaded the bases with no outs, but Lars Nootbaar struck out and extended his recent slump to 0 for 10 and Masyn Winn struck out and stretched his slump to 0 for 14. That set up the Gorman/Herrera final at-bat.\n\n\"The at-bats, obviously, needed to be better,\" Marmol said. \"They were frustrated with it. They obviously wanted to come through there, but we didn't. We had an opportunity to wrap that up and we missed it.\"\n\nThe White Sox (7-26) recorded just their second road win of the season. They're 2-14 away from Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago.\n\nArenado continued what has become a breakout series with a 3-for-3 performance that included a three-run home run with two walks. Arenado drove in all three of the team's runs in Friday night's win. He's now batting .296 for the season. The home run was his second this season.\n\n\"(The frustration level) is high, and it should be high,\" Arenado said. \"Guys shouldn't be OK with what's going on right now. We've got a lot of games left, but that's just an ongoing excuse. We can't continue to use that. We know there's a better feeling there, and we've just got to continue to push.\"\n\nThe Cardinals scored all five of their runs in the fifth inning, and they collected three of their five hits in that same inning.\n\nThey were 3 for 13 with runners in scoring position, and they left 10 men on base.\n\nArenado described the offense coming up empty in the bottom of the 10th as \"brutal.\"\n\n\"It stings,\" Arenado said. \"But if we continue to put ourselves in this position with the tying run on third or no outs -- if we continue to do this -- good things are going to happen because sooner or later it's going to flip because we're going to feel really good and we're going to be driving in those runs.\"\n\nThe Cardinals faced an early deficit after starting pitcher Lance Lynn gave up two first-inning runs to his former club.\n\nLynn pitched for the White Sox from 2021-2023, and he tied a franchise single-game record with 16 strikeouts against the Seattle Mariners in June of last year. In 70 starts with the White Sox, Lynn went 25-22 with a 4.23 ERA, a 1.29 WHIP, 444 strikeouts and 109 walks in 398 1/3 innings.\n\nLynn faced the White Sox for the first time since they traded him and reliever Joe Kelly to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 28, 2023.\n\nThe first three batters of the game reached base against Lynn via a Nicky Lopez leadoff single, a Pham walk and a Gavin Sheets RBI double. Eloy Jimenez's sacrifice fly drove in the other run.\n\nA Gorman fielding error led to an unearned run in the fourth inning, and the Cardinals trailed 3-0 going into the fifth inning against White Sox starter Erick Fedde.\n\nHowever, the Cardinals got more than a little bit of traction against Fedde in the fifth. Gorman drew a leadoff walk, followed by a Michael Siani single -- the Cardinals' first hit since the first inning -- and that set up a two-run double rifled down the line and just inside of first base by Brendan Donovan.\n\nDonovan's double made it a one-run game, and Willson Contreras walked for the second time in the game to put the go-ahead run on base. Following a Goldschmidt strikeout, Arenado hammered a 2-2 sinker left up and over the outer half of the plate.\n\nArenado's blast traveled an estimated 412 feet to center field for a three-run home run. That put the Cardinals in front 5-3.\n\nLynn couldn't hold onto the lead. He walked the first two batters of the sixth inning, and reliever Andrew Kittredge came within one out of stranding both men on base. Instead, Lee hit a two-out single up the middle that tied the game in the sixth and set the stage for extra innings after neither team scored in the seventh, eighth or ninth innings.\n\n\"It wasn't a good day for me, there's no other way to say it,\" Lynn said. \"The team got me five runs, then I turn around and walk the two guys in the top of the sixth. All in all, I've got to be better from the get-go.\"\n\nScore goes here\n\nUp next: 1:15 p.m. Sunday, BSM\n\nTBA for Cards vs. Crochet (1-4, 5.97)\n\nExtra: xxx, D5\n\n0 Comments Tags St Louis

LOUIS (AP) -- Eloy Jimenez homered and Garrett Crochet tossed six effective innings to help the Chicago White Sox to a 5-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.\n\nChicago had lost 14 of its first 16 road games this season, Paul DeJong added a run-scoring double for the White Sox, who won their first road series of the season. He spent seven seasons in St. Louis from 2017-2023.\n\nWillson Contreras homered for St. Louis, which has lost four of five.\n\nJimenez hit his fourth of the season off reliever Giovanny Gallegos (2-1) to snap a 1-1 tie leading off the seventh inning. The drive kick-started a four-run outburst.\n\n\"We've had a tough start at the beginning, but right now we've been playing better baseball,\" Jimenez said. \"Now, we're showing what we can do.\"\n\nCrochet (2-4) allowed one run on three hits. He had given up 16 earned runs in 16 2/3 innings over his previous four starts. He struck out six and did not walk a batter.\n\n\"My slider shape was back,\" Crochet said. \"Today, I was able to compete in the zone with my heater. I was getting it away, getting it up and in. That helped them, not sit on one pitch.\"\n\nCrotchet got hit on the ankle by a line drive off the bat on Lars Nootbaar in the third inning. He shook it off and after a couple warmup tosses, he was good to go.\n\n\"His performance today was gutty,\" Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. \"He got smoked on that line drive. For him to stay in, and do what he did and finish off the way he finished off, was tremendous,\"\n\nCrotchet, who missed the entire 2022 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, has 53 strikeouts on the season and is the first Chicago pitcher to pass the 50-strikeout mark over his first eight starts.\n\n\"Let's keep it rolling,\" Crochet said.\n\nBryan Ramos recorded his first RBI with a sacrifice fly in the second in his first major league at-bat.

They're not going to remake their entire roster, and they've already tried moving struggling hitters down in the lineup. Though, that's getting tougher to do as most of the lineup could currently be considered struggling.\n\nThere also seems no immediate inclination to replace members of the coaching staff, and there's not a savior in the minor leagues knocking at the door with the ability to transform the entire offense.\n\nThe Cardinals know they've got to turn around a struggling offense, among the bottom three in the majors in runs scored, with the resources currently at their disposal.\n\nIt's simply not happening, and that lack of offense manifested itself in a 5-1 loss to the lowly Chicago White Sox in a series-deciding game in front of an announced crowd of 43,046 at Busch Stadium on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations.

Media Views: Battlehawks dominate spring football in attendance, but no longer in TV ratings St. Louis Aldermanic President Megan Green says WashU lying about reason for her suspension\n\n\"We've had months like this before where it doesn't look very good and then we come out of it,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"We need to come out of it. A day like today, a series like this one -- you've got to figure out a way to take this series. We didn't. We didn't even give ourselves opportunities today.\"\n\nThe Cardinals (15-19) collected just four hits, and they did not draw a walk. They had one at-bat in the game with a runner in scoring position and went 0 for 1. Their lone run came on a fourth-inning solo home run by Willson Contreras, his team-leading sixth home run of the season.\n\nWith the loss, the Cardinals slipped behind the Pittsburgh Pirates (16-19) into last place in the NL Central Division.\n\nThe White Sox (8-27) entered the weekend with just one road win this season, but they took two of three from the Cardinals at Busch Stadium for their first series win since they swept the Tampa Bay Rays on April 26-28 in Chicago.\n\nThis season, the White Sox had won just one series and split one series in their 10 previous series entering the weekend. They've gotten off to the worst 34-game start in their franchise's history.\n\nThe lone run for the Cardinals came on a solo home run by designated hitter Willson Contreras in the fourth inning. The Cardinals had just four hits in the game.\n\nAside from Contreras, the Cardinals only other hits were infield singles from Brendan Donovan (1 for 4), Masyn Winn (1 for 3) and Lars Nootbaar (1 for 3).\n\nWinn snapped an 0-for-16 slump with his infield single, while Nootbaar snapped an 0-for-10 stretch with a single lined off the leg of White Sox starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in the third inning.\n\n\"There's no panic,\" Donovan said. \"Obviously, you have some pissed off guys in this clubhouse, but, you know, when you get kicked in the face you've just got to continue to show up. So that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nThe Cardinals began the day near the bottom of the majors in batting average (.217, tied for 27th out of 30), slugging percentage (.333, 28th) and runs per game (3.55, 28th).\n\nWhite Sox starter Crochet (2-4) had gone 0-3 with a 10.26 ERA in his previous four starts. He held the Cardinals to one run on three hits in six innings.\n\n\"Our offensive struggles the last couple days or however long you think it has been, it's not on them,\" Donovan said of the coaching staff. \"They do a great job, and they put us in a position to be successful. It's completely on the players to go out there and do our jobs.\"\n\nAsked about the potential of changing the \"voices\" tasked with getting the offense on track, a reference to hitting coach Turner Ward, assistant hitting coach Brandon Allen and game planning coach Packy Elkins, Marmol backed his coaches.\n\n\"I like the voices we have,\" Marmol said. \"I can't speak higher of Turner, BA and Packy and what they do in that department. No one is getting a whole lot of sleep right now, I'll tell you that. They're working at it. They're trying to make sure they're not missing anything. The communication with the players is really good. It sucks. Bottom line. It just does.\n\n\"Yes, we continue to look at everything possible to make sure we get out of this. But these are the players we're going to win with, and we need to get them going.\"\n\nWith the Cardinals offense scuffling, the White Sox broke-open a tie game with a four-run seventh inning.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Matthew Liberatore made the spot start in place of injured left-hander Steven Matz, who went on the injured list with a lower back strain on Friday. He allowed one run on five hits in 3 2/3 innings and struck out five.\n\nRight-handed reliever Kyle Leahy held the line in relief of Liberatore. Leahy turned in his best outing in the majors with 2 1/3 scoreless innings. Leahy did not allow a hit or a walk, and he struck out two batters.\n\nContreras' home run in the fourth inning tied the score 1-1, but the White Sox made noise against right-handed reliever Giovanny Gallegos in the seventh inning.\n\nA workhorse of the bullpen at one time (186 appearances from 2021-23), Gallegos entered the day with an ERA of 9.00 this season in 12 games. He'd allowed nine runs in nine hits and four of the 11 hits he allowed were home runs.\n\nGallegos got ahead of White Sox cleanup hitter Eloy Jimenez 0-2, but then threw a slider for a ball. He came back with a four-seam fastball on the next pitch, but the 91.3-mph pitch sailed in the upper third of the strike zone and over the outer half of the plate.\n\nJimenez mashed the pitch 411 feet for a solo home run to center field. That gave the White Sox the lead, and they did not relinquish the lead for the rest of the day.\n\nGavin Sheets followed with a double, and former Cardinal Paul DeJong doubled to drive in Sheets and mark the end of Gallegos' outing.\n\nGallegos (2-1) faced the minimum of three batters, gave up three extra-base hits and all three batters scored in the inning.\n\nLeft-hander John King took over after Gallegos, and he gave up a pair of singles, including a one-out RBI single by Braden Shewmake. DeJong scored on Shewmake's single to account for the third run charged to Gallegos. King gave up one run of his own in the inning on a sacrifice fly by Robbie Grossman.\n\nGrossman's sacrifice fly made the score 5-1.\n\n0 Comments Tags St Louis Cardinals Cardinals Baseball Oliver

The Cards' offense just couldn't muster significant production at the plate, while their bullpen struggled to suppress the White Sox's bats.\n\nCardinals' Oliver Marmol sounds off on losing series finale vs White Sox\n\nCoupled with the Pittsburgh Pirates winning against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, 5-3, the Cardinals' loss has St. Louis now finding itself wallowing at the bottom of the National League Central division with just a 15-9 record. Losing to a White Sox squad twice in three games in a series must be an eye-opener as much as it is a wake-up call for the Cardinals. No team has struggled more this season than the White Sox, who entered the Cardinals series with just six wins, but Chicago found a way to win the set outright against St. Louis.\n\nCardinals manager Oliver Marmol is very much aware of his team's brutal season that just got worse after a pair of embarrassing losses to the team with the worst record in the big leagues, and he knows that it would take great patience for St. Louis to get it together.\n\n\"You've got to keep working,\" Marmol said after the game, per the Associated Press (h/t ESPN). \"The bottom line. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's all we can do is continue to work.\"\n\nThe White Sox series started just fine for the Cardinals, with St. Louis taking a 3-0 win in the opener. In the second leg of the series, Cardinals starter Lance Lynn struggled on the mound, allowing five earned runs on four hits with three walks in 5.0 innings of work in the aforementioned loss.\n\nDuring the finale, relief pitcher Matthew Liberatore got a spot start for the Cardinals and pitched well in 3.2 innings, allowing just an earned run on three hits. It started to turn bad for the Cards when Giovanny Gallegos allowed three earned runs on three hits. St. Louis' bullpen hasn't been exactly glorious in the 2024 MLB season and it showed in Sunday's defeat at the hands of the White Sox. On the season, St. Louis is 15th in the majors with a 3.78 relief pitchers ERA, though, the team is 11th overall with a bullpen WHIP of 1.20.\n\nChicago is the worst in the majors with just a .597 OPS, but the White Sox did not have to make a giant leap in that area to defeat the Cardinals. After all, St. Louis is the worst non-White Sox team in the big leagues with just a .624 OPS at the time of this writing. St. Louis' only run in the final game of the series came off of a solo home run by Willson Contreras in the fourth inning.\n\nHaving lost four of their last five games, the Cardinals will look to get it together and return to the win column as soon as Monday night when St. Louis opens a three-game series, still at home, against the visiting New York Mets. That sounds like a good series for the Cardinals to begin turning things around as they defeated the Mets in a three-game series in Queens late last April.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com",

They crafted an excellent comeback, starting in the sixth inning. Korey Lee hit a two-run RBI single to tie the game. In extra innings, newly signed and promoted Tommy Pham drove in the go-ahead run to put them in a position to close the game out.\n\nThat's when things went south.\n\nAt around 4:30 p.m. in St. Louis, White Sox reliever John Brebbia attempted to get out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the 10th inning accompanied by unrelenting rain and lightning. Brebbia was switching balls nearly every pitch, making the walk to Lee to try and cover the ball away from the rain.\n\nBrebbia, with no outs, bases loaded, and downpouring rain, struck out both Lars Nootbaar and Masyn Winn to give the Sox two outs.\n\n\"I thought Brebbia striking out those two guys in that kind of weather was really unbelievable,\" Pedro Grifol said after the game.\n\nFinally, Brebbia had Nolan Gorman down one strike when the officials declared a rain delay on the field. But not without some pushback from Brebbia, first.\n\n\"I said 'Don't you dare stop this game. Just keep it going,'\" Brebbia said after the game. \"I don't know what they said back to me. I know that they wanted to say 'You're an idiot, we're gonna stop it.' But I did my best to just kinda keep it going so that we didn't have to wait around for hours to finally finish it.\"\n\nBrebbia wasn't able to strike out Gorman fast enough.\n\nThat began a three-hour rain delay in St. Louis; but not without drama, either. The grounds crew took off the tarp a few times, teasing the resumption of the game. But as John Schriffen said on the NBC Sports Chicago broadcast, every time the teams aimed for another start time, heavy rain began to pour again.\n\nThe players did a variety of things while they waited. Brebbia recalls pitchers --- who had already thrown ---beginning their postgame recovery programs. Some card games unfolded. Some naps were taken. But the White Sox, as a whole, remained focused, despite having been at the field since 8 a.m.\n\n\"In that three-hour and three-minute delay, they stayed focused,\" Grifol said. \"They had their fun and all in here and all that stuff but they stayed focused.\"\n\nFinally, both teams emerged onto the field aiming for a 7:30 p.m. restart --- three hours after the game was delayed due to rain, and over six hours after the game first started at 1:15 p.m.\n\nWith Brebbia on the sidelines for three hours, the White Sox sent Tanner Banks to the bump --- the only pitcher available from the bullpen. In five pitches, including a questionably placed fifth-pitch changeup, Banks struck out pinch-hitter Ivan Herrera.\n\n\"It was a coin toss. We had an attack strategy for either of the potential hitters,\" Banks said postgame. \"Just attack. The general mindset of pitchers is to make your pitches and compete and battle. Fortunately, I came in with one strike, so one pitch, 0-2. Then you get to kinda play that game a little bit; the chess game of pitching.\"\n\nAfter the rain delay, the game probably lasted five or less minutes. But the White Sox celebrated with some emphatic hugs and high-fives after waiting over three hours to resume. That'll bring a team together.\n\nNo game has been easy for the White Sox this season, who have been shut out the most times through a 33-game span in MLB history (9). Amid a dramatic rebuild, the White Sox own the league's worst record by one game over the Rockies.\n\nAnd the baseball Gods have refused to spare the White Sox any favor this season, handing them injuries to their three best players, nine shutouts through 20% of the season, and a three-hour rain delay on the cusp of victory.\n\nJust when they could taste their seventh victory of the season and a chance to snap their nine-game road losing streak, the opportunity was ripped away from them for hours.\n\nBut they held strong.

They rallied to take a 5-3 lead on Saturday afternoon before the White Sox came back to record a 6-5 victory in 10 innings to snap their four-game losing streak.\n\nSt. Louis loaded the bases with nobody out in the bottom of the 10th inning before White Sox reliever John Brebbia struck out Lars Nootbaar and Masyn Winn as a torrential downpour hit Busch Stadium.\n\nBrebbia recorded a strike on Nolan Gorman before he walked off the mound and protested the rapidly deteriorating conditions. The umpiring crew stopped play, and White Sox reliever Tanner Bates struck out pinch-hitter Ivan Herrera after a three-hour delay to end the marathon.\n\n\"The at-bats obviously needed to be better,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"They were frustrated with it. They obviously want to come through there but didn't. We had an opportunity wrap that up, and we missed it.\"\n\nMarmol has switched up his starting rotation with Steven Matz on the 15-day injured rotation. Left-hander Matthew Liberatore (1-1, 2.76 ERA) is expected to come out of the bullpen to take Sunday's start.\n\nThis will be his first career appearance against the White Sox.\n\nThe Cardinals are expected to adjust their roster ahead of Sunday's game by activating outfielder Dylan Carlson from the injured list and sending third catcher Pedro Pages back to Memphis.\n\nThe White Sox will close this series with promising left-hander Garrett Crochet (1-4, 5.97 ERA), who was a first-round pick in the 2020 draft.\n\nAfter allowing 17 runs in 11 2/3 innings in his previous three starts, Crochet got back on track on Monday against the Minnesota Twins. He allowed two runs on two hits in five innings during a no-decision.\n\n\"He's doing a really good job of pitching. Everybody knows he's got incredible stuff, elite stuff,\" White Sox manager Pedro Grifol said. \"But the one thing that's been impressive is his ability to mix in four pitches, throw strikes, not walk guys, get strikeouts when he needs them. For me, this was a critical start.\"\n\nCrochet struck out seven and walked one during that 77-pitch outing vs. the Twins. He wanted to go further, but Grifol and pitching coach Ethan Katz pulled him as part of their larger plan to manage his workload during his first full season as a starter.\n\n\"I was frustrated just because of the road trip we just went on, I took part in wearing out the bullpen a good bit,\" Crochet said. \"I felt like this was a good chance for me to save them. I had the long second (inning), but I was able to be efficient after that.\"\n\nIn his one career appearance against the Cardinals, he faced three batters and allowed one hit and two walks.\n\nChicago's bullpen took a hit after Dominic Leone exited the game with an injury after walking Nolan Arenado in the eighth inning.\n\nThe White Sox made a roster move before the game Saturday, promoting Bryan Ramos from Double-A Birmingham after fellow infielder Danny Mendick went on the 10-day injured list with an ailing back.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri":

Took his shot and hit a big homer for us to take the lead... He's doing a really nice job.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Arenado finally hit his second home run of the season for the Cardinals in a breakout game.

We're really hard on ourselves and expect to do great things. And when you struggle, age is always talked about.\"\n\nArenado also said that he's been through cold starts before. The Cardinals star is confident that he'll be able to bounce back, but he does acknowledge that he's found it harder to get going.\n\n\"Listen, I've gotten off to slow starts the last two years, and it's frustrating. I don't know what it is. When I was younger, I had a few years when I really got off to really good starts. And as I've gotten older, it's always been a little harder to get going.

Left hander Matthew Liberatore will make his first start of the season in what looks like it will be a bullpen game for the Cardinals.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sampson@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Peter Sampson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Liberatore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Liberatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Lynn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Lynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nolan-Arenado-gets-eye-opening-Oliver-Marmol-claim-after-brutal-loss-to-White-Sox.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540026", "eventUri": "eng-9540026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

They're not going to remake their entire roster, and they've already tried moving struggling hitters down in the lineup. Though, that's getting tougher to do as most of the lineup could currently be considered struggling.\n\nThere also seems no immediate inclination to replace members of the coaching staff, and there's not a savior in the minor leagues knocking at the door with the ability to transform the entire offense.\n\nThe Cardinals know they've got to turn around a struggling offense, among the bottom three in the majors in runs scored, with the resources currently at their disposal.\n\nIt's simply not happening, and that lack of offense manifested itself in a 5-1 loss to the lowly Chicago White Sox in a series-deciding game in front of an announced crowd of 43,046 at Busch Stadium on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\n\"We've had months like this before where it doesn't look very good and then we come out of it,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"We need to come out of it. A day like today, a series like this one -- you've got to figure out a way to take this series. We didn't. We didn't even give ourselves opportunities today.\"\n\nThe Cardinals (15-19) collected just four hits, and they did not draw a walk. They had one at-bat in the game with a runner in scoring position and went 0 for 1. Their lone run came on a fourth-inning solo home run by Willson Contreras, his team-leading sixth home run of the season.\n\nWith the loss, the Cardinals slipped behind the Pittsburgh Pirates (16-19) into last place in the NL Central Division.\n\nThe White Sox (8-27) entered the weekend with just one road win this season, but they took two of three from the Cardinals at Busch Stadium for their first series win since they swept the Tampa Bay Rays on April 26-28 in Chicago.\n\nThis season, the White Sox had won just one series and split one series in their 10 previous series entering the weekend. They've gotten off to the worst 34-game start in their franchise's history.\n\nThe lone run for the Cardinals came on a solo home run by designated hitter Willson Contreras in the fourth inning. The Cardinals had just four hits in the game.\n\nAside from Contreras, the Cardinals only other hits were infield singles from Brendan Donovan (1 for 4), Masyn Winn (1 for 3) and Lars Nootbaar (1 for 3).\n\nWinn snapped an 0-for-16 slump with his infield single, while Nootbaar snapped an 0-for-10 stretch with a single lined off the leg of White Sox starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in the third inning.\n\n\"There's no panic,\" Donovan said. \"Obviously, you have some pissed off guys in this clubhouse, but, you know, when you get kicked in the face you've just got to continue to show up. So that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nThe Cardinals began the day near the bottom of the majors in batting average (.217, tied for 27th out of 30), slugging percentage (.333, 28th) and runs per game (3.55, 28th).\n\nWhite Sox starter Crochet (2-4) had gone 0-3 with a 10.26 ERA in his previous four starts. He held the Cardinals to one run on three hits in six innings.\n\n\"Our offensive struggles the last couple days or however long you think it has been, it's not on them,\" Donovan said of the coaching staff. \"They do a great job, and they put us in a position to be successful. It's completely on the players to go out there and do our jobs.\"\n\nAsked about the potential of changing the \"voices\" tasked with getting the offense on track, a reference to hitting coach Turner Ward, assistant hitting coach Brandon Allen and game planning coach Packy Elkins, Marmol backed his coaches.\n\n\"I like the voices we have,\" Marmol said. \"I can't speak higher of Turner, BA and Packy and what they do in that department. No one is getting a whole lot of sleep right now, I'll tell you that. They're working at it. They're trying to make sure they're not missing anything. The communication with the players is really good. It sucks. Bottom line. It just does.\n\n\"Yes, we continue to look at everything possible to make sure we get out of this. But these are the players we're going to win with, and we need to get them going.\"\n\nWith the Cardinals offense scuffling, the White Sox broke-open a tie game with a four-run seventh inning.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Matthew Liberatore made the spot start in place of injured left-hander Steven Matz, who went on the injured list with a lower back strain on Friday. He allowed one run on five hits in 3 2/3 innings and struck out five.\n\nRight-handed reliever Kyle Leahy held the line in relief of Liberatore. Leahy turned in his best outing in the majors with 2 1/3 scoreless innings. Leahy did not allow a hit or a walk, and he struck out two batters.\n\nContreras' home run in the fourth inning tied the score 1-1, but the White Sox made noise against right-handed reliever Giovanny Gallegos in the seventh inning.\n\nA workhorse of the bullpen at one time (186 appearances from 2021-23), Gallegos entered the day with an ERA of 9.00 this season in 12 games. He'd allowed nine runs in nine hits and four of the 11 hits he allowed were home runs.\n\nGallegos got ahead of White Sox cleanup hitter Eloy Jimenez 0-2, but then threw a slider for a ball. He came back with a four-seam fastball on the next pitch, but the 91.3-mph pitch sailed in the upper third of the strike zone and over the outer half of the plate.\n\nJimenez mashed the pitch 411 feet for a solo home run to center field. That gave the White Sox the lead, and they did not relinquish the lead for the rest of the day.\n\nGavin Sheets followed with a double, and former Cardinal Paul DeJong doubled to drive in Sheets and mark the end of Gallegos' outing.\n\nGallegos (2-1) faced the minimum of three batters, gave up three extra-base hits and all three batters scored in the inning.\n\nLeft-hander John King took over after Gallegos, and he gave up a pair of singles, including a one-out RBI single by Braden Shewmake. DeJong scored on Shewmake's single to account for the third run charged to Gallegos. King gave up one run of his own in the inning on a sacrifice fly by Robbie Grossman.\n\nGrossman's sacrifice fly made the score 5-1.\n\n0 Comments Tags St Louis Cardinals Cardinals Baseball Oliver

LOUIS -- The talking point of the St. Louis Cardinals' 6-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox in 10 innings on Saturday will center on the timing of a sudden rain delay.\n\nDespite 80-degree weather and blue skies for most of the game, a monstrous thunderstorm descended over downtown St. Louis just before 4:30 p.m. At the same time, the ballgame had reached its most pivotal point. The Cardinals, down one run, had loaded the bases with nobody out in the bottom of the 10th inning. The White Sox, who entered play Saturday as owners of one of the worst records in baseball at 6-26, responded by recording two outs, bringing the game to its final batter.\n\nThe scene made for peak drama, but Mother Nature had other plans. Crew chief Dan Iassogna suspended play midway through Nolan Gorman's at-bat as sheets of rain pelted Busch Stadium. What followed was a three-hour and three-minute rain delay before the game's final out could be played.\n\nBut for the Cardinals, the rain delay should have never taken place. They had ample opportunity to win the game outright, long before the storm clouds rolled in.\n\n\"We load the bases and then just didn't take quality at-bats after that in order to be able to give ourselves a chance,\" Cardinals manager Oli Marmol said after the loss. \"That's the bottom line. There's no excuse for it. The game should end there.\"\n\nBecause of how hard the ball was hit, Goldschmidt broke for home to eliminate the chance of the White Sox turning a 5-4-3 double play. The thought process here is that if Chicago did indeed turn that double play, the Cardinals are left with two outs and a runner on third, which doesn't make for a high-probability scoring situation. By risking the lead runner instead, St. Louis can maximize its scoring chances even if Goldschmidt is thrown out, as they'd have two runners on base with just one out.\n\nIt's a scenario the Cardinals practice regularly, and it worked in their favor immensely when Ortega rushed his throw to home. The ball bounced in the dirt for a throwing error, allowing Goldschmidt to retreat to third, while Arenado and Burleson reached second and first base safely.\n\nIt's here where the Cardinals spoiled their best chances to win. A ball that leaves the infield most likely scores a run, and even a double-play ball, while not ideal, ties the game. Instead, their next two hitters, Lars Nootbaar and Masyn Winn, struck out swinging. That left the game in Gorman's hands as rain began to pelt Busch Stadium. Brebbia laid in a first-pitch strike to Gorman, but the weather conditions became so severe that he couldn't get a dry baseball. It was then that the umpiring crew decided to suspend play.\n\nDuring that 60 seconds or so of resumed play, the White Sox turned to their only remaining reliever, left-hander Tanner Banks, and Marmol opted to play the splits and subbed in Iv\u00e1n Herrera for Gorman. Herrera saw four pitches before being rung up by home-plate umpire C.B. Bucknor on a ball outside the zone. But that was hardly the play that decided the game. The Cardinals' inability to score before the rain delay ultimately decided their fate.\n\n\"I chased a pitch under the zone,\" Nootbaar said. \"I didn't get a good pitch to hit (on the) first pitch, saw another one, fouled a fastball off and then chased. In that situation, I have to be better.\n\n\"One thing you do is obviously re-evaluate your game,\" he added. \"I haven't been perfect by any means. Far from it.\"\n\nThe Cardinals' inability to cash in has been their theme of the season. Offensive woes have plagued their lineup, but over the past week, a few players looked close to turning the corner. Arenado was one of those players, and after driving two doubles and plating all the Cardinals' runs in a 3-0 win Friday, he put up an even better performance on Saturday. Arenado reached base safely all five times, and his go-ahead three-run homer topped off a five-run fifth that propelled the Cardinals back into the ballgame.\n\nBut starting pitcher Lance Lynn walked the first two batters he faced in the sixth and both runners would come around to score, quickly knotting things at 5-5. The score remained there through nine innings, but St. Louis liked its chances, even when Chicago scored its automatic runner in the top of the 10th.\n\nQuickly though, they saw those chances unravel.\n\n\"It was brutal,\" Arenado said. \"It was tough. Brebbia did a good job, made some good pitches, and guys aren't feeling very comfortable either. It's tough. We want those guys hitting in those positions, and we have to find a way to be better. But it's not from a lack of effort.\"\n\nTrue, how the Cardinals have performed this season is not a reflection of effort. Despite a pitching staff that has exceeded expectations and a defense that ranks among the league's best, the Cardinals haven't been able to secure winnable ballgames. Of their 33 games this season, 25 have been decided by three runs or fewer (the second-most in baseball). With their loss on Saturday, St. Louis is now 13-12 in those games and 15-18 overall, a record that would look vastly different if they had been able to score consistently.\n\nInstead, the Cardinals will fight Sunday to salvage a series win against a feeble opponent. They'll get a boost to their lineup, as Dylan Carlson is expected to be activated off the injured list ahead of Sunday's game after missing the first month of the season with a sprained AC joint. But they're also down a starting pitcher with Steven Matz hurt, and will use Matthew Liberatore to open a bullpen game.\n\nEither way, the biggest improvement the Cardinals need is from their bats.\n\n\"Everything else is looking pretty darn good,\" Marmol said. \"But at-bats-wise, quality at-bats and stringing them together and production from our left-handed batters, you just go down the line and it's been a little bit of a rut right now.

Some people might say \"it's only early May and there's still 135 games of runway left in the season,\" which is understandable enough, but anyone and everyone in the Cardinals' camp has to be hugely concerned with this team's position right now.\n\nThe Cardinals are not an elite team, and no one entered this season thinking St. Louis would dominate the competition in a wide-open National League Central Division race. Everyone knows that the three best teams in the National League are the Dodgers, Phillies and Braves in some order. The Cardinals, even in a best-case scenario, were going to be no better than the fourth- or fifth-best team in the Senior Circuit. However, through the first five and a half weeks of the season, everything feels an awful lot like 2023. The Cardinals have some big names on their roster, but they aren't producing at the level they should be. Paul Goldschmidt is having an awful season. Lars Nootbaar is producing some bad situational at-bats in high-leverage moments, such as this past Saturday in the bottom of the 10th inning in a horrific loss to the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe Cardinals lost two out of three to the White Sox, becoming the first MLB team in 2024 to drop back-to-back home games against the Pale Hose. That's a completely unacceptable result which has to become a wake-up call for a slumberig team going nowhere quickly. The Cardinals are once again in last place in the N.L. Central, several games under .500. The National League -- at the moment -- has five clear-cut playoff-quality teams, and the Cardinals are not one of them. If St. Louis can't get above the .500 mark by Memorial Day, the Cardinals will face a very steep uphill climb in the summer to try to get into position for the final National League wild card berth.\n\nThe New York Mets aren't having as bad a season as the Cardinals are, but they just endured an absolutely brutal weekend against the Tampa Bay Rays. They got swept on Sunday because star closer Edwin Diaz allowed a two-out, game-tying home run to Randy Arozarena in the bottom of the ninth. New York couldn't protect a 5-4 lead and had to go to extra innings. The Mets took a 6-5 lead in the 10th inning but gave it up in the bottom of the 10th, falling 7-6. The Mets have to dust themselves off and bounce back against the struggling Cardinals.\n\nTV: SNY (Mets) / Bally Sports Midwest (Cardinals) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe Cardinals are a bad team. They just lost two of three at home to the pathetic Chicago White Sox. As noted above, the Cardinals became the first MLB team this year to lose consecutive home games to the White Sox. What's worse for St. Louis is how anemic its offense is. The Cardinals scored a total of nine runs in three games against White Sox pitching at home. If you take away a five-run fifth inning from Saturday's game versus Chicago, the Cardinals scored a total of four runs in 26 of the 27 innings they played against the White Sox. They had a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the bottom of the 10th on Saturday against the Sox and could not score. Situational hitting and crunch-time offense are nowhere to be found for a last-place team. Compared to the Mets, the Cardinals are in much worse shape.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe Cardinals are not good, but the Mets are reeling after their Sunday bullpen woes and their brutal weekend against the Tampa Bay Rays. New York is playing bad baseball, and that's the best reason to go with St. Louis.\n\nFinal Mets-Cardinals Prediction & Pick\n\nNeither team is remotely reliable.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nThe lone run for the Cardinals came on a solo home run by designated hitter Willson Contreras in the fourth inning. The Cardinals had just four hits in the game. Brendan Donovan, Masyn Winn and Lars Nootbaar each had hits.\n\nWinn snapped and 0-for-16 slump with his infield single, while Nootbaar snapped an 0-for-10 stretch with a single lined off the leg of White Sox starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in the third inning.\n\nLiberatore gave the Cardinals a chance\n\nCardinals left-hander Matthew Liberatore made the spot start in place of injured left-hander Steven Matz, who went on the injured list with a lower back strain on Friday. Liberatore had pitched well out of the bullpen this season, and he compiled a 1-1 record with a 2.76 ERA in 12 relief appearances this season.\n\nHis longest previous out of this season came during the club's most recent road trip when he pitched three innings of innings in relief in an extra-inning loss against the New York Mets at Citi Field on April 28.\n\nOn Sunday, Liberatore entered the day with a pitch count limit of approximately 50 pitches. He pitched 3 2/3 innings and struck out five. He allowed five hits and did not walk a batter.\n\nThe White Sox scored a run in the second inning after former Cardinal Paul DeJong lined a one-out double that hopped over the center field wall, advanced to third base on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly by White Sox rookie Bryan Ramos.\n\nLiberatore logged four of his five strikeouts after the White Sox scored, including three in the third inning. He retired the first two batters of the fourth inning on grounders to the infield, and then he exited after having thrown exactly 50 pitches.\n\nLeahy took the baton\n\nRight-handed reliever Kyle Leahy had allowed two runs on two hits in his only other outing of the season, 1 1/3 innings against the Detroit Tigers on April 30. For his major-league career, he'd appeared in just four games and allowed six runs in three innings for an ERA of 18.00.\n\nHowever, Leahy held the line in relief of Liberatore. Leahy turned in his best outing in the majors with 2 1/3 scoreless innings.\n\nLeahy did not allow a hit or a walk, and he struck out two batters.\n\nA former 17th-roudn draft pick in 2018, Leahy recorded his first strikeout in the fourth inning when he got DeJong to swing and miss at a sweeper to end the inning.\n\nIn the fifth, Leahy struck Martin Maldonado out on a sweeper to end a three-pitch at-bat.\n\nGallegos' struggles cost the Cardinals\n\nContreras' home run in the fourth inning tied the score 1-1, and it remained that way until the seventh inning when Gallegos entered the game for the Cardinals.\n\nA workhorse of the bullpen at one time (186 appearances from 2021-23), Gallegos entered the day with an ERA of 9.00 this season in 12 games. He'd allowed nine runs in nine hits and four of the 11 hits he allowed were home runs.\n\nWith all hands on deck for the bullpen game on Sunday and Gallegos' last outing having come in Detroit on April 30, there was no hiding the right-hander.\n\nGallegos got ahead of White Sox cleanup hitter Eloy Jimenez 0-2, but then threw a slider for a ball. He came back with a four-seam fastball on the next pitch, but the 91.3-mph pitch sailed in the upper third of the strike zone and over the outer half of the plate.\n\nJimenez mashed the pitch 411 feet for a solo home run to center field. That gave the White Sox the lead, and they did not relinquish the lead for the rest of the day.\n\nGavin Sheets followed with a double, and DeJong doubled to drive in Sheets and mark the end of Gallegos' outing. Gallegos faced the minimum of three batters, gave up three extra-base hits and all three batters scored in the inning.\n\nLeft-hander John King took mound after Gallegos, and he gave up a pair of singles, including a one-out RBI single by Braden Shewmake. DeJong scored on Shewmake's single to account for the third run charged to Gallegos. King gave up one run of his own in the inning on a sacrifice fly by Robbie Grossman.\n\nGrossman's sacrifice fly made the score 5-1.\n\n0 Comments Tags St Louis Cardinals Cardinals Baseball Matthew

They failed. Miserably.", "body": "Truth is, some games say more than others.\n\nSunday's 5-1 loss to the lousy White Sox at Busch Stadium just became a very good example in a very bad way.\n\nWhether you prefer to call it character, resolve, guts, gumption, grit or something else entirely, this was a game everybody knew would test whatever it is you like to call, \"it.\"\n\nThe Cardinals just failed the test in front of more than 43,000.\n\nFlunked it.\n\nBig, fat F.\n\nLike a ripe fastball in a hitter's count this team so often watches for a called strike, the Cardinals just let it happen.\n\nThose of us who expected more out of the Cardinals this season compared to the last-place disaster that was 2023 are left with little encouraging to say at the moment.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations. Should St. Louis taxpayers kick in? Pro-Palestinian protests block traffic outside Washington University Teen charged with breaking into more than 35 cars in St. Louis County Southwest Airlines considering changes to its quirky boarding, pick-your-own seating practices St. Louis County man charged with 1966 Chicago killing, stabbing woman 125 times Washington University students suspended after campus protest against war in Gaza Video shows high-speed crash into Gus' Pretzel Shop.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nSure, these Cardinals are different in multiple ways than those Cardinals. They pitch and defend better. Maybe they run the bases better, but before that can definitively be determined they would have to get on base. Finding a new way to be entirely underwhelming doesn't count for much. Especially when the losses keep coming. They're back in the National League Central's basement.\n\nLet's add some context to this series-loss-cementing defeat at home to the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad White Sox.\n\nThe White Sox had won only six games when they showed up at Busch Stadium for Friday's series opener. Only one of those wins had come on the road. On the Cardinals' home field, the White Sox doubled their season road win total and number of series won.\n\nThere are no acceptable excuses. You maybe make excuses for not sweeping the White Sox. There are no excuses for losing a home series to them.\n\nYes, the Cardinals had to shift to a bullpen game Sunday. But why was that, really? Because the front office's errant belief in Steven Matz somehow turning into a reliable starter once again blew up in the team's face, causing a preventable scramble.\n\nYes, the Cardinals lost Saturday's game after C.B. Bucknor, baseball's second-worst umpire behind Angel Hernandez, called a clear ball a game-ending strike against Ivan Herrera. And? If you leave the fate of your game in Bucknor's hands, especially after a 3-plus hour rain delay, chances are high you will not like what you get.\n\nBesides, it wasn't Bucknor who went 3-for-13 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10 in that Saturday loss.\n\nAnd it wasn't Bucknor who got one runner past second base Sunday.\n\nThis ghost of a Cardinals offense did.\n\nAnd it was ex-Cards outfielder Tommy Pham, not Bucknor, who hit Saturday's go-ahead run for the White Sox before that lengthy rain delay.\n\nPham wanted a Cardinals reunion this season, for those who had not heard. He even showed up at Cardinals spring training hoping to secure a job during his visit. The Cardinals were not interested in his services.\n\nWhile he's not one of three former Cardinals outfielders (Marcell Ozuna, Tyler O'Neill and Adolis Garcia) currently ranked in baseball's top-seven for home runs, Pham is averaging .286 with a .753 on-base plus slugging percentage through his first 35 at-bats with the White Sox despite a late start. That's a higher OPS than the .545 one Cardinals outfielders had entering Sunday's loss, and that was before they combined to go 2-for-10 with two infield singles in this game.\n\nPile upon used-up reliever Giovanny Gallegos for fumbling Sunday's bullpen-game baton if you like. He looks spent, or hurt. Time to find an impingement of some kind. The Cardinals used him and used him and now there may not be much left.\n\nBut let's not overlook the bigger issue here. Last season a sketchy rotation doomed the season. This season a silent offense is threatening to do the same.\n\nA lineup full of sagging hitters with just one steady exception in Willson Contreras, who provided Sunday's lone run via homer, showed up on a day the world knew offense was needed due to emergency pitching plans, then did next to nothing. Hitters who insist they love hitting coach Turner Ward keep pouring gas on fans' hollering to fire him, just to try something, anything.\n\nThat's the kind of loss Sunday felt like, one that can get someone fired. But when every piece of the puzzle has been put in place by a front office that exists behind a Teflon shield, plenty of fans also are wondering how players, coaches and managers keep changing, but never the front office.\n\nWard isn't the one up there tracking meatballs into the catcher's mitt, but the offense he's in charge of getting right is all sorts of wrong.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt looks lost. Nolan Arenado is slugging .395. Nolan Gorman, last season's home run leader, got pinch-hit for Saturday with a game on the line, and it could have been the right call, considering he's averaging .182.\n\nThe Cardinals are tied, ironically with the White Sox, for the fewest homers in baseball (23). Their .624 OPS is basically tied with the 9-26 Marlins for second-lowest in the game, ahead of only the White Sox (.597). They are in baseball's bottom-five in hard-hit percentage (36.6%) and barrel percentage (6.1%). According to Sports Info Solutions, the Cardinals see MLB's eighth-highest percentage of pitches inside the strike zone (43.1%) yet swing at the seventh-lowest percentage (66.6%) of those in-the-zone offerings. Compare that to, say, the clobbering Braves, who see 41% of pitches inside the zone and swing at 74.7% of those pitches.\n\nHow fun it must be to pitch against these Cardinals right now, like White Sox starter Garrett Crochet did for six innings Sunday. He handcuffed the Cardinals to one run in six innings, striking out six and walking none. He showed up here with a four-game losing streak and zero career road wins; he was 0-6 in his 40 previous road appearances.\n\nPounding the zone against the Cardinals is the way, because they don't like to swing, and when they do, they don't do much damage. Even when they come to the ballpark knowing their own pitching needs help. Even when everyone had to know a loss Sunday would be a different kind of bad.\n\nThis was a tell-you-something game, as big of a gut test you will find in May.\n\nThe Cardinals failed it.\n\n0

Some wonder where the franchise is going and manager Oli Marmol's recent comments shed light on the direction of the Cardinals' future.\n\n\"These are the players we're going to win with,\" Marmol told the media after Sunday's 5-1 loss to the White Sox, as transcribed by the Athletic's Katie Woo. \"We have to get them going.\"\n\nIn other words, do not expect St. Louis to be active in the early trade market or scouring the waiver wire for external additions to the lineup.\n\nThe biggest hindrance to the Cardinals' success this year has been the offense -- which has produced only 118 runs, the second-fewest scored by any team this season.\n\nThe front office did not predict the lineup to struggle this badly going into this past offseason and was more focused on retooling the pitching staff -- which has performed much better than it did in 2023.\n\nOnly Nolan Arenado and Wilson Contreras are hitting above a .700 OPS.

Hopefully, the returns of Dylan Carlson, Tommy Edman and Matt Carpenter will help the club turn things around.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_hagerty@si.com", "name": "Nate Hagerty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Donovan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Carlson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Carlson (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Edman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Carpenter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Carpenter (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7209,h_4055,x_0,y_589/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx7agj8v232ygkq7dp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540026", "eventUri": "eng-9540026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Left-hander Sean Manaea (1-1, 3.07) will try to help New York get back on track when he takes the mound on Monday.\n\nManaea allowed one run on three hits and four walks in five innings in his latest start, a no-decision against the Chicago Cubs last Tuesday.

No one expected this team to be an elite playoff contender this year. The lowest expectation for them was to not completely be bad. And yet, here they are. The White Sox are the worst team in the American League by a wide margin.\n\nAmid this one of a kind awful season, the White Sox are gearing up for the worst. It's still early in the season, but it seems like Chicago is ready to move on from this nightmare. Bob Nightengale reports that the White Sox are already looking to trade some of their stars in order to rebuild for the future.\n\n\"Outfielder Tommy Pham just joined the White Sox a week ago, but already is their best healthy player, and could be their leading candidate to represent the team at the All-Star Game. The White Sox, off to their worst start in franchise history, are still hoping to trade Pham to the highest bidder before the trade deadline.\"\n\n\"The White Sox are also expected to trade starters Erick Fedde, Chris Flexen, Mike Clevinger, reliever Michael Kopech and DH Eloy Jimenez.\"\n\nYep. That's how bad they've been this season. It hasn't been that long into the season yet, and the White Sox are already punting away the year. It's been rough. They had a slow to the season and they have never fully recovered from that. Now, they're better off just tossing the season and looking forward to 2025... or beyond.\n\nWhite Sox's brutal season\n\nThis season has been hell for the White Sox. At one point, they were completely shut out in all of their games. Both the stats and the eye test show that this team simply isn't cut out to play competitive ball this season. Their rotations keeps starting off flat, and the bats simply just can't do anything to save them from their misery.\n\nAs mentioned, Pham was one of the team's more recent signings. And yet, he's probably the best contributor to the team now this season. A .323 batting average while posting an OPS of .848 is just simply remarkable. However, Pham's talents are being wasted on this team. It makes sense to try and recoup some of his value somewhat by trading him to a better team.\n\nThe rest of the White Sox's rotation is bound to be traded, as well. This team is just honestly tragic when you watch them on the field. Mental errors from the fielders, pitchers struggling to get out of innings, it's just brutal to witness. This team doesn't need a reset, it needs to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch.\n\nSurely, it can't get much worse than this... right? They are currently on pace to completely annihilate the current record for worst record in a season. Surely, this has to be rock bottom for the team. At the very least, the team can hope that there's nowhere to go but up for this team. Because if this team somehow sinks deeper... the fanbase might just spontaneously combust.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gerard_angelo_samillano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Gerard Angelo Samillano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Clevinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Clevinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Fedde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erick Fedde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kopech", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Kopech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloy_Jim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eloy Jim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-Sox-expected-to-conduct-firesale-amid-horrid-start-to-2024-campaign.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540026", "eventUri": "eng-9540026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

However, with the recent injury of left-hander Steven Matz, the Cardinals are now faced with the reality that they might need more pitching depth.\n\nAfter Sunday's frustrating 5-1 loss to the White Sox in which St. Louis' bullpen pitched the whole game, the Cardinals might be making a call to the minors for help.\n\n\"(Chris) Roycroft, whose story includes playing college basketball, has an upper octave power fastball and he is in the mix for a promotion as the Cardinals consider moves for the bullpen after Sunday's by-committee game and ahead of the (New York Mets) series,\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch's Derrick Goold reported Monday afternoon.\n\nRoycroft has recorded a 1.38 ERA with a 9-to-6 strikeout-to-walk ratio, .213 batting average against and a 1.23 WHIP in 13 innings pitched across 11 games played for Triple-A Memphis this season.\n\nThe 26-year-old began his journey in St. Louis' farm system back in 2022 and quickly climbed his way up to Triple-A last summer.\n\nThe flamethrower is capable of throwing in the upper 90 mph range and could be another vital asset to the Cardinals' commanding bullpen -- that is if he can translate his minor-league success to the next level.\n\nAdding another hard-throwing pitcher to the staff will hopefully give the Cardinals more flexibility but more importantly in the short-term, replenish a bullpen that is full of players in need of a night or two off.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_hagerty@si.com", "name": "Nate Hagerty", "type": "author",

For Orin Swift founder and winemaker Dave Phinney, personal touches are at the helm of his brand. Orin Swift was founded in 1998 with the name inspired by Phinney\u2019s parents \u2014 his father\u2019s middle name, Orin, and his mother\u2019s maiden name, Swift. In 2014, Orin Swift opened its first tasting room in St. Helena, California. \u201cWe wanted to create space that truly reflects our design sensibilities and would also feel warm and inviting,\u201d Phinney told Forbes. \u201cWe took time to find unique items to complement the existing feel of the stunning space that we were working within,\u201d The tasting room was originally the Bank of Italy and, when redesigning the space, Phinney and his team wanted to keep as many of the historic Art Deco elements, including the columns on the exterior and the high ceilings and vault door on the interior. \u201cWe also retained the building\u2019s original fire door within the interior wall, which is a nod to the private space that exists on the other side, Scissors,\u201d With four unique tasting areas, Phinney used raw materials and specially curated pieces that bring each experience to life. The main room features the Rock standing bar with a luxurious marble countertop and a wine wall on a backdrop of deep Mahogany wood; the Paper seated area with Mid-Century Modern-esque furniture and minimalistic artwork; and the Vault private group tasting room, located in the bank vault and features hidden Easter Eggs nodding to the past structure. This includes an original bank note embedded in the ceiling.

Much of the artwork has been curated from Phinney's personal collection Orin Swift \u201cIt was very important to me that some, if not all, of the artwork and furniture had some personal connection, either to me or to the brand. Some of the artwork connects back directly to our wine, like the recreation of the Burnt Sacrifice label,\u201d he explained. For this piece, we incorporated four other carbonized leaves that we had collected during the wildfires in 2020. Many of the other photographs, as well as small sculptures, are actually from my own collection. Truth be told, I\u2019m a bit of an art hoarder!\u201d A neutral color palette can seen throughout the space, with plenty of earth tones adding depth to the room. Sleek blacks and warm browns add a luxurious element to the space, as do the plush leather fabric chairs and stone tiled floors. However, Phinney\u2019s favorite piece in the space is a bright pink neon sign commissioned by his friend and colleague, Samantha Smith. \u201c[The sign was] recreated from her book, Advice from John, which features photos she captured over a five-year period of writings in bar bathrooms. The neon sign hanging in the tasting room simply states, \u2018You had me at hell no!\u2019 \u201d Orin Swift Tasting Room is open daily from 10am to 5pm. Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website.

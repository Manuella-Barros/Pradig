Fipronil, often used to kill fleas or mites, is banned from being used on chickens in South Korea.\n\nEggs from another farm in Yangju, just north of Seoul, with 23,000 hens, were found to be contaminated with more than the permissible level of bifenthrin, a restricted-used pesticide, it said. Two other farms in Naju and Cheonan were also detected to have contained over the standard level of the pesticide in the process of checking eggs distributed in the market, raising the number of contaminated farms to six in total so far.\n\nIt was not immediately known how many eggs from the farms were released into the market.\n\nThe fiasco over the contaminated eggs broke at a time when the country is already suffering from rising egg prices due to a signification reduction in supply caused by the recent outbreak of avian influenza here and the subsequent massive culling of egg-laying chickens.\n\n\"As the head of the government ministry in charge of food safety, I offer an apology for the latest tainted eggs,\" Agriculture Minister Kim Yung-rok said in a press conference. \"We are taking swift and strong measures. All polluted eggs and egg products will be discarded.\"\n\nHe said sales of eggs that pass the government-led quarantine examination will be immediately resumed, adding the distribution will return to normal level by Friday.\n\nAgriculture Minister Kim Yung-rok speaks during a press conference held at the government complex in Sejong, central South Korea, on Aug. 16, 2017. During the conference, the minister apologized for eggs found to be tainted with insecticides. (Yonhap)\n\nSince Tuesday, the government has been carrying out inspections on 243 farms, which are responsible for about a quarter of the amount of eggs circulated in the country, after eggs from local farms were found to be contaminated by pesticides earlier this week.\n\nThe government plans to complete the nationwide inspection by Thursday. All farms had been banned from distributing eggs since Tuesday until they receive the government's inspection results.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's announcement, the country's major retailers partially resumed the sales of eggs believed to be free from pesticides. They had pulled all eggs off their shelves the previous day.\n\nAfter a part-government policy coordination meeting, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said contaminated eggs have not spread widely across the country.\n\n\"A little more pesticide tends to be used during the summer season due to mites living on hens,\" Lee said.\n\nThe local education offices in Seoul and the second-largest city of Busan issued temporary bans on the use of eggs in school meals.\n\n\"We sent out instructions asking schools to stop using eggs in school meals for the safety of students, as concerns grew in the wake of the detection of pesticides in eggs,\" an official with the education office in Seoul said.\n\nThe office plans to take additional measures after watching the results of a government inspection of eggs set for Thursday.\n\nThe education office in Busan also issued a similar instruction, saying schools should not serve eggs at meals at least until Thursday.

It also noted that 26 farms were polluted with bifenthrin, which is used on agricultural crops.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies both bifenthrin and fipronil as \"possible human carcinogens.\"\n\nThe government has so far inspected 876 out of the 1,239 registered farms across the country and imposed a temporary ban on the sale of eggs at local retailers and supermarkets to ensure eggs contaminated with the harmful insecticides do not reach consumers.\n\nThe ministry said it will discard all eggs produced from the 32 farms that have used harmful substances exceeding permissible levels.\n\nIn addition, eggs produced by 35 separate farms -- which were certified as \"eco-friendly\" and not allowed to use pesticides -- also tested positive for such restricted chemicals.\n\nAs of Thursday, 844 farms passed the government-led inspection and were allowed to resume supplying eggs. They are able to supply 86.4 percent of the estimated 43 million eggs consumed every day in South Korea.\n\nThe ministry added that the distribution of eggs will return to a normal level by Friday.\n\nBut eggs sold at the country's largest discount chain E-Mart were also found to be contaminated by bifenthrin, as were those at another major hypermarket chain Homeplus.\n\nE-Mart said the eggs supplied by tainted farms made up less than 5 percent of all eggs sold at its stores, adding that it has discarded all of the eggs in question.\n\nEggs have been in short supply in South Korea in recent months after the country was hit hard by two outbreaks of bird flu since November.\n\nSouth Korean quarantine officials have slaughtered more than 38 million poultry, including 25.2 million egg-laying hens, a move that has reduced the country's daily egg output by about 30 percent, according to government data.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

(Yonhap)\n\n\"As of 5 a.m. Wednesday, 241 out of 243 tested farms, including 47 farms with more than 200,000 chickens, passed safety inspections,\" the Agriculture Ministry said.\n\nWednesday's announcement bring the total number of farms with contaminated eggs to five nationwide.\n\nThe 241 farms that passed the inspections will be immediately permitted to sell eggs to the public. All eggs had been pulled from store shelves following the discovery of toxic chemicals. The 241 farms supply about one-fourth of all eggs sold in Korea.\n\nThe government will be conducting safety tests on all egg farms through to Thursday.\n\nAt a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon instructed the Agriculture Ministry and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to move swiftly on the issue.\n\n\"It is possible to follow the production and distribution process for all eggs in Korea, so this issue can be contained much more easily than previous problems such as avian flu,\" he said.\n\n\"I expect that this problem can be managed within a few days, and the Agriculture Ministry and Food Safety Ministry must explain the situation to the public in an easy, accurate and honest way.\"\n\nThe Food Safety Ministry announced Wednesday that it would be making changes to safety procedures for eggs to ensure the safety of consumers by licensing companies to screen and package eggs before they hit store shelves.\n\nThis additional step would mean that eggs would no longer go straight from farms to stores, but go through an additional screening process.\n\nRetailers are to cooperate with the relevant government agencies to immediately resume sales of eggs. The Agriculture Ministry said that it would be cooperating with large-scale retailers such as Emart and Nonghyup to keep egg prices and supplies stable during the inspection process.\n\nDespite these efforts, the government faced criticism due to its inability to prevent the crisis. Concerns about possibly contaminated eggs had been present since fipronil had been found in eggs in Europe, but the Food Safety Ministry had assured consumers that no contaminated eggs had been brought into Korea and that Korean eggs were safe.\n\nCompanies had responded before the government. One company, which uses 60 tons of eggs daily, said that it had run tests on its supplying farms earlier in August to ensure that there were no problems with its egg supplies.\n\nThe Consumers Union of Korea, a consumers' rights groups here, had also proposed strengthening safety procedures on eggs in April. When egg prices spiked in Korea due to an outbreak of avian flu, the government had responded by bringing in eggs from overseas -- which had sparked anxiety among consumers about the safety protocol surrounding these eggs.\n\nBy Won Ho-jung (hjwon@heraldcorp.com)", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "wgt": 100, "id": 213, "label":

They also noted that 26 farms were polluted with bifenthrin, which is used on agricultural crops.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies both bifenthrin and fipronil as \"possible human carcinogens.\"\n\nThe government has so far inspected 876 out of the 1,239 registered farms across the country and imposed a temporary ban on the sale of eggs at local retailers and supermarkets to ensure eggs contaminated with the harmful insecticides do not reach consumers.\n\nThe ministry said it will discard all eggs produced from the 32 farms that have used harmful substances exceeding permissible levels.\n\nIn addition, eggs produced by 35 separate farms -- which were certified as \"eco-friendly\" and not allowed to use pesticides -- also tested positive for such restricted chemicals.\n\nAs of Thursday, 844 farms passed the government-led inspection and were allowed to resume supplying eggs. They are able to supply 86.4 percent of the estimated 43 million eggs consumed every day in South Korea.\n\nThe ministry added that the distribution of eggs will return to a normal level by Friday.\n\nBut eggs sold at the country's largest discount chain E-Mart were also found to be contaminated by bifenthrin, as were those at another major hypermarket chain Homeplus.\n\nE-Mart said the eggs supplied by tainted farms made up less than 5 percent of all eggs sold at its stores, adding that it has discarded all of the eggs in question.\n\nEggs have been in short supply in South Korea in recent months after the country was hit hard by two outbreaks of bird flu since November.\n\nSouth Korean quarantine officials have slaughtered more than 38 million poultry, including 25.2 million egg-laying hens, a move that has reduced the country's daily egg output by about 30 percent, according to government data.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

One company, which uses 60 tons of eggs daily, said that it had run tests on its supplying farms earlier in August to ensure that there were no problems with its egg supplies.\n\nThe Consumers Union of Korea, a consumers' rights groups here, had also proposed strengthening safety procedures on eggs in April.\n\nWhen egg prices spiked in Korea due to an outbreak of bird flu, the government had responded by bringing in eggs from overseas -- which had sparked anxiety among consumers about the safety protocol surrounding these eggs.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yangju"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangju", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yangju"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65745"}, {"location": {"country": null, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65773"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302524", "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302854", "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303387", "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304837", "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304844", "label": {"eng": "Egg (food)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304848", "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304864", "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305304", "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307087", "label": {"eng": "Farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307135", "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307142", "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309754", "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311344", "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312912", "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321661", "label": {"eng": "Food safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327117", "label": {"eng": "Tick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330268", "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331768", "label": {"eng": "Dizziness"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gyeonggi Province"}, "type": "loc", "id": "342762"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "422815", "label": {"eng": "E-mart"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangwon_Province_(South_Korea)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gangwon Province (South Korea)"}, "type": "loc", "id": "432829"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Agricultural_Cooperative_Federation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "446251", "label": {"eng": "National Agricultural Cooperative Federation"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheorwon_County", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheorwon County"}, "type": "loc", "id": "452154"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeplus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "595256", "label": {"eng": "Homeplus"}}]}

There were only 50,000 eggs left when ministry officials visited the farm for further inspections after being informed of the test result.\n\n\"I used it at recommendation from a neighboring farm that it's good for destroying ticks. I didn't know it was fipronil,\" the farm owner told officials. He also stated that he doesn't remember exactly when he began using the fipronil, according to other sources.\n\nThe same pesticide has been found in eggs in 17 European countries since the health scandal broke out early this month.\n\nWith the government beginning to check egg farms, the nation's top three discount store chains said they have stopped selling eggs starting Tuesday.\n\nHomeplus, Lotte Mart and E-Mart said they decided to pull eggs off the shelf until results of the government's inspection into egg farms are released.\n\nHomeplus described its decision to stop selling eggs as a \"precautionary measure,\" saying it didn't purchase eggs from the Namyangju farm.\n\nConvenience stores also took eggs off the shelf to allay consumer concerns.\n\nCU, the nation's largest convenience store chain with some 10,000 outlets, said it has withdrawn eggs and egg food products.\n\n\"The decision takes into account people's safety and general anxiety,\" said a CU official.\n\nTwo other convenience store chains, GS25 and 7-Eleven, have halted sales of egg products.\n\nAgriculture Minister Kim Yung-rok held a meeting of heads of relevant government agencies to discuss measures to deal with the nation's first instance of pesticide-tainted eggs.\n\nDuring the gathering, the policymaker vowed to swiftly conduct an inspection of egg producers to minimize the impact on consumers.\n\nBy conducting a swift inspection of egg farms with more than 200,000 hens by Tuesday night, the minister said, what amounts to about 25 percent of the eggs that would normally reach the market on a daily basis can be sold on Wednesday.\n\nAlso, the government plans to complete an inspection into all egg farms within three days, he emphasized.", "date": "2017-08-15",

about food safety.\n\n\"The government is tracking all tainted eggs and will discard them,\" Agriculture Minister Kim Yung-rok said in a National Assembly session. \"We will publish all information on the quarantine inspections and measures online.\"\n\nHe also offered an apology for the latest food scare, which broke Tuesday when eggs from three local farms were first found to have been contaminated by pesticides.\n\nSome eggs from six farms were found to contain fipronil, a pesticide designed to control ants, cockroaches and other insects, while 26 farms were polluted with bifenthrin, which is used on agricultural crops, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies both bifenthrin and fipronil as \"possible human carcinogens.\"\n\nThe government has so far inspected 876 out of the 1,239 registered farms across the country and imposed a temporary ban on the sale of eggs at local retailers and supermarkets to ensure eggs contaminated with the harmful insecticides do not reach consumers.\n\nThe ministry said it will discard all eggs produced from the 32 farms that have used harmful substances exceeding permissible levels.\n\nIn addition, eggs produced by 35 separate farms -- which were certified as \"eco-friendly\" and not allowed to use pesticides -- also tested positive for such restricted chemicals.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government allowed the resumption of the sale of eggs that passed the government-led quarantine examination, adding the distribution will return to a normal level by Friday.\n\nBut eggs sold at the country's largest discount chain E-Mart were also found to be contaminated by bifenthrin, as were those at another major hypermarket chain Homeplus.\n\nE-Mart said the eggs supplied by tainted farms made up less than 5 percent of all eggs sold at its stores, adding that it has discarded all of the eggs in question.\n\nEggs have been in short supply in South Korea in recent months after the country was hit hard by two outbreaks of bird flu since November.\n\nSouth Korean quarantine officials have slaughtered more than 38 million

Fipronil is banned from being used for hens in Korea, and so there is no official standard set for this pesticide.\n\nWhy egg farms have used the banned substance is not clear, but that's probably because the number of insects have spiked amid the scorching heat waves this year. What is most embarrassing is that even government-approved \"organic\" farms used the harmful pesticide at a time when more than 70 percent of the nation's egg farms with more than 3,000 hens have won such approval.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Moon Jae-in ordered his prime minister to address the contaminated egg problem more actively. But the health scare might spiral out of control because more farms could be found to have used banned chemical substances through the nationwide inspection that will continue through today.\n\nWhile millions of eggs have been pulled from store shelves in Europe since early August, our relevant authorities have remained idle spectators, saying egg farms in Korea are safe from the pesticide problem.\n\nTurmoil in egg distribution is inevitable, given that many farms have stopped supplying eggs and retailers are still reluctant to sell them. The pesticide problem follows an egg shortage earlier this year after an avian influenza outbreak that pushed egg prices up sharply. Consumers still complain of the aftermath of the bird flu fear.\n\nWhat is most urgent is to closely trace the distribution channel of the contaminated eggs and destroy all of them. Only with swift fact-finding and follow-up measures will people's anxiety subside.\n\nOne cannot overemphasize the importance of food safety. The government should do its utmost to contain the latest egg scandal as quickly as possible.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry", "wgt": 100, "id": 388, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable_Agriculture", "wgt": 100, "id": 774, "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable Agriculture"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 100, "id": 1195, "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "wgt": 100, "id": 1212, "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yangju"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangju", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yangju"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65745"}, {"location": {"country": null, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65773"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302524", "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304496", "label": {"eng": "Insect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304837", "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305531", "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311344", "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316247", "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316248", "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318092", "label": {"eng": "Ant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318452", "label": {"eng": "Termite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "321661", "label": {"eng": "Food safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325228", "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327117", "label": {"eng": "Tick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330268", "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "333086", "label": {"eng": "Flea"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gyeonggi Province"}, "type": "loc", "id": "342762"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "355687", "label": {"eng": "Louse"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangwon_Province_(South_Korea)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gangwon Province (South Korea)"}, "type": "loc", "id": "432829"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Jae-in", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "448641", "label": {"eng": "Moon Jae-in"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheorwon_County", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheorwon County"}, "type": "loc", "id": "452154"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifenthrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "503531", "label": {"eng": "Bifenthrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}]}

Internet shopping sites including Coupang and Wemakeprice suspended sales of fresh and boiled eggs as well as food items with eggs, such as cookies.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs found that a farm located in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, had delivered eggs contaminated with fipronil. The farm reportedly produced 25,000 eggs per day.\n\nFipronil is a broad-spectrum insecticide used to treat lice, fleas and ticks. Ingestion of small doses has few effects and requires little medical treatment, but it can cause liver, kidney and thyroid gland damage if taken in large amounts over time, according to the World Health Organisation. The same pesticide has been found in eggs in 17 European countries.\n\nThe owners of the farm reportedly said in the inspection that they had used the substance upon hearing of its effectiveness in killing ticks and that they were not aware it was fipronil.\n\nAnother egg farm in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, was also found to have used above-recommended amounts of bfenthrin, an insecticide used against the red imported fire ant.\n\nThe owner of the farm reportedly said that they had used the insecticide to shoo away flies.\n\nAmid the public's growing concerns over possible contamination of eggs, the government released a sequence of measures throughout the day.\n\nThe Food Ministry immediately banned all shipments of eggs from local egg farms with at least 3,000 chickens. It also started to conduct inspections of local egg farms across the country.\n\n\"The ministry will put its utmost efforts to first finish inspections of the largest farms with over 200,000 hens in order to cope with the supply problem,\" Kim said.\n\n\"Starting Wednesday, local farms will be able to resume supplying 25 per cent of the normal supply level,\" he added.\n\nA ministry official said the nationwide inspections are expected to be completed by the end of the week. \"Starting with the largest egg farms, the ministry will inspect every local egg farm in the nation.\"\n\nThe Food Ministry will lift the shipment ban for farms that have no fipronil detected in their eggs upon inspection in order to cope with the supply problem.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is set to track the distribution channels of the contaminated eggs that the farm in Namyangju shipped out. It plans to recall and discard all such eggs upon locating them.\n\nThe egg industry enduring yet another crisis, following the spread of bird flu last winter and the mass perish of chickens from a recent heat wave.\n\nOther related industries such as bakeries and restaurants are expected to be dealt a blow as well. Egg prices are expected to soar as the supply remains unstable.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, has decided to hold preventive education sessions on insecticides for egg farms.\n\nThe Korea Poultry Association has put up on its website a schedule for sessions to be held in the Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces from Aug. 22.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

Some eggs in 17 other countries were also found to contain the pesticide.\n\nAccording to experts, fipronil has a very low risk of human intoxication, meaning that humans would have to consume eggs contaminated with a level of pesticide found in Belgium and the Netherlands throughout their entire lives to suffer its adverse effects.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 100, "id": 1195, "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "wgt": 100, "id": 1212, "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "loc", "id": "19"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Denmark"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Denmark"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc", "id": "67"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "171"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yanggok"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namyangju", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yanggok"}, "type": "loc", "id": "66990"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302524", "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304483", "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304837", "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304844", "label": {"eng": "Egg (food)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305531", "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312755", "label": {"eng": "Yonhap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322533", "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "422815", "label": {"eng": "E-mart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeplus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "595256", "label": {"eng": "Homeplus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Mart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "708333", "label": {"eng": "Lotte Mart"}}]}

egg products in South Korea have been contaminated with a potentially harmful pesticide, the government said Tuesday, amid a growing health scare in Europe over tainted egg products.\n\nSome eggs at a farm with 80,000 hens in Namyangju, east of Seoul, were found to contain the pesticide fipronil on Monday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said.\n\nThe ministry temporarily banned all egg farms from producing eggs from Tuesday so it can carry out an inspection.\n\nIt was not known how many samples tested positive for the pesticide, but the Namyangju farm had produced 25,000 eggs per day.\n\nThe same pesticide has been found in eggs in 17 European countries since the health scandal broke out early this month.\n\nWith the government beginning to check egg farms, the nation's top three discount store chains said they have stopped selling eggs starting Tuesday.\n\nHomeplus, Lotte Mart and E-Mart said they decided to pull eggs off the shelf until results of the government's inspection into egg farms are released.\n\nHomeplus described its decision to stop selling eggs as a \"precautionary measure,\" saying it didn't purchase eggs from the Namyangju farm.\n\nConvenience stores also took eggs off the shelf to allay consumer concerns.\n\nCU, the nation's largest convenience store chain with some 10,000 outlets, said it has withdrawn eggs and egg food products.\n\n\"The decision takes into account people's safety and general anxiety,\" said a CU official.\n\nTwo other convenience store chains, GS25 and 7-Eleven, have halted sales of egg products.\n\nAgriculture Minister Kim Yung-rok held a meeting of heads of relevant government agencies to discuss measures to deal with the nation's first instance of pesticide-tainted eggs.\n\nDuring the gathering, the policymaker vowed to swiftly conduct an inspection of egg producers to minimize the impact on consumers.\n\nBy conducting a swift inspection of egg farms with more than 200,000 hens by Tuesday night, the minister said, what amounts to about 25 percent of the eggs that would normally reach the market on a daily basis can be sold on Wednesday.\n\nAlso, the government plans to complete an inspection into all egg farms within three days, he emphasized.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 222, "label":

He also noted they have not been distributed widely yet.\n\n\"Pesticide is used during the summer season due to mites living on hens, but the amount is not much,\" he said.\n\nYet it may take a quite a while to rid consumers of their fears of contaminated eggs. Many people are now reluctant to eat eggs, while some are demanding a refund for those they bought before the news of the contamination broke.\n\nParents of small children are especially worried. Almost all education offices have issued temporary bans on the use of eggs in school meals.\n\n\"We sent out instructions ordering schools to stop using eggs in school meals for the safety of students, as concern grew in the wake of the detection of the pesticides in them,\" an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education said.\n\nThe office plans to take additional measures once the government reveals the final results of its inspection.\n\nThe education office in Busan also urged schools in the city not to use eggs for school meals until today.\n\n\"We will take this as an opportunity to strengthen safety checks on school meals,\" an official said.\n\nConsumers are also concerned that the incident will lead to hikes in egg prices.

They are also known to be harmful to humans.\n\nThe ministry said some eggs at a farm with 55,000 hens in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, were found to contain fipronil, which is banned from being used on poultry products here.\n\nEggs from another farm with 23,000 hens in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, were also found to be contaminated with levels of bifenthrin over the permissible level.\n\nSince the first case was found in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday, the ministry has carried out inspections on 243 out of 1,456 farms across the country.\n\nThe ministry said the farms confirmed to be safe will be allowed to resume selling and distributing eggs to the market Friday.\n\n\"As the head of the government ministry in charge of food safety, I offer an apology for the latest scandal,\" Minister Kim Yung-rok said. \"We are taking swift and strong measures. All contaminated eggs and egg products will be destroyed.\"\n\nThe decision came a day after the ministry banned all farms from transporting eggs Tuesday. The country's three largest discount store chains and convenience stores were also ordered to remove eggs from their shelves until notified by the ministry.\n\nThe ministry is accelerating inspections of the remaining farms -- results are expected to be made public Thursday.\n\nWith the growing health concern over eggs and egg products, President Moon Jae-in urged Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon to take charge of the crisis and use whatever means necessary to solve the problem.\n\n\"President Moon told the prime minister to comprehensively oversee the issue to reduce confusion, inform the public on the results of the ongoing inspection of all products and take all other necessary measures,\" Cheong Wa Dae said in a press release.\n\nEarlier, the prime minister ordered all contaminated eggs to be disposed of. He also noted they have not been distributed widely yet.\n\n\"Pesticide is used during the summer season due to mites living on hens, but the amount is not much,\" he said.\n\nYet it may take a long time to rid consumers of their fears of contaminated eggs. Many people are now reluctant to eat eggs, while others are demanding a refund for those they purchased before the scandal broke.\n\nParents of small children are especially worried. Following the scandal, almost all education offices have issued temporary bans on the use of eggs in school meals.\n\n\"We sent out instructions ordering schools to stop using eggs in school meals for the safety of students, as concern grew in the wake of the detection of the pesticides in them,\" an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education said.\n\nThe office plans to take additional measures once the government reveals the final results of its inspection.\n\nThe education office in Busan also urged schools in the city not to use eggs for school meals until today.\n\n\"We will take this as an opportunity to strengthen safety checks on school meals,\" an official said.\n\nConsumers are also concerned that the scandal will lead to hikes in egg prices. The minister said the government will try its best to stabilize prices.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "wgt": 100, "id": 1212, "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yangju"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangju", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yangju"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65745"}, {"location": {"country": null, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65773"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Busan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busan", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Busan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65791"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yanggok"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namyangju", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yanggok"}, "type": "loc", "id": "66990"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302524", "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304486", "label": {"eng": "Pest (organism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304496", "label": {"eng": "Insect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304837", "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304844", "label": {"eng": "Egg (food)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305880", "label": {"eng": "Head of government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309159", "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321661", "label": {"eng": "Food safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gyeonggi Province"}, "type": "loc", "id": "342762"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "419498", "label": {"eng": "Blue House"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangwon_Province_(South_Korea)", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gangwon Province (South Korea)"}, "type": "loc", "id": "432829"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Jae-in", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "448641", "label": {"eng": "Moon Jae-in"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheorwon_County", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheorwon County"}, "type": "loc", "id": "452154"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifenthrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "503531", "label": {"eng": "Bifenthrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Jeolla_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Jeolla Province"}, "type": "loc", "id": "561803"}]}

been found contaminated with harmful pesticides, authorities announced on Thursday.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it has detected fipronil-contaminated eggs in five farms, while eggs from 18 other farms have been found to contain bifenthrin and other pesticides, reports Efe news.\n\nThe latest detections raised the number of contaminated poultry facilities in the country to 31.\n\nFipronil is a pesticide used to control ants, cockroaches and other insects and is prohibited in poultry farms, while Bifenthrin is used in various agricultural corps.\n\nThe ministry has undertaken inspections on all 1,239 poultry farms registered in the country after detecting fipronil on Tuesday in several facilities.\n\nThe government has also temporarily prohibited the sale of eggs at major retailers and supermarkets across the country to keep consumers safe from contaminated products.\n\nSouth Korea has already restricted the sale of eggs produced in the country due to the 2016 outbreak of bird flu, forcing the Asian country to import eggs from countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands, Thailand and Spain.\n\nThere are currently no official reports on contaminated imported eggs in South Korea.\n\nIn early August, egg products from Belgium and Holland were reported to have been contaminated, while eggs from 17 other countries were also found to contain the substance.\n\nAccording to experts, the pesticide fipronil possesses a very low risk of human intoxication, meaning that human would have to consume eggs contaminated with a maximum level of pesticide found in Belgium and the Netherlands throughout their ives to suffer its adverse effects.\n\n--IANS\n\nksk\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-17",

The 1,190 qualified farms, which account for about 95.7 percent of all egg supply in Korea, will be permitted to immediately resume their sales. The given inspections were carried out from Tuesday to 9 a.m. on Friday.\n\nOf the 49 farms, 31 had been certified by the government as \"eco-friendly farms,\" meaning that no traces of any insecticide could have been found in the eggs. An additional 37 eco-friendly farms were found to be selling eggs with chemical traces but within official safety limits. These farms will be permitted to resume sales of their eggs without the eco-friendly mark.\n\n(Yonhap)\n\nThe government said it will immediately collect and dispose of eggs produced on the 49 farms, and run tests on products made with poultry from those farms as well.\n\nThe chemicals detected include fipronil, bifenthrin, flufenoxuron, etoxazole and pyridaben.\n\nFipronil is the same substance that caused an egg panic in Europe after being first discovered in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is a pesticide that is used to deflea dogs and cats, but is not permitted for use on poultry.\n\nAccording to a health risk assessment released by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety on Thursday, fipronil is a moderate toxin that usually shows mild and reversible health effects after acute risk.\n\nThe maximum number of eggs tainted with fipronil that can be consumed at once by an adult \"without exposure to acute risk\" is ten. For children between one to three years, it is just one egg.\n\nEggs that were found to contain excessive levels of bifenthrin included those distributed by large, trusted companies Homeplus and CJ CheilJedang.\n\nDespite the government's promises to improve its safety protocols for egg farmers, consumers remain wary -- not least because the two agencies tasked with handling the crisis seem unable to keep track of their data.\n\nSince Wednesday, the Agriculture Ministry and Food Safety Ministry have repeatedly released corrections to lists of farms that did not pass safety inspections.\n\nSome farms have also been discovered to have not been stamping their eggs with obligatory codes showing their origin, increasing consumer worries. The Food Safety Ministry has promised to overhaul its process for certifying farms as being pesticide-free, as well as the system for managing eggs sold to the public.\n\nFollowing criticisms from animal rights groups and the association of eco-friendly farmers, the government has also pledged to work toward improving conditions for chickens. Critics have noted that caging layer hens in cramped spaces increases the likelihood of the animals contracting red lice, leading to higher usage of pesticides on farms.\n\nThe government also plans to increase cooperation between various agencies to track food safety, for instance by \"building a cooperative body to create an information sharing system through the production and distribution processes of animal products,\" according to the Agriculture Ministry.\n\nRetailers have been moving quickly to quell consumer fears about purchasing potentially toxic eggs. The largest retailers simultaneously pulled all eggs from their shelves on Tuesday and began restocking only from farms that had been green-lighted by government agencies.\n\nMajor bakeries have also put out signs at their stores, assuring consumers about the safety of the eggs used in their products.\n\n\"The farms that supply our eggs have been both confirmed as being safe by the government, and we have also conducted our own internal tests,\" said an official with one food company. According to the official, sales of products that use large quantities of eggs have not been affected by the crisis so far.\n\nBy Won Ho-jung (hjwon@heraldcorp.com)", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "loc", "id": "19"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302524", "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303078", "label": {"eng": "Food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304830", "label": {"eng": "Animal product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304837", "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304848", "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304864", "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305531", "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308124", "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309159", "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309694", "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310440", "label": {"eng": "Farmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311344", "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312755", "label": {"eng": "Yonhap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "316946", "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317811", "label": {"eng": "Toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321661", "label": {"eng": "Food safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "355687", "label": {"eng": "Louse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_CheilJedang", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "451219", "label": {"eng": "CJ CheilJedang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifenthrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "503531", "label": {"eng": "Bifenthrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}]}

(Yonhap)\n\nThe government has been carrying out inspections on local farms since Tuesday after eggs produced from some local poultry facilities were found to be contaminated with pesticides earlier this week.\n\nThe ministry said 34 farms were detected with above the permissible level of bifenthrin, used on agricultural crops, while seven were found to have used fipronil. Two others farms were found with flufenoxuron, while the remaining two had etoxazole and pyridaben, according to the government.\n\nFipronil, flufenoxuron, etoxazole and pyridaben are banned from being used on chickens in South Korea as they could possibly harm human organs.\n\nOf the farms that have produced pesticide-tainted eggs, 28 were certified for producing \"eco-friendly\" eggs, which are strictly banned from using any pesticides at all.\n\nThe government has discarded all eggs produced from the polluted farms, while allowing the sales of eggs from farms that passed the inspection.\n\nDespite government's swift measures to quell public health concerns, the authorities have been criticized for failing to thoroughly carry out the inspection. The country's agriculture minister said Thursday that 121 farms are being re-examined after their samples were tested without meeting due procedures.\n\nThe government is scheduled to complete the inspections Friday and announce the final probe results later in the day.\n\nThe tainted-egg fiasco broke at a time when the country is already suffering from rising egg prices due to a signification reduction in supply caused by the recent outbreak of avian influenza here and the subsequent massive culling of egg-laying chickens.

The farm, which has some 80,000 hens, produces about 25,000 eggs a day.\n\nThe ministry has prohibited farms with more than 3,000 hens from producing eggs until the authorities complete a thorough inspection on the matter, Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nSouth Korea has already restricted the sale of eggs produced in the country due to the 2016 outbreak of bird flu, forcing the Asian country to import eggs from other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands, Thailand and Spain.\n\nAt the moment, there are still no official reports on imported eggs containing the pesticide in South Korea.\n\nFollowing the official announcement on Tuesday, three major South Korean retailers -- Homeplus, E-Mart and Lotte Mart -- announced they have suspended the sale of eggs until the government releases the results of their inspection.\n\nThe pesticide fipronil, a harmful substance banned for use in hens, has raised attention in Europe after Belgium and Holland were reported to have used the substance. Some eggs in 17 other countries were also found to contain the pesticide.\n\nAccording to experts, fipronil has a very low risk of human intoxication, meaning that humans would have to consume eggs contaminated with a level of pesticide found in Belgium and the Netherlands throughout their entire lives to suffer its adverse effects.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff

A bigger cause for concern is that the egg industry might not be the only one with such a problem.\n\nAs expected, the number of egg farms affected by the nationwide crisis is growing day by day, with more than 60 farms having been found to have produced eggs tainted by harmful pesticides.\n\nThe egg farms stretch from as north as Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, down to the southern city of Sunchang, North Jeolla Province. A government official said most of the farms were found to have used either bifenthrin or fipronil to remove mites from hens. Eggs from a farm in Sunchang had bifenthrin 21 times the permissible level.\n\nThe crisis is causing a food scare the like of which the nation has rarely seen. Eggs were removed from the shelves of major retail stores, egg farms had been slapped with a temporary comprehensive ban on shipments and schools and military units took eggs away from meals for students and soldiers.\n\nThe crisis, which comes on the heels of the avian flu epidemic that hit the chicken industry hard, is also heavily affecting other related industries like bakery and confectionary.\n\nAs President Moon Jae-in aptly gave instruction, the most urgent thing is to inspect all the farms across the country and eggs that had already been put on the market. This is not an easy task to do as there are a total of 1,239 egg farms in the country and numerous outlets selling eggs.\n\nAfter the inspections government officials said that they gave the go-ahead to about 241 farms for the supply of eggs, which accounts for about 25 percent of the total national supply.\n\nCertainly, the earlier the egg supply returns to normal, the better it will be for the people and industries. But the fact that officials found traces of pesticides in some eggs collected from retail shops show that, for now, authorities should focus on finding out sources of tainted eggs and keeping them away from consumers.\n\nAs with similar food scares, the crisis should be blamed on the government. The fact that a considerable number of farms that were found to have produced contaminated eggs had been government-certified as an \"environment-friendly\" farm is evidence of where the government's food management system stands.\n\nThe government had given the certificate to 780 or 73 percent of the 1,060 farms with at least 3,000 hens.\n\nMore disturbing is that there had already been warnings about pesticide contamination in eggs. In April this year, a university professor who questioned a sample group of egg farmers found that 61 percent of them were using pesticides to fight mites on hens.\n\nThe Consumers Union of Korea, a civic activist group, also found traces of pesticides in some eggs and asked authorities to conduct joint inspections. None at the Agriculture Ministry or the Food and Drug Safety Ministry bothered to pay heed to the request.\n\nIt was not until the news about the egg contamination cases in Europe hit the country when officials started to look into the possibility of similar cases.\n\nStill, the chief of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry was saying as late as last week that authorities had been monitoring the industry well and that local eggs were safe to eat.\n\nFarmers too cannot avoid blame as they -- seeking easier, bigger profits and/or ignoring the health hazards to egg consumers -- sprayed the toxic pesticides to hens. Some of them lacked a minimum level of knowledge about toxic materials they used.\n\nA farmer was quoted as saying that he used fipronil at the suggestion of his neighbor who praised its effects on killing mites. His veterinarian also told him it was all right.\n\nAlthough belated, Moon stepped in as the crisis escalated, ordering officials to conduct a sweeping examination of all egg farms across the country and review the government's food management system.\n\nIt also would be good if the egg crisis awakens government officials, producers and merchants to the need to overhaul the food safety system and upgrade professional ethics.

A bigger cause for concern is that the egg industry might not be the only one with such a problem.\n\nAs expected, the number of egg farms affected by the nationwide crisis is growing day by day, with more than 60 farms having been found to have produced eggs tainted by harmful pesticides.\n\nThe egg farms stretch from as north as Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, down to the southern city of Sunchang, North Jeolla Province. A government official said most of the farms were found to have used either bifenthrin or fipronil to remove mites from hens. Eggs from a farm in Sunchang had bifenthrin 21 times the permissible level.\n\nThe crisis is causing a food scare the like of which the nation has rarely seen. Eggs were removed from the shelves of major retail stores, egg farms had been slapped with a temporary comprehensive ban on shipments and schools and military units took eggs away from meals for students and soldiers.\n\nThe crisis, which comes on the heels of the avian flu epidemic that hit the chicken industry hard, is also heavily affecting other related industries like bakery and confectionary.\n\nAs President Moon Jae-in aptly gave instruction, the most urgent thing is to inspect all the farms across the country and eggs that had already been put on the market. This is not an easy task to do as there are a total of 1,239 egg farms in the country and numerous outlets selling eggs.\n\nAfter the inspections government officials said that they gave the go-ahead to about 241 farms for the supply of eggs, which accounts for about 25 percent of the total national supply.\n\nCertainly, the earlier the egg supply returns to normal, the better it will be for the people and industries. But the fact that officials found traces of pesticides in some eggs collected from retail shops show that, for now, authorities should focus on finding out sources of tainted eggs and keeping them away from consumers.\n\nAs with similar food scares, the crisis should be blamed on the government. The fact that a considerable number of farms that were found to have produced contaminated eggs had been government-certified as an \"environment-friendly\" farm is evidence of where the government's food management system stands.\n\nThe government had given the certificate to 780 or 73 percent of the 1,060 farms with at least 3,000 hens.\n\nMore disturbing is that there had already been warnings about pesticide contamination in eggs. In April this year, a university professor who questioned a sample group of egg farmers found that 61 percent of them were using pesticides to fight mites on hens.\n\nThe Consumers Union of Korea, a civic activist group, also found traces of pesticides in some eggs and asked authorities to conduct joint inspections. None at the Agriculture Ministry or the Food and Drug Safety Ministry bothered to pay heed to the request.\n\nIt was not until the news about the egg contamination cases in Europe hit the country when officials started to look into the possibility of similar cases.\n\nStill, the chief of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry was saying as late as last week that authorities had been monitoring the industry well and that local eggs were safe to eat.\n\nFarmers too cannot avoid blame as they -- seeking easier, bigger profits and/or ignoring the health hazards to egg consumers -- sprayed the toxic pesticides to hens. Some of them lacked a minimum level of knowledge about toxic materials they used.\n\nA farmer was quoted as saying that he used fipronil at the suggestion of his neighbor who praised its effects on killing mites. His veterinarian also told him it was all right.\n\nAlthough belated, Moon stepped in as the crisis escalated, ordering officials to conduct a sweeping examination of all egg farms across the country and review the government's food management system.\n\nIt also would be good if the egg crisis awakens government officials, producers and merchants to the need to overhaul the food safety system and upgrade professional ethics.

harmful pesticides, authorities announced on Thursday.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it has detected fipronil-contaminated eggs in five farms, while eggs from 18 other farms have been found to contain bifenthrin and other pesticides, reports Efe news.\n\nThe latest detections raised the number of contaminated poultry facilities in the country to 31.\n\nFipronil is a pesticide used to control ants, cockroaches and other insects and is prohibited in poultry farms, while Bifenthrin is used in various agricultural corps.\n\nThe ministry has undertaken inspections on all 1,239 poultry farms registered in the country after detecting fipronil on Tuesday in several facilities.\n\nThe government has also temporarily prohibited the sale of eggs at major retailers and supermarkets across the country to keep consumers safe from contaminated products.\n\nSouth Korea has already restricted the sale of eggs produced in the country due to the 2016 outbreak of bird flu, forcing the Asian country to import eggs from countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands, Thailand and Spain.\n\nThere are currently no official reports on contaminated imported eggs in South Korea.\n\nIn early August, egg products from Belgium and Holland were reported to have been contaminated, while eggs from 17 other countries were also found to contain the substance.\n\nAccording to experts, the pesticide fipronil possesses a very low risk of human intoxication, meaning that human would have to consume eggs contaminated with a maximum level of pesticide found in Belgium and the Netherlands throughout their ives to suffer its adverse effects.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Many farmers said using the substance was inevitable due to the summer heat wave when the number of insects spiked, ending up infecting or even killing their livestock. Using it is also a much cheaper way than building a better environment in which animals are raised, they said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), fipronil is considered \"moderately hazardous\" when consumed in large quantities, but it can be dangerous to the kidneys, liver and thyroid gland.\n\nMajor retailers, including Home plus, Lotte Mart, E-Mart and Nonghyup Hanaro, said they decided to suspend the sales of eggs pending the results of an ongoing government inspection into poultry farms.\n\nThe measure came hours after the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs began its inspection midnight of farms that have over 8,000 hens for the use of fipronil.\n\nThe ministry initiated its inspection shortly after a farm that had 80,000 hens in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, was found to contain the pesticide Monday.\n\nThe same day, another farm that had 60,000 hens in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, was found to have a mite which had over the maximum allowable level of bifenthrin, an insecticide used primarily against some types of ants by influencing their nervous system.\n\nThe ministry said it is unclear how many eggs are contaminated, adding that it is conducting a three-day inspection until Thursday of farms that have over 3,000 hens to identify ones that have used the banned insecticide or excessive amounts of permissible ones.\n\nAs of last December, the ministry said out of 1,060 farms that have over 3,000 hens, about 780, or 73 percent, are government-approved organic farms. Up to 90 percent of eggs are believed to come from such farms.\n\nThe Namyangju farm produced 25,000 eggs per day, and it sold to five buyers that sold them to retailers.\n\nToxicologist Kim Sun-cheun said the amount detected was not enough to cause an unnecessary scare according to the Codex Alimentarius, an international listing for standards on food and food production, recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization.\n\nFollowing the codex is not compulsory in Korea.\n\n\"The amount found was 0.0363mg/kg, which exceeded 0.02mg/kg. However, it takes at least 0.6 mg to affect a healthy adult. I think the government needs to promptly set up regulations now and I think the public should not worry too much,\" Kim said.\n\nThe same pesticide has been found in eggs in 17 European countries since the health scare broke out earlier this month.\n\nHome plus said it decided to stop selling eggs as a \"precautionary measure.\" CU, the nation's largest convenience store chain with 10,000 outlets, as well as GS25 and 7-Eleven, said they have withdrawn eggs and egg food products from their shelves.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics",

The total number of farms embroiled in the tainted-egg scandal rose to 45, according to the ministry.\n\nThe government has been carrying out inspections on local farms since Tuesday after eggs produced from some local poultry facilities were found to be contaminated with pesticides earlier this week.\n\nThe ministry said 34 farms were detected with above the permissible level of bifenthrin, used on agricultural crops, while seven were found to have used fipronil. Two others farms were found with flufenoxuron, while the remaining two had etoxazole and pyridaben, according to the government.\n\nFipronil, flufenoxuron, etoxazole and pyridaben are banned from being used on chickens in South Korea as they could possibly harm human organs.\n\nOf the farms that have produced pesticide-tainted eggs, 28 were certified for producing \"eco-friendly\" eggs, which are strictly banned from using any pesticides at all.\n\nThe government has discarded all eggs produced from the polluted farms, while allowing the sales of eggs from farms that passed the inspection.\n\nDespite government's swift measures to quell public health concerns, the authorities have been criticized for failing to thoroughly carry out the inspection.

Ironically, many of the EU's 500 million consumers are caught in a dilemma: to consume, or not to consume eggs.\n\nWith eggs containing the banned insecticide residue fipronil being found in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and other EU countries, I too am hesitant to eat eggs. Recently, when I ordered a bowl of udon noodles in a small Japanese restaurant beside the EU headquarters and saw the dish was covered with egg, my first reaction was refusal, although I managed to swallow it finally. Both psychologically and physically, however, I felt uncomfortable for hours after that.\n\nThat prompted me to investigate how eggs are sold in Brussels. In one 24-hour grocery just opposite the European Council office, the owner said his shop only sells one brand of eggs and he could guarantee they are safe. In a convenience shop beside the EU headquarters, however, the salesman, pointing at packs of eggs, warned me that I better not buy that brand (of a Belgian company) but the rest was fine.\n\nTo my surprise, I found some of \"bad\" eggs are still being sold in Brussels, although millions of them have been recalled. Which means, if you don't inquire properly, the \"bad\" eggs could land on your table. It is still not clear how those processed food that contain eggs are being made after the detection of fipronil in eggs.\n\nThe egg scandal has widened since July, with the European Commission saying contaminated eggs had been found in 15 EU countries till last week. They have also appeared in Switzerland, a non-EU country, and China's Hong Kong, signaling the spread of the egg scandal outside Europe. Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety found two samples of imported Dutch eggs contained fipronil and ordered the total recall of the two batches.\n\nThe Netherlands is the biggest egg producer in Europe as well as one of the largest egg exporters in the world. The egg scandal hit the headlines in July. Some reports, however, claim Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June but preferred not to inform the public about it.\n\nNow, of course 180 poultry farms in the Netherlands, which together used to supply millions of eggs per week, have been temporally closed. And a criminal investigation has been launched, centering on two firms\uff0dPoultry Vision, a Belgium-based pest control company, which reportedly sold the treatment to a Dutch poultry farm cleaning company, Chickfriend.\n\nEuropean experts, however, have played down the dangers of eating eggs with fipronil, which, despite being banned by the food regulator, was used in poultry farms to combat lice. Some say the eggs would harm humans only if they eat them every day throughout their lives.\n\nEven though the egg scandal is spreading and the EU is known for its strict food safety regulations, the European Union, whose officials are now on holiday shift, has no plans to hold an urgent meeting before the end of September, when EU agricultural ministers are scheduled to meet.\n\nThe egg scandal is a serious food scare that needs immediate action. To begin with, the EU should ban fipronil, take strict measures to ensure contaminated eggs do not enter the market, and hold those responsible for the scandal accountable. It should also timely inform the public about the egg scandal.\n\nMany farms in Europe have suffered from the EU's sanctions against Russia, which have reduced their exports of agricultural products in recent years, perhaps forcing them to cut corners to make up for the lost revenues and profits.\n\nBut we hope the affected poultry farms emerge stronger from the egg scandal and take stricter measures to ensure that the eggs on our dining tables are absolutely safe.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label":

Around 85 per cent of boxed eggs sold in the UK carry the logo.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency has said the risk to human health is very low as a result of the scandal.\n\nForensic scientists estimate that someone would need to eat 20,000 eggs in one sitting to become ill from fipronil poisoning.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "wgt": 100, "id": 39, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "wgt": 100, "id": 213, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 214, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Additives", "wgt": 100, "id": 216, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Additives"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Weblogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 647, "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Weblogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining_Guides", "wgt": 100, "id": 1067, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining Guides"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "wgt": 100, "id": 1606, "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302506", "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302569", "label": {"eng": "Restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303078", "label": {"eng": "Food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303650", "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303703", "label": {"eng": "Salad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304844", "label": {"eng": "Egg (food)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305347", "label": {"eng": "Cooking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313993", "label": {"eng": "Sandwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "314007", "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "320297", "label": {"eng": "Convenience food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "347800", "label": {"eng": "Salmonella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "354119", "label": {"eng": "Food Standards Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}]}

It also decided to increase the basic pension for senior citizens to 250,000 won a month from next April.

The inspection is ongoing at 363 other farms nationwide.\n\nOf the 876 inspected farms, 683, or 78 percent, were \"organic\" farms, which according to safety standards should sell eggs free of any harmful substance including insecticides.\n\nEggs from such farms cost up to twice the price of those that come from 193 \"non-organic\" farms, which are allowed to sell eggs after they pass safety tests for 27 harmful substances.\n\nOf the organic farms, almost 10 percent, or 62, were found to have eggs contaminated with the insecticides.

to the small Belgian town of Malmedy on Tuesday to eat a giant omelette made of 6,500 eggs, despite the country being at the centre of a scandal involving tainted eggs.\n\nBelgium became the first country last month to officially notify the EU's food safety alert system of the presence of eggs contaminated by the insecticide fipronil, followed by the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nThe insecticide, which can harm human health, has since been discovered in eggs in 14 other European countries since the scandal came to light on August 1 and has even been found as far afield as Hong Kong.\n\nIt has forced millions of eggs to be removed from supermarket shelves and the closure of more than 150 farms in the Netherlands.\n\n\"We were hit full-on by the tainted eggs scare,\" Rene Bourguignon said as he waited to prepare the omelette.\n\nWhile at least 1,000 people braved rainy skies to get a bite, the turnout was far below last year's record 7,000.\n\nThe local branch of the World Giant Omelette Brotherhood has been organising the festival in Malmedy for more than 20 years.\n\nIt spent a week preparing for this year's culinary opus, collecting 6,500 eggs from carefully selected places instead of the usual 10,000.\n\n\"We have total confidence in our local products, our suppliers are local and they fulfilled every health guarantee we asked of them since the beginning,\" Bourguignon said.\n\nThe number of attendees was a good sign, the Brotherhood's \"grand master,\" Jean-Pierre Gilles said.\n\n\"Of course, the public may have had its doubts and we did fear that a little, but seeing the numbers of people we saw today, I think it all went very well,\" Gilles said.\n\n\"Any doubts were swept away by friendship and warmth.\"\n\nMade simply with eggs, bacon, oil and chives, and cooked over a wood fire, the omelette has been a fixture of the annual festival since the 1990s when Belgium was hit with a similar scandal -- over chicken and eggs contaminated with dioxin, a known carcinogen.\n\nTraces of fipronil found in the contaminated eggs are at very low levels.\n\n\"The media said you needed to eat eight eggs a day\" for the insecticide to affect your health, local volunteer Gabiche Chleck said.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 117, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events"}, {"uri":

The agency didn't name any of the companies.\n\nIt said Thursday the two Danish companies planned to sell the eggs and omelet on to canteens, cafes and catering companies but that \"Fipronil is illegal in food and the products are therefore withdrawn.\"\n\nSo far, nine companies in Denmark have reported finding Fipronil-tainted eggs, the first one on Aug. 10.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "wgt": 100, "id": 39, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 222, "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Meat_and_Seafood", "wgt": 100, "id": 439, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Meat and Seafood"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 100, "id": 1195, "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "wgt": 100, "id": 1212, "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "wgt": 100, "id": 1606, "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "loc", "id": "19"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Denmark"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Denmark"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc", "id": "74"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Denmark"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "81535"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302504", "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302524", "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303650", "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304094", "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304496", "label": {"eng": "Insect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304837", "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304844", "label": {"eng": "Egg (food)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305299", "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309159", "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "311282", "label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omelette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "346069", "label": {"eng": "Omelette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFED", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "356249", "label": {"eng": "WFED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Schleswig-Holstein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "673215", "label": {"eng": "History of Schleswig-Holstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsored_Content_(South_Park)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1283290", "label": {"eng": "Sponsored Content (South Park)"}}]}

"About a thousand people flocked to the small Belgian town of Malmedy on Tuesday to eat a giant omelette made of 6,500 eggs, despite the country being at the center of a scandal involving tainted eggs.\n\nBelgium became the first country last month to officially notify the EU's food safety alert system of the presence of eggs contaminated by the insecticide fipronil, followed by the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nThe insecticide, which can harm human health, has since been discovered in eggs in 14 other European countries since the scandal came to light on August 1 and has even been found as far afield as Hong Kong.\n\nIt has forced millions of eggs to be removed from supermarket shelves and the closure of more than 150 farms in the Netherlands.\n\n\"We were hit full-on by the tainted eggs scare,\" Rene Bourguignon said as he waited to prepare the omelette.\n\nWhile at least 1,000 people braved rainy skies to get a bite, the turnout was far below last year's record 7,000.\n\nThe local branch of the World Giant Omelette Brotherhood has been organizing the festival in Malmedy for more than 20 years.\n\nIt spent a week preparing for this year's culinary opus, collecting 6,500 eggs from carefully selected places instead of the usual 10,000.\n\n\"We have total confidence in our local products, our suppliers are local and they fulfilled every health guarantee we asked of them since the beginning,\" Bourguignon said.\n\nThe number of attendees was a good sign, the Brotherhood's \"grand master,\" Jean-Pierre Gilles said.\n\n\"Of course, the public may have had its doubts and we did fear that a little, but seeing the numbers of people we saw today, I think it all went very well,\" Gilles said.\n\n\"Any doubts were swept away by friendship and warmth.\"\n\nMade simply with eggs, bacon, oil and chives, and cooked over a wood fire, the omelette has been a fixture of the annual festival since the 1990s when Belgium was hit with a similar scandal -- over chicken and eggs contaminated with dioxin, a known carcinogen.\n\nTraces of fipronil found in the contaminated eggs are at very low levels.\n\n\"The media said you needed to eat eight eggs a day\" for the insecticide to affect your health, local volunteer Gabiche Chleck said.\n\n\"Personally, there's no way I could eat all that.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

The 35 other organic farms found with moderate pesticide residues will lose organic certification and could go on selling eggs at cheaper price under non-organic category.\n\nOrganic eggs are more expensive than common eggs because they should be bred free-range, or cage free that requires less pesticide use, and healthier diet without use of antibiotics.\n\nFarms that passed the inspection will increase yield in order to help keep up the supply disrupted from the sale ban and recall.\n\nThe nationwide probe was triggered after an egg scare spread in Europe from discovery of fipronil, a type of pesticide, in a farm in Belgium that sparked mass-scale egg recall across Europe recently.

The FSA stressed at that stage that it was \"very unlikely\" the eggs posed a risk to public health.\n\nFood Standards Scotland said it is continuing to liaise with the FSA over the ongoing investigation into foods which may contain egg from farms in the Netherlands which used Fipronil to treat egg-laying hens.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, FSS said: \"Fipronil in the low doses we are seeing in affected eggs poses no risk to health, but it shouldn't be there as it's not authorised for use in food-producing animals.\n\n\"This investigation has now found that a small amount of liquid eggs from implicated farms was received by food businesses in Scotland who took immediate action to remove the products from sale.\"\n\nMost of the egg products identified were imported in a liquid or powdered form so it is not possible to state how many eggs are involved, FSS said.\n\nThe watchdog added: \"It remains the case that it is very unlikely there is any risk to public health from eating these foods, and the decision to withdraw these products is not due to food safety.\n\n\"There is no evidence that eggs laid in the UK are contaminated, so there is no need for people in Scotland to stop buying or eating whole eggs from shops.\n\n\"Testing of eggs on farms continues in Scotland and results to date have been negative.\"\n\nThe current situation is believed to have been caused by the illegal use of the chemical on farms in the Netherlands to combat parasites in chickens, FSS said.\n\nIt emphasised the number of eggs involved represents a fraction of a single

(Nati Shohat/Flash90)\n\nA massive European egg contamination has Israel's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development hatching a plan to ensure that the country has enough local eggs for the upcoming Jewish holidays, traditionally a period of high egg consumption.\n\nMillions of eggs in Europe have been contaminated with the pesticide fipronil, which reached at least 15 European Union countries and as far afield as Hong Kong. The pesticide is used for treatment of mites and other insects but is illegal to use on any animals in the human food chain. Ingesting large quantities of the pesticide can lead to damage of the liver, kidney, or thyroid gland.\n\nThe poultry industry in Israel is controlled by a quota system, where farmers can only produce a certain amount of eggs to avoid deflating prices. During holiday periods, when Israeli egg consumption has a spike, the ministry sometimes imports eggs to meet local needs while keeping egg production stable.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Agriculture Ministry announced, in light of the European contamination crisis, that it would reexamine the local quotas and announce new ones in 10 days.\n\nAgriculture Ministry director Shlomo Ben Eliyahu pledged that \"the country will not lack for even a single egg\" over the holiday period.\n\nAn ultra Orthodox man carries eggs in Jerusalem on April 5, 2009. (Matanya Tausig/Flash90)\n\nIn July, before news of the contamination broke, the ministry announced it would allow the importation of 30 million eggs during the fall holiday season, which includes the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah and Sukkot. They expected to import eggs from Italy, Spain, and Portugal. During the Passover holidays earlier this year, the ministry allowed for the importation of 100 million eggs.\n\nThe move angered Israel's 3,000 poultry growers, who accused the ministry of allowing too many eggs into the country and poaching their profits.\n\n\"It's not clear to us why the Agriculture Ministry, which is supposed to be responsible for strengthening Israeli agriculture, chooses to turn Israel into a recipient of Europe's surplus eggs,\" said Chicken Growers Association secretary Motti Elkabetz.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri":

discovered in eggs in 14 other European countries since the scandal came to light on August 1 and has even been found as far afield as Hong Kong.\n\nIt has forced millions of eggs to be removed from supermarket shelves and the closure of more than 150 farms in the Netherlands.\n\n\"We were hit full-on by the tainted eggs scare,\" Rene Bourguignon said as he waited to prepare the omelette.\n\nWhile at least 1,000 people braved rainy skies to get a bite, the turnout was far below last year's record 7,000.\n\nThe local branch of the World Giant Omelette Brotherhood has been organising the festival in Malmedy for more than 20 years.\n\nIt spent a week preparing for this year's culinary opus, collecting 6,500 eggs from carefully selected places instead of the usual 10,000.\n\n\"We have total confidence in our local products, our suppliers are local and they fulfilled every health guarantee we asked of them since the beginning,\" Bourguignon said.\n\nThe number of attendees was a good sign, the Brotherhood's \"grand master,\" Jean-Pierre Gilles said.\n\n\"Of course, the public may have had its doubts and we did fear that a little, but seeing the numbers of people we saw today, I think it all went very well,\" Gilles said.\n\n\"Any doubts were swept away by friendship and warmth.\"\n\nMade simply with eggs, bacon, oil and chives, and cooked over a wood fire, the omelette has been a fixture of the annual festival since the 1990s when Belgium was hit with a similar scandal -- over chicken and eggs contaminated with dioxin, a known carcinogen.\n\nTraces of fipronil found in the contaminated eggs are at very low levels.\n\n\"The media said you needed to eat eight eggs a day\" for the insecticide to affect your health, local volunteer Gabiche Chleck said.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 117, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events"}, {"uri":

Akpa, DG, Poultry Association of Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria today, we live in precarious times. The mind could easily discern that the fear in the atmosphere is as thick as a stormy cloud. The mood of the nation is so charged that any little spark ignites an inferno. And this happens in every aspect of our national life.\n\nWhen a mob lynches innocent people without as much as a preliminary enquiry, they might have been gripped by the spirit of the time. When neighbours suddenly become enemies because of issues emanating from the \"restructuring debate\", it is all about fear.\n\nWhen farmers refuse to sell their yam believing that government exportation of the crop will affect their lifestyle, this could as well be driven by fear. And when the government refuses to efficiently communicate to its people, whom it swore to serve, they might also be very afraid.\n\nIn fact, even religious people in Nigeria today pray in fear. Every word we utter, on the social media, in the church, on the street, is heavy with the malodorous load of putrid fear. And, now we want to import the fear of eggs all the way from Europe into Nigeria!\n\nA couple of days ago, a news item surfaced on some mainstream media suggesting that some of the insecticide-contaminated eggs which are presently pulled off the shelves in Europe, might have entered Nigeria. In every practical sense, the report has all the potential of going viral as a piece of scare-mongering social media prop, despite also having questionable attribution.\n\nTo start with, the writer, while reporting that there \"are fears that the contaminated eggs may have entered Nigeria,\" quoted just a \"source\", without even as much as specifying the institution where the source speaks from. According to the report, the source revealed \"that no collaboration had been established with the Ministry of Health to deal with the situation\". It also said that efforts to speak with the Nigeria Customs Service' Public Relations Officer \"yielded no result as his phone was switched off.\"\n\nIt then quoted the \"the official\" as saying, \"No official discussion about the insecticide has been held but there are fears that it has entered Nigeria or some African countries. It's most likely since more than half of the chickens and eggs we consume especially in Nigerian cities come from (the) EU market.\"\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, there is contamination of eggs by the insecticide fipronic, confirmed in about 17 European countries and Hong Kong. They are Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Denmark. Thousands of eggs have been removed from the market in Europe for fear they are also contaminated by the insecticide which were supplied by some unscrupulous agro-products dealers. Tests have already been carried out on chicken to determine whether the insecticide would have also contaminated the meat from chicken; but there is no official finding yet as to the likelihood of affecting meat.\n\nThis is why it is ridiculous and actually mischievous that the only \"true\" source of the corroboration for the submission that \"fipronil might have entered Nigeria\" is the story where Johan Bosch, the General Secretary of Belgium's National Association of Egg Traders, was quoted as saying that the farmers in Belgium had sent samples of their chicken to the authorities for testing.\n\nHe also said, \"Meat from egg-laying hens is sold all over the world but our first export market is Africa.\"\n\nIt is clear that the Belgian farmer did not say that they export eggs to Nigeria. He was talking about meat from egg-laying hens. It would therefore be bad journalism to copy and paste the piece of information as the only justification for the suggestion that Nigeria is now threatened by contaminated imported eggs.\n\nNigerians need to know the facts, and know it fast, before the misinformation is taken into an auto-pilot viral status. The first fact is that we do not import eggs. This information was personally given to me by someone who I believe should know, the Director General of the Poultry Association of Nigeria, Mr Onallo S. Akpa, whom I immediately contacted when I read the sad scare-mongering reports.\n\n\"There are no table egg imports from any part of the world to Nigeria. Even hatching eggs are in the last few years not being imported into the country, so there is no cause for alarm for any contaminated eggs coming into Nigeria,\" he said.\n\n\"At the moment Nigeria is the number one egg-producing nation in Africa with some of the invisible export to Niger Republic. Nigerian eggs used to be informally exported to Chad and Central African Republic, but the trade would have thrived if not for the insecurity in the North-East of the country.\"\n\nThe other fact is that we produce so many eggs that we have a glut during some periods of the year. So, what our country needs now is government support to farmers to diversify into the processing of eggs to create more added value, so as to create employment, and enable us control the regional African market and beyond.\n\nWhen the school feeding programme of Buhari's government first took off, I was one of the people that wanted to know how it would integrate local farmers by giving them a ready market for their farm produce. Today, it is gladdening to find out that the programme, which has already taken off in fourteen states is incorporating egg farmers. It is very important to mop up raw materials like egg from the farms, and enhance the nutrition of the pupils. Actually, most of them would not have had the privilege of eating an egg a day if they were fed by their parents.\n\nIt is funny, but a reality, that in some poor communities egg is rarely fed to children, who actually need it even more than adults. In these neighbourhoods, poverty has so weaved a culture of denial that children who have a taste for egg are generally labelled as having a tendency towards delinquency and crime. But the truth is that eggs are ideal for inclusion in children's diets as they are nutrient dense and provide useful amounts of folate, vitamin A, iron, iodine, zinc and omega-3s. They are also a good source of protein for children to support growth.\n\nOne can just imagine how such poor parents that cannot afford eggs for their children and wards would react to a contaminated egg tale. The yarn could evolve into a legend, and from legend to taboo, within a matter of months.\n\nImportantly, everything points to the truth that we need to consciously imbibe the culture of data and research-based development. This will enable seamless flow of governance as political leaders will always find recourse in established and trusted facts on ground, when they grab the helm. I say this because the other I overheard the minister of agriculture say that we import five million eggs daily from South Africa. One wonders, is he an egg importer, or is he also pushed by our number one enemy: fear?", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 222,

As of 10 a.m. Thursday, they had completed the inspections for 876 of them.\n\n(Yonhap)\n\nThe surveyed farms included 683 eco-friendly ones and 193 ordinary ones.\n\nOf the 683 eco-friendly farms, 62 had eggs with traces of insecticides or pesticides. Eggs from eco-friendly farms are usually sold at double the prices of normal ones and should not contain any traces of insecticides.\n\nAmong them, 27 showed excessive levels of such substances, which means their eggs would not be qualified for commercial distribution even without the eco-friendly farm certification.\n\nThese farms were located nationwide, including 15 in Gyeonggi Province, five in South Chungcheong Province, three in South Gyeongsang Province, and one each in North Gyeongsang Province, South Jeolla Province, Gwangju and Gangwon Province. Among them, two were also detected to have used flufenoxuron, which is banned from use.\n\nOf the 193 ordinary farms, four showed traces of insecticides at levels beyond the permitted amount.\n\nThe detected substances from the 66 farms include fipronil, which is banned from use, bifenthrin, flufenoxuron, and etoxazole.\n\nThe ministry said the eco-friendly farms that are found to have used any amount of pesticides would soon be deprived of their certificates.\n\nEggs from 31 farms will all be recalled and discarded, while eggs from the remaining 35 farms will be distributed in the market, but without the eco-friendly tag.\n\nThe nation has been gripped by an unprecedented egg scare since the revelation Tuesday that a farm in Namyangju was found with traces of fipronil, the same substance found in some eggs in Europe that has been stoking worldwide concern.\n\nFipronil is a broad-spectrum insecticide used to treat lice, fleas and ticks but it is not allowed to be used on chickens. Bifenthrin is often used on various agricultural crops to treat insects.\n\nAs the egg scare continued to spread, the government faced rising criticism for having relied on private businesses to review procedures for issuing the eco-friendly certificates, instead of handling them directly.\n\nThe ministry had commissioned 64 private businesses to handle certifying processes. The private businesses performed application reviews, as well as on site investigation on behalf of the government.\n\nThe eco-friendly certificate has been of great appeal to farmers as they can get financial support from the government and can sell their products at a price that is twice higher than usual if their eggs are designated as \"eco-friendly\"\n\nMeanwhile, the nation's egg consumption plunged amid growing concerns over tainted eggs.\n\nSince 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Korea's leading market retailer E-mart has resumed selling eggs, but saw its egg sales drop by 40 percent, compared to the same day last week. Its egg supply also dropped by 44 percent, the company added.\n\nBy Shim Woo-hyun (ws@heraldcorp.com)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt":

One test in Belgium, however, was above the European limit.\n\nPoisoning by small doses has few effects and requires little treatment; however, heavy and prolonged exposure can damage the kidneys and liver or cause seizures.\n\nNeighbouring countries Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany are all blaming each other over the incident, alleging each of them knew about the problem but failed to announce it soon enough.\n\nUnderstandably, it is the poultry farmers who have been hit the hardest, and are blaming the company responsible for mixing the chemicals.\n\nAccording to the EU's Executive Commission, contaminated eggs have been found at producers in four countries; Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nOther countries who imported eggs or egg products from these producers include Austria, Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and Hong Kong.\n\nThe talks will be head on 26 September between EU ministers and food safety agencies. Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva said: \"The aim is to draw the relevant lessons and discuss the ways to continuously improve the effectiveness of the EU system to deal with food fraud.\"\n\nShe added that the EU's \"priority remains to manage the situation, to continue to co-ordinate and to reassure our citizens.\"\n\nFrench Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said that tests on imported eggs contaminated with pesticide show no risk to public health. He added that around 244,000 eggs imported into France from The Netherlands and Belgium were affected.\n\nFrance has also confirmed one farm in the Nord-Pas de Calais region was found to have used Fipronil, and is now blocked from selling eggs. The Agriculture Ministry says the French farm reported on July 28, as the scandal was coming to light, that Dega 16 had been used on the farm by a Belgian subcontractor, and the ministry claims no eggs concerned have been sold.\n\nIn Denmark food safety authorities say 20 tons of boiled and peeled eggs linked to the pesticide scandal were sold in recent months to a distributor in Denmark, who sold them to canteens, caf\u00e9s and catering companies in the country.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "wgt": 100, "id": 39, "label":

It cited data obtained by the government of Lower Saxony from a European Union database.\n\nDutch authorities on Thursday arrested two directors of the company at the center of the food safety scare, with prosecutors saying they suspected them of threatening public health and possession of a prohibited pesticide.\n\nFresh eggs sold in Austria are mostly produced within the country, and the health ministry had said last week there was no indication that the Austrian poultry industry had been affected.\n\nThe first reports of suspected cases in Austria last week involved eggs that had been

Email\n\nA \"SMALL amount\" of liquid eggs from overseas farms linked to a contamination scare was received by food firms in Scotland, according to watchdogs.\n\nFood Standards Scotland said there is unlikely to be any risk to public health and products were immediately taken off the market.\n\nIt emerged last week that hundreds of thousands of eggs from Dutch farms implicated in the Fipronil insecticide contamination scare had been exported to Britain, with some supermarkets removing products from sale.\n\nFSS said investigations revealed \"a small amount of liquid eggs from implicated farms\" was received by Scots food firms.\n\nBut they were unable to say how many eggs were involved as the products identified were imported in liquid or powdered form.\n\nThe watchdogs added: \"It remains the case that it is very unlikely there is any risk to public health from eating these foods and the decision to withdraw these products is not due to food safety.\n\n\"There is no evidence that eggs laid in the UK are contaminated, so there is no need for people in Scotland to stop buying or eating whole eggs from shops.\n\nRead More Top news stories today", "date": "2017-08-17",

However, the phenomenon could influence market processes.\n\nIt was reported last week that eggs contaminated with Fipronil pesticide were found in fifteen European countries, among others, in Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Romania. All of these eggs came from Dutch plantations.\n\nThe Fipronil pesticide is used in veterinary medicine to eradicate parasites, lice, fleas, and ticks. However, it is not used on animals intended for human consumption, because if it gets into the body in a big amount it can cause liver, thyroid and kidney damage.\n\nThe National Food Chain Safety Office added that the dangerousness of the contaminated egg also depends on the age and health condition of the consumer, and the amount of pesticide in the product. Essentially, only the consumption of an extreme amount of poisoned eggs could cause acute poisoning.\n\nIt turned out from laboratory tests that the eggs were contaminated with very little pesticide, the seventh-tenth of the allowed amount. At the same time, a Belgian test showed a bigger amount. The office believes that the long-term risk is what's important in this case. Since Fipronil is a liposoluble agent, it can accumulate in the body, this is why preventive measures serve the purpose of protection from liver damage.\n\nAccording to Attila Nagy, even though the contamination affects a lot of eggs, the rate is still small compared to the European production. The Hungarian egg sector could even profit from the scandal as Hungarian eggs are safe based on the examinations of the National Food Chain Safety Office.\n\nHungarian authorities continuously check the egg supply entering the country and eliminate suspicious eggs.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "wgt": 100, "id": 213, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 214, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "wgt": 100, "id": 470, "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "wgt": 100, "id": 1606, "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Austria"}, "type": "loc", "id": "11"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "loc", "id": "19"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Hungary"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Hungary"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "166"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "type": "loc", "id": "189"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Slovenia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Slovenia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "201"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovak Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovak Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "203"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302504", "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302540", "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302854", "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314576", "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315729", "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316247", "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316248", "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "324300", "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325228", "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "325638", "label": {"eng": "Poison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327117", "label": {"eng": "Tick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "333086", "label": {"eng": "Flea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "355687", "label": {"eng": "Louse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index.hu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "382516", "label": {"eng": "Index.hu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fipronil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "542686", "label": {"eng": "Fipronil"}}]}

None of the other companies, nor Cocovite, were available for comment.\n\nLast night, Buckingham Palace would not comment on whether liquid egg products are purchased from Foodspeed for use in royal kitchens\n\nThe affected products are not used in mass food production and are therefore not in foods on supermarket shelves.\n\nMillions of fresh eggs have been pulled from shelves across Europe after the pesticide fipronil was used illegally on farms in Holland and Belgium.Last week, Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons removed salads, sandwiches and sandwich fillers that used eggs.\n\nThree days ago, Adelie Foods of Hounslow, west London, which supplies millions of sandwiches and 250,000 salad packs a week to shops and cafes, was forced to withdraw tens of thousands of products.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) is investigating whether contaminated eggs were used by UK food manufacturers. Yesterday, it reiterated that it was 'very unlikely' there was any risk to public health from the scandal and that fresh eggs on sale in the UK remain unaffected.\n\nBritish eggs are being tested for fipronil, and all initial results have been clear, it added. FSA chairman Heather Hancock said: 'Our advice remains clear - there's no need to change how you buy or consume eggs.\n\n'We are responding very quickly to any new information, to ensure that any products left that contain egg from the affected farms are withdrawn immediately.\n\n'We're doing this because fipronil is not authorised for use in food-producing animals, not because we are concerned about any risk to health.'", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "wgt": 100, "id": 39, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related

It appears that it was used illegally in a cocktail of chemicals designed to eradicate a red mite infestation of chicken on hundreds of farms in Holland and Belgium.\n\nThe resulting eggs and egg products were subsequently exported to at least 15 other nations. Two people have been arrested by watchdogs investigating the contamination.\n\nThe FSA said: 'Adelie Foods is removing products as part of the on-going traceability investigation of eggs from affected farms.\n\n'This is an on-going investigation, but some of the products identified so far are sandwich and salad products containing eggs, sold to various catering establishments and smaller retailers.\n\n'We have committed to updating our product withdrawal list regularly.

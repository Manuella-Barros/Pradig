{"id": 223668466, "title": "Coronation Street spoilers: New murder evidence changes Lauren case", "text": "Lauren went missing in February (Picture: ITV) A special week of Coronation Street episodes beginning on Monday May 27 will reveal the truth about what really happened to Lauren Bolton (Cait Fitton) \u2013 and there are plenty of twists and turns ahead before we discover who killed Lauren. With Roy Cropper (David Neilson) in prison and currently the police\u2019s chief suspect, recently another far more likely candidate for the killing has come into the picture. Nathan Curtis (Chris Harper), the paedophile who groomed and raped Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) in a horrific ordeal in 2017, has returned to Weatherfield after being released from prison. Bethany is obviously traumatised by his presence, so Sarah (Tina O\u2019Brien) takes drastic action to try to get rid of him. She has a hair bobble belonging to Lauren that was left at the Platts\u2019 and she tries to plant it in Nathan\u2019s van at the building site. She\u2019s spotted by police officer Kit Green (Jacob Roberts), who warns her to let the police do their job. Shortly after that the police arrest Nathan. When Sarah asks Kit if they found anything in the van he says there was a hair belonging to Lauren Bolton.

Daniel worries that if Nathan has been arrested on the evidence of something that Sarah planted he might walk free, so he gets in touch with Nicky Wheatley (Kimberly Hart-Simpson) and begs her to put them in touch with Ellie \u2013 a young woman who was groomed as a teenager and might have information about Lauren. They hope that this could ensure that the case against Nathan is strong enough to convict him.

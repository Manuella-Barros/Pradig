Separately on Saturday, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the city\u2019s character helped it to \u201csail through the wind and waves\u201d, which contributed to his administration\u2019s \u201cincreasingly effective\u201d policies. He made the assessment in a social media post accompanying a video released by his office that showed him on board a ferry discussing the government\u2019s achievements over the past two years. Lee also appeared at an event marking the beginning of celebrations for the July 1 anniversary, where the director of the central government\u2019s liaison office in the city, Zheng Yanxiong, spoke about the value of the \u201cHong Kong spirit\u201d. Zheng said such spirit combined love for both the country and the city, self-reliance, a drive for excellence and a proactive mindset of adapting to changes. \u201c[This spirit] has enabled Hong Kong to overcome various risks and challenges, and achieve success after success,\u201d he said. The liaison office chief reminded residents that Beijing\u2019s support would only become \u201cstronger and stronger\u201d, with more policies that benefited Hong Kong\u2019s development to be introduced. \u201cHong Kong is fully capable of achieving its own better development by integrating into the overall development of the country,\u201d he said. He noted the city had enjoyed great benefits under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d governing principle, which had contributed to its unique and irreplaceable status. Zheng said the city was now \u201csafer, more open, more anticipated and more welcoming\u201d thanks to the introduction of the domestic national security law. Hong Kong enacted the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance earlier this year in accordance with Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city\u2019s mini-constitution. The Beijing official said the people of Hong Kong had never shied away from crises and changes, nor had they feared taking risks and facing competition. \u201cIn the midst of crisis, they will foster new opportunities; amid upheaval, they will open up new frontiers. Through innovation and creativity, they will achieve new breakthroughs and a resurgence for Hong Kong,\u201d he said. Zheng\u2019s remarks were echoed in the video published by the city leader Lee on Saturday, in which he said his administration had \u201cnever been afraid of any challenges and difficulties\u201d and always stood up to tackle problems. \u201cMy administration operates like a ship \u2013 the direction must be correct, the beliefs must be unified, and the speed must continuously accelerate. When facing waves, we will break through them and let this ship move towards the goal,\u201d Lee wrote in his Facebook post introducing the video. \u201cAnd I am pleased to see that many of the policies introduced by this government have become increasingly effective.\u201d In the clip filmed on a Star Ferry vessel crossing Victoria Harbour, Lee reviewed his administration\u2019s work in the two years since he took up the top job in 2022, including the resumption of quarantine-free travel in the wake of the pandemic, the enactment of the Article 23 law, the establishment of community care teams and the application of a policy to ensure only \u201cpatriots\u201d could be involved in district governance. He also highlighted the government\u2019s efforts to address problems in subdivided housing, with the waiting time for public housing being kept below six years. On the economic front, Lee touched on the scrapping of all property cooling measures, which he said allowed \u201ca significant rebound\u201d in transactions and the stable development of the market. The city\u2019s hosting of more than 200 mega events throughout this year would also boost tourism and the retail sector, he said. \u201cLooking to the future, the government will continue to play the role of providing the stage and directing, creating opportunities for Hong Kong. Likewise, various industries must leverage their respective strengths and perform their own roles well,\u201d Lee said. Hong Kong will celebrate the 27th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule on Monday, with discounts at more than 1,000 restaurants and food markets, reduced-price tickets at some attractions, as well as free museum visits and tram rides.", "summary": "Head of Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong praises city\u2019s \u2018spirit\u2019; Chief Executive John Lee upbeat on \u2018increasingly effective\u2019 policies.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3268563/hong-kong-can-sustain-success-if-it-embraces-beijings-support-zheng-yanxiong-says", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/29/85c55a4d-d0df-4340-9b84-35ab125b533e_bfc7f413.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:20:22", "author": "Willa Wu", "authors": ["Willa Wu"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.311}

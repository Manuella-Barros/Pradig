Percy Payne, an employee for Priebe Security stationed at a private underground garage in East Austin, was attacked when he witnessed two \u201cyoung Hispanic males on two electric scooters\u201d trying to break into his car on June 24, according to Fox 7 Austin. As he recalled the brutal attack in an interview with the outlet, Payne\u2019s manager confronted him and told him he couldn\u2019t speak on camera while on the job. \u201cWe are very sorry for what happened to you,\u201d the supervisor started before she berated Payne. \u201cWe have a policy that you\u2019re not supposed to do any interviews in your uniform. If you want to do this as a private citizen, you can,\u201d she added. An argument ensued between the two as the cameras rolled and the supervisor ordered Payne to remove his uniform. Payne attempted to explain to the woman that the interview was the only way he could get his story out, but the supervisor grew frustrated and blamed the guard for being assaulted. The unidentified supervisor again demanded Payne take his uniform off while he complied with the request. \u201cIs it my fault?\u201d Payne, wearing a Cleveland Browns shirt after taking off his uniform, asked after being told he was the one who decided to touch the suspects. \u201cYes, every bit of it,\u201d his superior said. Surveillance footage obtained by the outlet captured Payne\u2019s physical encounter with the two suspects, who allegedly broke into the garage through a door that was stuck open, around 9:30 p.m. He followed the two males downstairs where he saw them standing near his vehicle. \u201cOne individual was at my driver\u2019s door with his back to me, looking back. The other individual was at my passenger door facing me, being a lookout.\u201d After spotting Payne, the two ran off towards a security gate as the 2-on-1 brawl between Payne and the suspects started. \u201cA young individual tried to run me over with his scooter multiple times. And then that\u2019s when they started to assault,\u201d Payne said. During the attack, one of the suspects allegedly shouted, \u201cHold him\u201d as he grabbed a screwdriver from his pocket and attempted to stab Payne. \u201cI let them go and immediately went to get my work phone to call 911,\u201d he said. Payne allegedly told the dispatcher he didn\u2019t need EMS to respond but asked for a police officer, explaining that he had been assaulted. \u201cEven though I told her I had been assaulted, she told me \u2018We will not be sending police officers out there because they did not steal your car.\u2019 And that is when I hung up,\u201d Payne said. After a few minutes, the security guard redialed 911 and got a different dispatcher, and after explaining his situation again received an apology. An officer arrived to meet Payne an hour after the assault who explained that his case should have been an \u201cemergency case\u201d as the department are investigating it as an aggravated assault. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it was taken as seriously as it should\u2019ve been,\u201d Payne said. Payne, a father, has already landed a new job with a different security firm. \u201cI woke up the next morning, was about to really get on Indeed and just start scrolling, because I know I\u2019ve been looking in the medical field and a lot of stuff, but something keeps drawing me back to security,\u201d he said. Michael Cargill, who owns Central Texas Gun Works, told the outlet he was moved by Payne\u2019s story and offered him a job. \u201cHe deserved better,\u201d Cargill said. \u201cThat was just insane. The fact that he was in that predicament in the first place, and the fact that his supervisor was blaming him, his company was blaming him as the person that was in the wrong.\u201d Payne says he is thankful for the new position Cargill offered him. \u201cBless him, this is a blessing, so I\u2019m going to take this. This is an opportunity, it\u2019s a doorway, I\u2019m going to take it, it can lead anywhere,\u201d he added.", "summary": "As he recalled the brutal attack in an interview with Fox 7 Austin, Payne's manager confronted him and told him he couldn't speak on camera while on the job.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/us-news/texas-security-guard-percy-payne-quits-job-during-tv-interview-after-being-assaulted-before-boss-blames-him/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-ycqrlt9a5-1719639345129.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719625039&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:51:05", "author": "Nicholas McEntyre", "authors": ["Nicholas McEntyre"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.653}

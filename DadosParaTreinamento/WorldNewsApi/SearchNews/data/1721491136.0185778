Though the cause is still under investigation, officials are trying to determine if the blaze \"was sparked by a UTV parked next to the garage,\" per WKRN's report. An update shared on social media by the Williamson County Fire/Rescue stated that firefighters were first dispatched to a fire alarm on Sunday night, but \"almost immediately the call was upgraded to a structure fire.\" \"Crews from all eight of our stations responded,\" the statement continued. \"Fairview fire provided a tanker and crew as well. Upon arrival, 1401 found flames coming from the garage. Crews were able to knock down the fire quickly to prevent spread into the house. Firefighters continued to put out hotspots to prevent further spread.\" No additional information was immediately available, and Underwood hasn't addressed the fire on her social media. Hours before the blaze, however, she shared a photo of her and two adorable sheep on her Instagram Stories, with the caption, \"Sheep selfie with Gray and Gary\u2026\" Thankfully Gray, Gary, and the gang escaped harm's way, but it's not the only scary incident that Underwood has encountered of late. During a performance in Myrtle Beach, S.C. on June 9, the singer appeared to slip off the stage during a downpour, though she recovered herself quickly and seemed in good spirits. \u201cWe won\u2019t let a little rain stop us!\u201d she wrote in a social media post afterwards. \u201cWe won\u2019t let a massive downpour stop us, either!\u201d Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. \u201cWell, last night sure was fun!\u201d Underwood wrote in another post after the apparent slip. \u201cAnd though the ending was quite unexpected, it made for a night we\u2019ll never forget!\u201d", "summary": "Underwood, her family, and their pets are all safe after the scary incident.", "url": "https://ew.com/carrie-underwood-garage-fire-put-out-before-flames-spread-to-home-8665052", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/PeKIqaQsLS_nZakYhIuH58Aj0sw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Carrie-Underwood-061724-caf7f679cc174622af2590cc4f2375ca.jpg", "video": "https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/8vWeVlzU-GQ0UtFMY.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:16:59", "author": "Lauren Huff", "authors": ["Lauren Huff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.093}

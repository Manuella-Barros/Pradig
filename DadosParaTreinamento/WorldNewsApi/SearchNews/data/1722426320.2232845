Part of the group arrived overnight by helicopter at Kyiv International Airport, which has been closed since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was the first time in over two years the airport received passengers. The rest of the group arrived by bus. Some of the released civilians had been captured before Russia\u2019s invasion. It\u2019s a rare occasion when people detained after 2014, when Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, were released. Among the freed was Nariman Dzhelyal, deputy head of the Mejlis, a representative body of Crimean Tatars that was relocated to Kyiv after Russia seized the peninsula. He was taken from Crimea, where he lived despite the annexation, one year before the war. \u201cI was in captivity, where many Ukrainians remain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot leave them there, because the conditions, both psychological and physical, are very frightening there.\u201d In the main hall of the airport, where pre-war advertisements still hang, former prisoners wrapped in blue and yellow flags reunited with their families and called those who couldn\u2019t be there. For some, the separation had lasted many years. \u201cI really want to hug you. I\u2019ll be with you soon, Mommy,\u201d said Isabella Pekh, the daughter of freed art historian Olena Pekh, through a video call. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t meet you.\u201d For almost six years, Isabella Pekh spoke at international conferences and appealed to foreign ambassadors for help in freeing her mother, who was detained in the occupied part of the Donetsk region. Eventually, her efforts succeeded. \u201cIt was six years of hell that words cannot describe. But I knew I had my homeland, I had people who loved me, I had my daughter,\u201d said Olena Pekh. Two priests were also among those who returned Friday. One of them, Bohdan Heleta, was detained in 2022 inside his church in the occupied city of Berdiansk in the Zaporizhzhia region. According to Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 3,310 Ukrainians have already been released from Russian captivity. But many thousands, both civilians and military personnel, remain imprisoned.

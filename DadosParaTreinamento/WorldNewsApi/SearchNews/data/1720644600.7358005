Here\u2019s how to work through them effectively. getty The \u201cdesire gap\u201d refers to differences in the level of sexual and affectionate desire between partners. This can manifest in various ways, such as one partner wanting more frequent sexual activity than the other, or differing needs for physical affection and intimacy. While it\u2019s natural for partners to have varying levels of desire over time, strong discrepancies can create conflict if left unaddressed, as they can cause feelings of frustration, rejection, dissatisfaction and disconnection in a relationship. A 2024 study published in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy examined adults\u2019 strategies for managing these discrepancies and found two that may be especially helpful. Here are two ways to manage the desire gap, according to the study. 1. Honest And Direct Communication Effective communication is vital in navigating desire discrepancies. In the study, over 50% of adults with a sexual desire discrepancy and more than 75% with an affectionate desire discrepancy reported using communication strategies.

This strategy relies on respect, consent and mutual understanding. Partners can communicate to find a mutually comfortable level of affection or use positive support strategies, such as verbal affirmations, reminders of love and engaging in more affection at a later time. This can help their partner feel valued even when physical desires are not aligned. They may also slow down their physical behavior to match their partner\u2019s comfort in moments of intimacy. \u201cWe will continue to check in as we proceed\u2014without pressuring for more\u2014to gauge if anything changes over time,\u201d one participant explains. Interestingly, researchers found that participants who did not view sexual discrepancies as problematic were more likely to use communication to resolve them than those who found them problematic. This indicates that it could be important to shift one\u2019s perspective around desire to work through these discrepancies. \u201cWe know that \u2018not feeling it\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018no longer interested\u2019 and isn\u2019t a threat. It took a long time and a lot of difficult communication to get there. Communicating desires and feelings, and being able to comfortably opt out when needed has been an immeasurable improvement,\u201d explains a 43-year-old participant from the study, highlighting the effectiveness of this strategy. 2. Exploring Alternative Forms Of Intimacy In the study, nearly 75% of adults with a sexual desire discrepancy and 29% with an affectionate desire discrepancy chose to participate in alternative sexual or affectionate behaviors. When desires don\u2019t align, engaging in alternative behaviors can help fulfill needs in a way that is satisfying for both partners. Many participants reported opting for non-penetrative sexual activities and focusing on enjoying each other\u2019s presence by spending time sitting near one another, cuddling or giving each other massages. Participants also found that it is possible to maintain closeness and have one\u2019s needs met without necessarily having physical contact and by engaging in nonsexual activities and hobbies together. For affectionate discrepancies, non-human sources like cuddling pets or stuffed animals can also provide comfort. Be Wary Of Unhelpful Strategies Some strategies can be less effective and even be harmful. These include ignoring the discrepancy or hoping it will get better on its own. About 25% of adults with sexual desire discrepancies and 19% with affectionate discrepancies reported doing nothing about them, which can lead to negative emotional coping mechanisms like distraction, frequent suppression of desire or substance use. Some couples give complete control over sexual and affectionate activity to the partner with either higher or lower desire, which can create imbalances and dissatisfaction over time. Further, engaging in intimate behavior without desire, either out of guilt, a desire to please or feeling pressured to is a strategy highly detrimental to one\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s important to address these issues head-on and crucial for both partners to feel willing and enthusiastic about intimate interactions. \u201cCouples experiencing continued difficulties with resolving problematic sexual discrepancies may benefit from exploring mindfulness techniques to improve their ability to be in the moment, and thus communicate their needs and desires or voice their disinterest,\u201d the researchers suggest. Patience and a willingness to work through these differences together are key to finding a resolution that works for both partners. Managing desire discrepancies requires open communication, acceptance of each other\u2019s perspectives, a willingness to explore alternative relationship-affirming behaviors and sometimes professional guidance. By addressing these issues proactively and with empathy, couples can bridge the desire gap and maintain a resilient, healthy relationship.

These would include Patriot missile batteries for which Kyiv has been clamoring after Russia escalated missile and drone attacks on its power plants.\n\nBiden said five countries had agreed to send Patriot and other air defense systems to Ukraine, and that other countries expecting the delivery of the US systems would have to wait because \"everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met.\"\n\nStanding beside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the two signed a 10-year defense pact on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Puglia, Biden added that Kyiv would begin receiving more systems \"relatively quickly.\"\n\nThe US announcement on Thursday will codify Biden's commitment to Kyiv and ensure that Ukraine gets the Patriot systems it needs to protect its cities and critical infrastructure, two of the people with knowledge of the decision told the Financial Times.\n\nThe US-made Patriot systems are Washington's most advanced air defense weapons. They consist of a radar system and mobile launchers that can fire interceptor missiles at incoming projectiles or aircraft.\n\nZelenskyy has called them \"the most effective air defense system in the world today\", and said they were capable of shooting down all Russian missiles, including ballistic ones.\n\nUkraine at present has at least four Patriot systems. Since Zelenskyy made a plea for additional deliveries this spring, Germany has said it would send an additional battery, and the Netherlands announced an initiative to send another based on components supplied by multiple countries. Biden then approved the deployment of another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine last week.\n\nThe Patriot systems and their interceptor missiles have helped protect key government buildings and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities across the country.\n\nZelenskyy said that \"Ukraine is now suffering from the most destructive form of Russia's vision of energy as a weapon.\"\n\nRussian attacks have destroyed more than 9 gigawatts of Ukraine's power generation capacity in recent months, said Zelenskyy, adding that peak energy consumption in Ukraine last winter was 18GW. \"So, half of it does not exist any more.\"\n\nPrime Minister Denys Shmyhal said early this month that the consequences of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector were \"long-term\" and that saving power \"will be part of our daily life in the years to come\".\n\nAs Russia's air attacks continued this week, Serhiy Kovalenko, chief executive of electricity provider Yasno, warned Ukrainians that they faced a realistic possibility of having electricity for just six to seven hours per day next winter.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The White House has considered rescheduling the delivery of air defense systems as well as interceptors and has been willing to do so. But ultimately, it chose to pursue a parallel, intensive effort to equip Ukraine with additional air defense systems, a senior White House official said.\n\nRomania decided on Thursday to donate a Patriot system to Ukraine, according to President Klaus Iohannis' office. Zelenskyy thanked Romania for its crucial contribution.\n\nSpain and Greece also have Patriots in their arsenals, but have so far refused to authorize transfers of launch systems to Ukraine. Poland said its Patriots were protecting infrastructure used to ship Western weapons across its border to Ukraine and so were already deployed to help protect the war-torn country.\n\nAdditionally, Italy announced this month that it would send kyiv a second SAMP/T air defense system, a European-made alternative to the Patriot.\n\nPatriot systems, manufactured in the United States, are Washington's most advanced air defense weapons. They consist of a radar system and mobile launchers capable of firing interceptor missiles at incoming projectiles or aircraft.\n\nZelensky called them the most effective air defense systems in the world today and said they were capable of shooting down all Russian missiles, including ballistic missiles. He said in April that to fully protect Ukraine, Ukraine would need 25 Patriot systems with six to eight batteries each in the future.\n\nHe and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba have since told NATO allies that Ukraine needs a minimum of seven Patriot systems to effectively cover the country's airspace.\n\nUkraine currently has at least four Patriot systems, supplied by the United States and Germany. Since Zelensky advocated for additional deliveries this spring, Germany has said it would send an additional battery, and the Netherlands announced an initiative to send another based on components supplied by several countries. Biden then last week approved the deployment of another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine.\n\nPatriot systems and their interceptor missiles have helped protect key government buildings and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities across the country.\n\nIn at least one case, a Patriot missile shot down a Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft over the Sea of Azov in January, according to two Ukrainian officials with knowledge of the operation and Col. Rosanna Clemente, deputy chief of staff of the army. U.S. 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, speaking at a panel this month.\n\nRecommended\n\nRussia has destroyed or captured more than half of Ukraine's electricity generation, causing the worst blackouts since its large-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow's latest wave of missile and drone attacks has targeted Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including thermal and hydroelectric power plants, which are much more difficult and costly to repair, rebuild or replace.\n\nAddressing munitions shortages and coverage gaps in Ukraine's air defense is essential for the country to defend its critical infrastructure, and is no less important than stabilizing the front line, said Michael Kofman, a senior researcher at the Russia and Eurasia Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International. Peace.\n\nRussian strikes have significantly damaged Ukraine's non-nuclear power generation capacity, and Russian drones are increasingly capable of targeting Ukrainian positions behind the front lines due to lack of air defense coverage.\n\nAdditional reporting by Demetri Sebastopulo in Washington and Henry Foy in Brussels\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

The Patriots shot to fame after downing multiple of Russia's \"invincible\" Kinzhal hypersonic missiles.\n\n\"Indian Army Fought Back, We Did Not\": Philippines Military Expert On Clash With Chinese Troops In SCS\n\nAs Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure escalate, Kyiv has increasingly urged its international partners for enhanced air defenses.\n\nThe American-made Patriot systems have proven highly effective in intercepting Russia's ballistic and cruise missiles, providing a crucial shield for Ukraine. This explains why the US is considering delaying all pending orders until Kyiv's requirements are fulfilled.\n\nThe US is anticipated to make an official announcement on the redirection of Patriot air defense orders on June 20. This decision aims to solidify President Joe Biden's pledge to support Kyiv by ensuring Ukraine receives the defense systems necessary to safeguard its population and infrastructure.\n\nThe decision also follows Biden's declaration that the US had secured commitments from five countries to provide Patriot batteries and other air defense systems to Kyiv.\n\nDuring a press briefing after the G7 summit in Italy on June 13, where he signed a 10-year security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Biden stated, \"We let it be known to those countries that are expecting from us air defense systems in the future that they're going to have to wait. Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries.\"\n\nUkraine received its first Patriot battery from the US in early 2023, and since then, this advanced anti-air system has been instrumental in defending Ukrainian airspace.\n\nSeveral European countries, including Poland, Romania, and Germany, have open orders for Patriot systems, while Spain has requested Patriot launchers. In January, a coalition of NATO states placed an order for 1,000 Patriot missiles.\n\nSwiss tabloid Blick, citing undisclosed sources, recently also reported that American missiles intended for Switzerland will also be redirected to Ukraine. However, on June 13, the US denied reports of plans to deliver an additional Patriot battery to Ukraine.\n\nGermany has committed to delivering three of its own Patriot platforms to Ukraine, and senior German officials have voiced frustration at the lack of similar commitments from other countries. Additionally, the Netherlands has offered various components to help assemble another Patriot battery.\n\nOn June 20, the Romanian government also pledged to send a full Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. The decision comes with the stipulation that the United States and other allies must provide a temporary replacement to fill the gap in Romania's air defenses.\n\nThe Patriot missile system, developed by US defense contractor Raytheon, is among the most advanced air-defense weapons in the Pentagon's arsenal.\n\nIt consists of a complex network of radar, launchers, and interceptor systems capable of firing dozens of missiles in a single engagement to defend against planes, missiles, or rockets. Patriot batteries have been instrumental in protecting Ukrainian troops and civilian infrastructure, particularly around Kyiv, in recent months.\n\n\"Considering the significant deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine ... Council members decided to donate a PATRIOT system to Ukraine,\" stated the Romanian president's office.\n\nThe decision hinges on the condition that the US, referred to as the \"American strategic partner,\" and other allies agree to provide an alternative \"temporary solution\" to ensure Romania's air defense remains intact.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude, stating, \"This crucial contribution will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror.\"\n\nThe commitment from Romania follows discussions in May between Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and US President Joe Biden at the White House, where the potential Patriot system donation was a key topic.\n\n\"I must discuss it in the Supreme Defense Council to see what we can offer and what we can get in return because it is unacceptable to leave Romania without air defenses,\" Iohannis had stated.\n\nWhile several European-made alternatives to the Patriot system exist, including the NASAMS and IRIS-T, the US-developed Patriot systems are widely regarded as the most effective option.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiantimes.com",

The decision comes with the stipulation that the United States and other allies must provide a temporary replacement to fill the gap in Romania's air defenses.\n\nThe Patriot missile system, developed by US defense contractor Raytheon, is among the most advanced air-defense weapons in the Pentagon's arsenal.\n\nIt consists of a complex network of radar, launchers, and interceptor systems capable of firing dozens of missiles in a single engagement to defend against planes, missiles, or rockets. Patriot batteries have been instrumental in protecting Ukrainian troops and civilian infrastructure, particularly around Kyiv, in recent months.\n\n\"Considering the significant deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine ... Council members decided to donate a PATRIOT system to Ukraine,\" stated the Romanian president's office.\n\nThe decision hinges on the condition that the US, referred to as the \"American strategic partner,\" and other allies agree to provide an alternative \"temporary solution\" to ensure Romania's air defense remains intact.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude, stating, \"This crucial contribution will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror.\"\n\nThe commitment from Romania follows discussions in May between Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and US President Joe Biden at the White House, where the potential Patriot system donation was a key topic.\n\nRussian-North Korean Bonhomie 'Angers' South Korea; Could Arm Ukraine In Retaliation - Reports\n\n\"I must discuss it in the Supreme Defense Council to see what we can offer and what we can get in return because it is unacceptable to leave Romania without air defenses,\" Iohannis had stated.\n\nWhile several European-made alternatives to the Patriot system exist, including the NASAMS and IRIS-T, the US-developed Patriot systems are widely regarded as the most effective option.\n\nThis is particularly true when it comes to countering Russia's sophisticated and advanced weaponry. The Patriots' superior technology and proven track record in intercepting and neutralizing various aerial threats make them the preferred choice for ensuring robust air defense capabilities.",

These would include Patriot missile batteries for which Kyiv has been clamouring after Russia escalated missile and drone attacks on its power plants.\n\nBiden said five countries had agreed to send Patriot and other air defence systems to Ukraine, and that other countries expecting the delivery of the US systems would have to wait because \"everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met\".\n\nStanding beside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the two signed a 10-year defence pact on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Puglia, Biden added that Kyiv would begin receiving more systems \"relatively quickly\".\n\nThe US announcement on Thursday will codify Biden's commitment to Kyiv and ensure that Ukraine gets the Patriot systems it needs to protect its cities and critical infrastructure, two of the people with knowledge of the decision told the Financial Times.\n\nPoland, Romania and Germany are among the European nations with open orders for Patriot systems still to be delivered. Spain also has an open order for Patriot launchers, while a coalition of Nato states in January placed an order for 1,000 Patriot missiles.\n\nSpain, Greece and Romania have Patriots in their arsenals, but have so far declined to authorise transfers of launch systems to Ukraine. Poland has said its Patriots are protecting the infrastructure used to ship western weaponry across its border into Ukraine, and thus are already deployed to help protect the war-torn country.\n\nIn addition, Italy said this month it would send Kyiv a second SAMP/T air defence system, a European-made alternative to the Patriot.\n\nUS and Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe US-made Patriot systems are Washington's most advanced air defence weapons. They consist of a radar system and mobile launchers that can fire interceptor missiles at incoming projectiles or aircraft.\n\nZelenskyy has called them \"the most effective air defence system in the world today\" and said they were capable of shooting down all Russian missiles, including ballistic ones.\n\nUkraine at present has at least four Patriot systems, provided by the US and Germany. Since Zelenskyy made a plea for additional deliveries this spring, Germany has said it would send an additional battery, and the Netherlands announced an initiative to send another based on components supplied by multiple countries. Biden then approved the deployment of another Patriot air defence system to Ukraine last week.\n\nThe Patriot systems and their interceptor missiles have helped protect key government buildings and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities across the country.\n\nIn at least one instance, a Patriot missile downed a Russian A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft over the Sea of Azov in January, according to two Ukrainian officials with knowledge of the operation and Colonel Rosanna Clemente, assistant chief of staff at the US 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, speaking on a panel this month.\n\nClemente said Kyiv had \"probably about a battalion of Patriots operating in Ukraine right now\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009being used to protect static sites and critical national infrastructure\".\n\nRussia has knocked out or captured more than half of Ukraine's power generation, causing the worst rolling blackouts since its full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow's latest wave of missile and drone attacks has targeted Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including thermal and hydroelectric power plants, which are much harder and more expensive to fix, rebuild or replace.\n\n\"Addressing the ammunition shortfalls and coverage gaps in Ukraine's air defence is essential for the country to defend critical infrastructure, and no less important than stabilising the front line,\" said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"Russian strikes have significantly damaged Ukraine's non-nuclear power generation capacity, and Russian drones are increasingly able to target Ukrainian positions behind the front lines because of a lack of air defence coverage.\"\n\nSpeaking in Berlin on June 11, Zelenskyy said that \"Ukraine is now suffering from the most destructive form of Russia's vision of energy as a weapon\".\n\nRussian and drone attacks had destroyed more than 9 gigawatts of Ukraine's power generation capacity in recent months, said Zelenskyy, adding that peak energy consumption in Ukraine last winter was 18GW. \"So, half of it does not exist any more.\"\n\nPrime Minister Denys Shmyhal said early this month that the consequences of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector were \"long-term\" and that saving power \"will be part of our daily life in the years to come\".\n\nAs Russia's air attacks continued this week, Serhiy Kovalenko, chief executive of electricity provider Yasno, warned Ukrainians that they faced a realistic possibility of having electricity for just six to seven hours per day next winter.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Russia launches an estimated 3,000 missiles, drones, and other projectiles at Ukraine each month, he noted.\n\nHowever the Patriot system costs about $1 billion and is in high demand worldwide. Just 14 systems are deployed globally.\n\nOrysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme and head of the Ukraine Forum at the thinktank Chatham House, told Newsweek that the move was significant development.\n\n\"It's a reinforcement of Ukraine's defence from damaging missile strikes. Especially, as Ukraine needs to defend its energy network that is it rapidly trying to rebuild ahead of winter. It will also help protect the troops from Russian gliding bombs that are so damaging to Ukrainian troops on the frontlines.\"\n\nHowever, Lutsevych said that the decision was \"one of many necessary steps in the right direction\" for Biden's support of Ukraine and that the U.S. has been frequently guilty of providing military assistance to Kyiv too late.\n\nRegarding the domestic impact, she cited America's continued support for Ukrainian aid, and said: \"enabling Ukrainian success on the battle field would give a boost to Biden electoral campaign.\"\n\nThe Romanian president confirmed that the country would transfer its Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Bucharest said that this would not be a one-way deal.\n\n\"This donation is made on the condition that our country continues negotiations with allies, especially with an American strategic partner, with the aim of obtaining a similar or equivalent system ... At the same time, it is necessary to find a temporary solution to cover the operational vulnerability created in this way,\" the report on the president's website reads.\n\nEarlier this month, Germany committed to sending another Patriot to Kyiv.

The policy decision applies to interceptors the Patriot and other air defense systems use to shoot down incoming missiles and drones.\n\n\"We're going to reprioritize the deliveries of these exports, so that those missiles rolling off the production line will now be provided to Ukraine,\" White House National Security Communications adviser John Kirby told reporters on Thursday. \"This will ensure that we'll be able to provide Ukraine with the missiles they need to maintain their stockpiles at a key moment in the war.\"\n\nThe first shipments of the missiles to Ukraine will happen over the coming weeks, according to Kirby, and Ukraine will see the initial deliveries before the end of the summer. He called the reprioritization a \"difficult but necessary decision.\"\n\nThe countries who have placed orders for the same missiles will still receive them but on a delayed timeline. Kirby said that the focus on Ukraine's inventory will last for roughly the next 16 months, and then after that, other countries will start receiving the missiles they ordered.\n\nIn Italy at the G7 summit earlier this month, President Biden in a press conference with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said, \"Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries.\"\n\nTaiwan is exempt because of its urgent need to also acquire similar capabilities in the face of threats from China.\n\nThe U.S. gave a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine last year after training a small group of Ukrainians at Fort Sill in Oklahoma on how to operate it. The U.S. has also committed several National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile systems and other older air defense systems.\n\nPatriot systems can intercept both cruise and ballistic missiles and have a larger range, up to 100 miles, than the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile system which has a range of 80 miles and can shoot down cruise missiles and drones.\n\nZelenskyy has publicly asked the U.S. and allies to give seven more patriot systems. In Italy last week, he said, \"urgently we need seven Patriot systems -- yes, to save our cities.\"\n\nRussia in its war against Ukraine has targeted civil infrastructure with the apparent goal of depriving Ukrainian citizens of water, heat, and electricity, especially during the winter.\n\nThe U.S. is not alone in providing Ukraine with air defense capabilities. Members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of about 50 countries that meet monthly to discuss how to support Ukraine, have also pledged to help with air defense. After the most recent meeting last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Netherlands is leading an effort to assemble different parts that make up a Patriot system and asking other countries to contribute as well.\n\nThe policy decision to fast track the missiles to Ukraine comes the same week that President Putin of Russia made a visit to North Korea to sign a defense pact as he looks

The Netherlands recently initiated a joint effort to provide an additional air defense battery to Ukraine, urging other nations to contribute essential components. However, countries like Spain, Greece, Romania, and Poland, despite having Patriot systems, have thus far declined to donate them to Kiev.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to Western allies for at least seven more Patriot units amidst escalated Russian bombardments of Ukrainian cities in recent months. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine's demand for interceptor missiles will be prioritized until sufficient defenses are in place to counter Russia's aerial assaults.\n\nInitially, reports suggested a complete halt to all pending orders for Patriot launchers and ammunition. However, subsequent updates clarified that only missile shipments would be affected. Notably, Poland, Romania, and Germany have existing orders for Patriot systems from American manufacturers, alongside a joint contract for 1,000 missiles by several NATO member states since January.\n\nSwitzerland also experienced delays in Patriot interceptor missile deliveries, with the US invoking 'force majeure' due to the Ukraine conflict, allowing contractual adjustments. The Swiss military confirmed the delay following reports in Switzerland's Blick newspaper.\n\nDuring a joint press conference at the G7 summit in Italy, President Biden affirmed that all US air

It aims to send them to Ukraine instead, leaving other countries to wait, per the FT. Ukraine has repeatedly asked for more Patriot systems, but has only received a handful from its allies.\n\nThe US plans to halt open orders for the delivery of Patriot interceptor missiles and send them to Ukraine instead, the Financial Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nAccording to the FT, President Joe Biden said countries expecting deliveries will have to wait because \"everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met.\"\n\nThe move is expected to be announced on Thursday, officials told the FT.\n\nThe US will be \"re-sequencing deliveries\" of air defense systems, including Patriots, \"so interceptors rolling off the production line now are provided to Ukraine,\" an unnamed senior White House official told the outlet.\n\nThe official said the move shows the US' \"commitment\" to supporting partners when they're in \"existential danger\" but is also a message to Russia that \"if they think they can outlast Ukraine in this war, they are mistaken,\" per the outlet.\n\nWashington has briefed all affected countries privately, the FT reported.\n\nSince the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has received only a handful of Patriot missile systems from its allies.\n\nThe Netherlands, Germany, and the US have provided Ukraine with at least three, possibly five, Patriots systems -- however, their precise number and deployment have not been disclosed.\n\nSome Ukrainian allies have refused to send their own systems, like Greece, which says it needs them to protect its airspace.\n\nAccording to unnamed senior military and administration officials who spoke to The New York Times last week, Biden approved the transfer of a second battery from the US earlier this month.\n\nIn April, Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told The Washington Post that his team had identified more than 100 Patriot air-defense systems that its allies could spare.\n\nThe Patriot had a questionable reputation going into the conflict, but has performed extremely well in Ukraine, experts told BI in March, citing upgrades and operators' training.\n\nUkraine used one to down a prized Russian A-50 spy plane earlier this year, and it likely deployed several to take out two Russian planes in January, two analysts told BI at the time.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source":

Kirby said the number will be in the hundreds, and that the decision should give Ukraine what it needs for the next 16 months. At that point, the countries who currently have air defense missiles on order can expect to start seeing theirs delivered.\n\n\"To be clear, those countries will still receive the missiles they have ordered,\" Kirby said. \"It's just that the delivery will take a little longer.\"\n\nHe did not say which countries would be affected by the delays, but noted that the decision will not impact Taiwan or Israel.\n\nLockheed Martin is fully funded by the U.S. Army to build 550 PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles a year at its Camden, Arkansas, production line and hit a rate of 500 per year in December 2023.\n\nWhile the Army has yet to fund another missile production increase, Lockheed has invested internally to build 650 interceptors a year.\n\nIn 2023, Lockheed signed six letters of approval with international customers.\n\nThere are 19 countries with the Raytheon-made Patriot and that customer base is growing. Switzerland purchased five batteries and 75 missiles in November 2022 and Romania plans to buy additional fire units. At least two other European countries are close to announcing plans to buy Patriot, according to Raytheon this spring.\n\nSlovakia has recently expressed interest in purchasing Patriot, and Germany has said it intends to grow its Patriot force.\n\nThe decision is one of the most extraordinary measures America has taken to protect Ukraine since the full-scale war with Russia began two years ago. For months, Pentagon leaders have said that air defense is at the top of the agenda for the countries supporting Kyiv. And they've taken recent steps to prove it.\n\n\"Air defense has been at the top of my agenda for a long time,\" said U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at a June press conference.\n\nAustin spoke at NATO headquarters in Brussels, shortly after a meeting of countries that gather each month to coordinate support for Ukraine. Just before the summit, multiple outlets reported that the U.S. was sending another Patriot system to Ukraine -- though neither Austin nor Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown would confirm the news.\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy said in June his country needs seven Patriot systems, one of the most advanced air defense systems in the world. Germany announced earlier this year that it would send one to Ukraine. The Netherlands similarly committed to assembling and sending another system.\n\nOther countries have committed different air defense systems altogether, such as NASAMS.\n\n\"It's not just Patriots,\" Austin said at the June presser, listing out other systems. \"It's a number of capabilities that Ukraine needs, and they need the interceptors to complement the platforms.\"\n\nShort supply\n\nDespite their importance, both air defense batteries and the interceptors they fire are in short supply. The U.S. and its allies have spent much of the war sourcing whatever extra weapons are available -- especially as Ukraine faced drone and missile barrages on its cities and critical infrastructure. The decision this week reflects how tight the supply chain for these systems is. Rather than expanding capacity, the U.S. has reordered it.\n\n\"It's a reminder of the importance of expanding inventory,\" said Tom Karako, an expert on air defense at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, of the decision.\n\nKarako said that the money meant to expand that capacity included in the April national security supplemental -- a massive refresh of security aid to Ukraine and other countries -- hasn't been spent yet. Though there is around $48 billion for military aid to Ukraine in the package, the amount marked for air defense isn't specified, he said.\n\n\"You don't just turn on a dime and start spitting out Patriots like a Xerox machine,\" Karako said.\n\nThe White House didn't specify what countries will be affected by the reshuffle, though Karako said that the likely candidates will be in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nKirby said that Washington would do what it could to shorten any delays.\n\nStill, he said, \"each country is going to have a different set of circumstances that apply to that based on what they've ordered and what their own self-defense needs are.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jen_judson@yahoo.com", "name":

of this winter.\"\n\nRussia has resumed its aerial pounding of Ukraine's power grid while Kyiv's forces are again targeting Russian oil facilities with drone strikes, as each side seeks to hinder the other's ability to continue fighting.\n\nThe number of interceptors to be sent isn't clear but Kirby said it could involve \"hundreds\" of Patriot interceptor missiles.\n\nKirby said Ukraine will get prioritized shipments as soon as systems roll off assembly lines for the next about 16 months, and those will provide the country with \"enough capability\" during that period.\n\nAfter that, he said, \"Countries that have been asked to delay will start to get\" deliveries of systems they had already ordered.\n\nKirby said the move means \"a range of countries\" will face delays in receiving missile systems that are being diverted to Ukraine but that the shift would not affect Taiwan or what it \"continues to need and receive for self-defense\" in the face of potential threats from China.\n\nAsked to describe how other countries reacted to the shift, Kirby said they were \"broadly understanding of it.\"\n\n\"They know how serious the need is in Ukraine,\" he said.", "source":

Late last month, the Netherlands launched a joint initiative to deliver one more air defense battery to Ukraine, calling on several other nations to donate separate constituent parts. While Spain, Greece, Romania and Poland have Patriots at their disposal, they have so far refused to donate them to Kiev.\n\nUkraine's Vladimir Zelensky has asked Western backers to deliver at least seven more Patriot units amid an intensified Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities in recent months.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Thursday that Ukraine's demand for interceptor missiles would take precedence until the country \"has enough to defend itself from Russia's air attacks.\" The original story suggested that all other orders - both for Patriot launchers and ammunition - would be halted. However, its authors later amended the article to say the restrictions would only affect missiles.\n\nThe newspaper noted that Poland, Romania and Germany all have open orders with American manufacturers for Patriot systems, with a separate outstanding contract for 1,000 missiles placed by a group of NATO member states back in January.\n\nOn Tuesday, Switzerland's Blick newspaper reported that the US had delayed the scheduled delivery of Patriot interceptor missiles to the country, citing the Ukraine conflict as 'force majeure', which allows for the contract to be altered. The Swiss military later confirmed that the report was true.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with Zelensky on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy last Thursday, President Biden said countries that are expecting US air defense systems would have to wait.\n\nThe US head of state explained that \"everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met.\"", "source":

This will require the Biden administration to delay the shipment of such systems to other allies and partners across the globe, a move that the White House described as \"difficult but necessary,\" The Washington Post reported.\n\n\"We have, of course, informed all the affected countries that we are taking this extraordinary step, and we're making every effort to minimize any negative impact,\" White House National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told reporters, according to the Post.\n\n\"The broader message here to Russia is clear. If you think you're going to be able to outlast Ukraine, and if you think you're going to be able to outlast those of us who are supporting Ukraine, you're just flat-out wrong,\" Kirby said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt wasn't clear from Kirby's comments how long U.S. allies would be kept waiting, according to the Post. The countries that would be affected by the delay also weren't specified, but Kirby told reporters that it would not affect Israel or Taiwan.\n\nThe Patriot and NASAMS, surface-to-air systems, have played a key role in providing Ukraine with defenses against Russian drone and missile attacks. Delivering missiles for the system to Ukraine will take top priority over the next 16 months, a senior U.S. official told the WSJ.\n\nIn addition to the missiles, Kyiv has also been seeking more batteries for the system, the WSJ reported. Ukraine currently has at least four Patriot systems, provided by the U.S. and Germany, according to the Financial Times.\n\n\"Can we get seven?\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The New York Times in an interview in May, regarding the Patriot.\n\nThe White House's announcement on Thursday reflects Ukraine's urgent need for military support in its war against Russia. Ukraine's domestic weapons production is not on par with that of the West or Russia, and Kyiv has relied on the West to provide the necessary armaments to stave off Russian forces.\n\nThe U.S. alone has provided Ukraine with $175 billion in total aid, roughly $70 billion of which is solely military assistance, according to The Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nEven with Western aid, Ukraine has struggled to hold its ground against Russian forces in the eastern theater of the war.

(Sean Murphy/AP)\n\nThe U.S. moved Ukraine to the front of the line for its sales of air defense interceptors -- one of the most critical weapons in Ukraine's self-defense.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced the reshuffle in a briefing today, calling it \"difficult but necessary.\" In the short-term, he said, Patriot and NASAM interceptors that had been slated for other countries will now go to Ukraine.\n\n\"As a result, deliveries for these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed,\" Kirby said.\n\nThe White House expects Ukraine will receive these air defense weapons by the end of the summer. Kirby said the number will be in the hundreds, and that the decision should give Ukraine what it needs for the next 16 months. At that point, the countries who currently have air defense missiles on order can expect to start seeing theirs delivered.\n\n\"To be clear, those countries will still receive the missiles they have ordered,\" Kirby said. \"It's just that the delivery will take a little longer.\"\n\nHe did not say which countries would be affected by the delays, but noted that the decision will not impact Taiwan or Israel.\n\nLockheed Martin is fully funded by the U.S. Army to build 550 PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles a year at its Camden, Arkansas, production line and hit a rate of 500 per year in December 2023.\n\nWhile the Army has yet to fund another missile production increase, Lockheed has invested internally to build 650 interceptors a year.\n\nIn 2023, Lockheed signed six letters of approval with international customers.\n\nThere are 19 countries with the Raytheon-made Patriot and that customer base is growing. Switzerland purchased five batteries and 75 missiles in November 2022 and Romania plans to buy additional fire units. At least two other European countries are close to announcing plans to buy Patriot, according to Raytheon this spring.\n\nSlovakia has recently expressed interest in purchasing Patriot, and Germany has said it intends to grow its Patriot force.\n\nThe decision is one of the most extraordinary measures America has taken to protect Ukraine since the full-scale war with Russia began two years ago. For months, Pentagon leaders have said that air defense is at the top of the agenda for the countries supporting Kyiv. And they've taken recent steps to prove it.\n\n\"Air defense has been at the top of my agenda for a long time,\" said U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at a June press conference.\n\nAustin spoke at NATO headquarters in Brussels, shortly after a meeting of countries that gather each month to coordinate support for Ukraine. Just before the summit, multiple outlets reported that the U.S. was sending another Patriot system to Ukraine -- though neither Austin nor Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown would confirm the news.\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy said in June his country needs seven Patriot systems, one of the most advanced air defense systems in the world. Germany announced earlier this year that it would send one to Ukraine. The Netherlands similarly committed to assembling and sending another system.\n\nOther countries have committed different air defense systems altogether, such as NASAMS.\n\n\"It's not just Patriots,\" Austin said at the June presser, listing out other systems. \"It's a number of capabilities that Ukraine needs, and they need the interceptors to complement the platforms.\"\n\nDespite their importance, both air defense batteries and the interceptors they fire are in short supply. The U.S. and its allies have spent much of the war sourcing whatever extra weapons are available -- especially as Ukraine faced drone and missile barrages on its cities and critical infrastructure. The decision this week reflects how tight the supply chain for these systems is. Rather than expanding capacity, the U.S. has reordered it.\n\n\"It's a reminder of the importance of expanding inventory,\" said Tom Karako, an expert on air defense at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, of the decision.\n\nKarako said that the money meant to expand that capacity included in the April national security supplemental -- a massive refresh of security aid to Ukraine and other countries -- hasn't been spent yet. Though there is around $48 billion for military aid to Ukraine in the package, the amount marked for air defense isn't specified, he said.\n\n\"You don't just turn on a dime and start spitting out Patriots like a Xerox machine,\" Karako said.\n\nThe White House didn't specify what countries will be affected by the reshuffle, though Karako said that the likely candidates will be in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nKirby said that Washington would do what it could to shorten any delays.\n\nStill, he said, \"each country is going to have a different set of circumstances that apply to that based on what they've ordered and what their own self-defense needs are.\"", "source": {"uri": "defensenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Defense News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But Kirby said that more was urgently needed as Russia's military has accelerated missile and drone attacks against cities and infrastructure centers \"trying to destroy Ukraine's energy system ahead of this winter.\"\n\nRussia has resumed its aerial pounding of Ukraine's power grid while Kyiv's forces are again targeting Russian oil facilities with drone strikes, as each side seeks to hinder the other's ability to continue fighting.\n\nThe number of interceptors to be sent isn't clear but Kirby said it could involve \"hundreds\" of Patriot interceptor missiles.\n\nKirby said Ukraine will get prioritized shipments as soon as systems roll off assembly lines for the next about 16 months, and those will provide the country with \"enough capability\" during that period.\n\nAfter that, he said, \"Countries that have been asked to delay will start to get\" deliveries of systems they had already ordered.\n\nKirby said the move means \"a range of countries\" will face delays in receiving missile systems that are being diverted to Ukraine but that the shift would not affect Taiwan or what it \"continues to need and receive for self-defense\" in the face of potential threats from China.\n\nAsked to describe how other countries reacted to the shift, Kirby said they were \"broadly understanding of it.\"\n\n\"They know how serious the need is in Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The U.S. is expected to send more MIM-104 Patriot systems, crucial for intercepting Russian attacks. Germany has also provided interceptors.\n\n-Despite ongoing challenges, Ukrainian forces have adapted swiftly, mastering new weapon systems under dire conditions to protect civilians and maintain essential services.\n\nThe air war over Ukrainian cities is one of the most important battles of the war.\n\nThrough ballistic and cruise missiles and suicide drones, the Russian military is looking to sap Ukrainian morale while also taking out critical infrastructure and facilities.\n\nOn the other side, the Ukrainian military uses a combination of cutting-edge Western and older Soviet air defense weapon systems to fend off the rain of death.\n\nWithout help from the United States and NATO, Ukraine would have lost this crucial air battle long ago. But to continue fighting back, Kyiv needs a steady supply of air defense weapon systems and munitions.\n\nTo answer the call, the U.S. will likely send another batch of MIM-104 Patriot air defense weapon systems to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to reports, Ukraine will soon receive additional MIM-104 Patriot anti-aircraft batteries from the U.S. military.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has received several MIM-104 Patriot batteries from the U.S.-led international coalition. In addition, the Ukrainian Air Force, which operates the country's air defenses, is using IRIS-T and NASAMS air defense weapon systems.\n\nBut it is not just about the weapon system itself but also about the munitions that it fires. The MIM-104 Patriot uses PAC-3 and PAC-2 missiles; PAC-3 munitions go after the warhead of an incoming enemy missile, while PAC-2 munitions explode next to the incoming munition to shoot it down. Germany has been helping with that, providing dozens of munitions to the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\n\"And especially after seeing how critical air defense is to Ukraine's survival, today I have the pleasure of announcing the delivery of a significant number of interceptors for the Patriot - one hundred,\" the German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius said during a recent joint press conference with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Ukrainian air defenses have performed well in the conflict so far. To be sure, Russian munitions of all types continue to pass through Kyiv's anti-air umbrella, but that is to be expected.\n\nThe large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered a new era for the Ukrainian military and forced an abrupt change. Over the span of a few months, the Ukrainian forces had to learn how to operate dozens of new weapon systems. Moreover, there wasn't any grace period. Russian missiles, drones, and aircraft rained death and destruction on a daily basis, killing families and bringing down critical infrastructure, thus denying basic goods like water, power, and internet to millions of Ukrainians.\n\nMany times, Ukrainian troops had to first learn English so that they could participate in the training of the new weapon systems. That has been particularly the case with complex weapon systems like anti-aircraft weapons, main battle tanks, and fighter aircraft.\n\nThe Ukrainian air defenses ensure that innocent people don't wake up learning that their families have been killed by an errant Russian missile or drone.

But obviously, more is needed and it's needed now.\"\n\nIn light of these heightened Russian strikes, Mr. Kirby said the U.S. government will move deliveries of air defense missiles for Ukraine ahead of those for other countries who have ordered those same weapons and are awaiting deliveries.\n\n\"The United States firmly believes that this is the best course of action right now to support Ukraine while still ensuring other partners receive the air defense missiles and capabilities that they've committed to purchase, again, on a delayed timeline,\" he said.\n\nMr. Kirby said the U.S. government expects to be able to deliver new batches of Patriot missiles to Ukraine \"over the coming weeks\" and \"certainly before the end of the summer.\"\n\nHe said the focus will remain on bolstering Ukraine's air defense for about the next year and a half.\n\n\"We'll provide [Ukraine] enough capabilities over the rest of this fiscal year. And of course, all next fiscal year. So about 16 months will be the focus of the timeframe to fill out Ukraine's inventory, and then after that the countries that have been asked to delay will start to get their deliveries,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\nHe gave assurances that this reprioritization of air defense missiles for Ukraine would not affect U.S. deliveries of similar systems to Israel as it deals with rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah or Taiwan as it contends with long-running tensions with neighboring China.\n\nThe White House official said the U.S. government has notified other countries affected by this reprioritization of military assistance and said they've generally been understanding and in many cases \"fully supportive\" of the decision.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has increasingly asked his Western backers for help blunting long-range strikes in recent weeks, as Russian forces have increasingly appeared to fire long-range weapons within the relative safety of their borders, which then hit targets inside Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe Biden administration has given some sign-off for Kyiv's forces to use U.S.-donated weapons to intercept long-range weapons and hit other Russian targets inside Russia's borders before they can strike Ukrainian territory.\n\nStill, the Zelenskyy government has signaled a need for additional resources to stop Russian weapons over Ukrainian airspace.\n\nLast week, President Biden and Mr. Zelenskyy signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement, which specifically includes a U.S. commitment to help sustain Ukrainian air defenses and their Patriot missile systems, along with other measures of assistance.\n\nWhile Ukraine is getting military assistance from the United States and other Western supporters, Russia appears focused on expanding its own international security partnerships to sustain its war in Ukraine.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this week that the People's Republic of China has been the main supporter of the Russian war effort in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. government has assessed Iran and North Korea have supplied Russia with other weapons, such as missiles, explosive-laden one-way attack drones, and rounds of ammunition.\n\nMr. Kirby said during the press call that Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit this week to North Korea to sign a new bilateral partnership agreement is a sign of his desperation and fear of isolation on the global stage.\n\n\"[Russia's] reaching out to North Korea for missiles ... they're still getting drones from Iran. They don't have a lot of friends in the world. And they're trying to do everything they can to pull on the strings of the friends that they do have,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\n\"Russia is absolutely isolated on the world stage.\"", "source": {"uri":

It is evident, as total military assistance over the past two years is just $149 billion from all partners, including the US, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, considered the best tracker of international aid to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, how exactly will this money help Ukraine win the war against Russia? The answer is not obvious, but Euromaidan Press has searched for the answer.\n\nWhile the ethical, economic, and legal arguments for confiscation are well-known, Western countries remain cautious. The EU has decided to provide Ukraine with $3 billion annually from the proceeds of frozen Russian funds, and the G7 approved a one-time $50 billion loan to be repaid from the same proceeds.\n\nKyiv continues to push for full confiscation, and for a good reason: the entire body of frozen Russian assets would go a long way toward funding Ukraine's fight. Euromaidan Press consulted Ukrainian defense expert Ivan Kyrychevskyi to determine how many air defense systems, jets, and tanks could be purchased for Ukraine's military with $300 billion and how this would contribute to victory.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Ukraine's actual defense spending in 2023 reached $64.8 billion, significantly higher than the officially stated figure of $40 billion.\n\n\"If we take SIPRI's estimate as the upper limit and compare it to these $300 billion, it turns out that the confiscated Russian assets could potentially provide Ukraine with a security cushion for 5 years,\" Ukrainian defense expert Ivan Kyrychevskyi told Euromaidan Press.\n\nHowever, the $300 billion alone is not a guaranteed recipe for victory in the war, as money is just one component. Moreover, it is uncertain what portion of these assets is readily available and can be immediately directed toward purchasing weapons for Ukraine. It is likely that not all of these assets can be quickly converted into cash.\n\nEven with available funds, buying weapons is not straightforward. They must be physically available, and if an Abrams tank, which according to Reuters costs $10 million per unit, is not available for purchase, the money will not help.\n\nAnother issue is that due to the rapid increase in demand, prices for military equipment, including old equipment, are rising dramatically.\n\n\"It is difficult to provide specific figures now because Ukraine is in a situation where it needs everything and as much as possible,\" Kyrychevskyi notes.\n\nAccording to President Zelenskyy, to fully secure Ukraine's airspace, Kyiv needs 25 Patriot air defense systems or equivalents. However, since each system must be individually requested, Kyiv is currently focused on obtaining 7 Patriots.\n\n\"To fully cover Ukraine, it would be ideal to have 25 Patriot systems with 6-8 batteries each. All our partners are well aware of this and even know the exact locations where the systems should be deployed,\" Zelenskyy stated in April on Ukrainian TV.\n\nMoreover, due to the structural shortcomings of the Patriot system, one launcher is not enough to protect an object. Its radar has limited angles of view, so even more radars are needed. To cover one target, a fire unit up to 8 launchers is required. For example, in 2020-2021, according to Ukrainian army calculations, 4 fire units were needed to protect Kyiv.\n\nIn April, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that his team has identified more than 100 available Patriots, with some neighboring countries having more than one battery guarding ports or airfields.\n\n\"I'm sorry to spoil the birthday party, but who can believe that the mightiest military alliance in the world cannot find seven batteries of Patriots to provide them to the only country in the world that is fighting ballistic attacks every day?\" Kuleba said during a meeting in Brussels marking NATO's 75th anniversary.\n\nDefense expert Kyrychevskyi explains that the situation is not that simple.\n\nFor example, Greece has 38 Patriot systems, but they are needed to address an unresolved conflict with T\u00fcrkiye and to protect Saudi Arabian oil fields as part of agreements with the US. Similarly, France's 60 SAMP/T systems are committed to allied obligations worldwide. The US, with around 400 Patriots, has determined that this number is insufficient against China or Russia.\n\n\"It turned out that the only Patriots that are idle and literally gathering dust are in Romania. Three batteries. Therefore, the notion that there are hundreds of spare Patriots somewhere that no one is giving to Ukraine may be a miscalculation,\" Kyrychevskyi explains.\n\nWhile the US manufacturer of Patriots, Lockheed Martin, would likely accept contracts from Ukraine, aided by confiscated Russian assets, production timelines are long.\n\n\"The production cycle of an air defense system can take up to two years, but this way, Ukraine could prepare a safety cushion for when Soviet air defense systems can no longer function in any format,\" says Kyrychevskyi.\n\nUkraine had 250 S-300 and 50 Buk air defense systems, which are gradually failing due to a lack of spare parts and missiles. To extend their life and increase efficiency, the American-Ukrainian FrankenSam program was launched in 2023 to create hybrids by installing Western components on Soviet equipment or retrofitting them to launch Western missiles.\n\nFor example, a Patriot launch unit is installed on Soviet air defense systems to allow them to cover a larger area. Other options include American AIM-7/RIM-7 missiles on the Buk system or combining Patriot missiles and launch units with Ukrainian radars.\n\n\"FrankenSam is a temporary solution, as the aging equipment has a finite lifespan. Ultimately, Ukraine's entire old air defense infrastructure must be replaced with modern systems, which would require an investment of around $300 billion to properly fortify our long-term air defenses - an obvious necessity that has gone largely unstated,\" notes Kyrychevskyi.\n\nUkraine could also benefit from the THAAD anti-ballistic missile system, which Kyiv has long been requesting from the US. It is designed to intercept ballistic missiles at ranges up to 200 km and altitudes up to 100-150 km. THAAD is extremely expensive - $2 billion per battery. Therefore, its only export customer so far is Saudi Arabia. Even South Korea could not afford to buy THAAD.\n\n\"Long-term weapons contracts for Ukraine would ensure a steady supply of arms and support Western defense industries. This is crucial, as there is a clear challenge in financing Ukraine's defense sector after the war when the current intensive weapons supplies from the West cease,\" explains Kyrychevskyi.\n\nPrecise data on the Ukrainian military's size, needs, and provisions are currently classified. However, some insights have emerged publicly. In February 2023, former Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov provided a glimpse into the number of rounds needed by Ukraine to sustain its defense efforts.\n\n\"If we calculate the amount of small arms ammunition in 5.45 caliber (for assault rifles) based on official standards, we would need to purchase and stockpile 64 billion rounds. Considering that the world's population is 8 billion people. In monetary terms, that's $27 billion. Just for the ammunition,\" Reznikov explained.\n\n64 billion rounds is completely unrealistic: that many don't exist and won't be produced, Kyrychevskyi says.\n\nIn November 2023, Ukrainian officials informed Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin during his Kyiv visit that Ukraine requires 17 million artillery shells (Russia or even China do not have that much), and deoccupying all of Ukraine would cost $350-400 billion in forces and resources.\n\nThese numbers stem from military doctrines outlining ammunition expenditures for objectives.\n\n\"To destroy an enemy platoon position by Soviet standards, 1,000 152mm rounds are needed. Using more accurate 155mm shells could reduce this, but it's clear: eliminating even small enemy positions requires immense artillery ammunition volumes,\" Kyrychevskyi explains.\n\nMoreover, the rising drone warfare intensifies munitions demands.\n\n\"The war's totality means Ukrainian military needs may surpass the world's greatest militaries. However, funding it is crucial,\" the analyst states.\n\nAccording to The Military Balance, an annual assessment of military capabilities and defense economics by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Ukraine had 858 tanks for its army of approximately 1 million at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion, while Russia had as many as 13,700 tanks.\n\nA Ukrainian tank battalion consists of 31 vehicles, while some NATO countries believe 44 tanks are insufficient and that 56 are needed.\n\n\"It is necessary to increase the existing tank fleet by one and a half to two times, and our allies know the real number of Ukrainian tanks very well,\" says the analyst.\n\nThe cost of a Leopard-2 tank for German taxpayers in the 80s and 90s was \u20ac2 million per unit. Now, the same refurbished and restored Leopard-2 is being sold for \u20ac40 million. Similarly, the price of the American Abrams tank has increased from $10 million to $50 million per unit.\n\nThe prices of Indian Arjun and South Korean K2 Black Panther tanks have also risen significantly due to a sharp increase in demand, despite plans to close their production.\n\nFor comparison, a US Army mechanized brigade has around 100 Abrams tanks and 120 Bradley IFVs. The entire US Army, with 426,000 personnel, has at least 2,500 Abrams tanks and several thousand Bradleys.\n\nTo build an offensive force that can achieve superiority in numbers and firepower, Ukraine must strive for the ideal standard: the US Army's level of equipment.\n\n\"While the exact numbers between our current level and the US Army's can be discussed based on needs and realistic possibilities, one thing is clear. Without meeting Ukraine's needs to the fullest extent possible, it is unrealistic to expect readiness for a successful counteroffensive with a mere 50 Leopard tanks,\" Kyrychevskyi explained.\n\nTanks are essential for both offensive and defensive operations. Ukraine is currently utilizing old German Leopard-1 tanks in its defense, which, despite having poor protection, are well-suited for defensive roles.\n\nIn May, President Zelenskyy stated Ukraine needs 120-130 modern jets to attain air parity with Russia's 300 fighters.\n\nWith $300 billion, Ukraine could secure prospective long-term contracts for advanced military equipment with multi-year production timelines.\n\nFor instance, securing the F-16 Viper fighters would cost around $1 billion per 10-12 aircraft squadron. Commercial orders for these are already backlogged until the 2030s.\n\n\"The F-16s from Europe will last a maximum of 10 years in the war. So Ukraine must get in line now for new aircraft production runs. Long-term contracts could provide significant fighter numbers, not just one squadron like some Eastern European countries ordered with 2-3 year delays,\" Kyrychevskyi explains.\n\nUkraine has also long sought US Boeing C-17 strategic transport aircraft to bolster its aging airlift capabilities predating 2022. Moreover, early in the invasion, Kyiv requested 100 retired US Air Force A-10 Warthog attack jets from stockpiles.\n\n\"However, the Pentagon remained silent on those A-10s being essentially stripped for spares a decade ago to sustain the operational fleet,\" the analyst notes.\n\nAs far-right politicians gain traction in Europe, concerns arise over their potential to cease military aid to Ukraine funded by EU member states' budgets. However, an interesting dynamic emerges - right-wing leaders' fondness for lucrative defense contracts.\n\nSlovakia's pro-Russian PM Fico exemplifies this, stating no more free aid to Ukraine, yet Slovak defense firms continue commercial production of Zuzana-2 howitzers and 155mm ammunition for Ukrainian contracts.\n\n\"In fact, Slovakia has already given everything that could be given away for free. But no one has terminated the commercial contracts under which weapons for Ukraine are being produced. The only limitation is that Slovakia cannot produce anything other than artillery,\" explains Kyrychevskyi.\n\nSimilarly, though Serbia verbally backs Russia, its reactive munitions still reach Ukrainian forces via third countries, highlighting defense dealings transcending political rhetoric.\n\nCrucially, the confiscated $300 billion in Russian assets could insulate Ukraine's defense from Western political turbulence. This fund would sufficiently sustain arms procurement regardless of electoral shifts.\n\n\"Transferring resources from confiscated Russian assets to Ukraine's defense would create long-term military supply opportunities independent of any electoral cycles,\" the analyst says.\n\n****\n\nSecuring the confiscated Russian assets for Ukraine's defense would be a game-changer, allowing the country to invest in long-term military contracts, modernize its air defense systems, and build a more formidable tank fleet. This financial stability would play a crucial role in Ukraine's efforts to counter Russian aggression and defend its sovereignty.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news",

But obviously more is needed, and it's needed now. So as a result, the United States government has made the difficult but necessary decision to reprioritize near-term planned deliveries of foreign military sales to other countries of particularly Patriot and NASAMS missiles to go to Ukraine instead.\"\n\nThe decision currently applies only to interceptor missiles, but the US did examine the possibility of expanding it to include air defense systems, including launchers, radars and other support equipment. The decision was made to limit it to interceptors because \"we just don't have eligible systems coming off the production line,\" said Kirby.\n\nThe interceptor sales to other countries are not being canceled but will face significant delays. Affected countries have been informed of the \"extraordinary step,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"If any of our other partners were ever in a situation similar to Ukraine's, we would go to extraordinary lengths to support their security as well,\" he added. \"This decision demonstrates our commitment to supporting our partners when they're in existential danger.\"\n\nAsked about the response from affected countries, Kirby said the nations were \"broadly understanding of it.\"\n\nIt is unclear how many nations are having their shipments delayed by the decision, or how long the delays will last, but the White House said deliveries of interceptors to Israel and Taiwan will not be affected.\n\nThe prioritization effort is expected to last 16 months to allow Ukraine to fill out its inventories \"and then after that the countries that have been asked to delay will start to get their deliveries,\" said Kirby.\n\nThe first redirected shipments are expected to reach Ukraine in the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASAMS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASAMS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interceptor aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MIM-104 Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Military_Sales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Military Sales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/06/20/thumbs_b_c_e12f195e1f102673d03130d71180478d.jpg?v=205559", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667386", "eventUri": "eng-9667386", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

But obviously more is needed and it's needed now.\"\n\nIn light of these heightened Russian strikes, Mr. Kirby said the U.S. government will move deliveries of air defense missiles for Ukraine ahead of those for other countries who have ordered those same weapons and are awaiting deliveries.\n\n\"The United States firmly believes that this is the best course of action right now to support Ukraine, while still ensuring other partners receive the air defense missiles and capabilities that they've committed to purchase, again, on a delayed timeline,\" he continued.\n\nMr. Kirby said the U.S. government expects to be able to deliver new batches of Patriot missiles to Ukraine \"over the coming weeks\" and \"certainly before the end of the summer.\"\n\nHe said the focus will remain on bolstering Ukraine's air defense for about the next year and a half.\n\n\"We'll provide [Ukraine] enough capabilities over the rest of this fiscal year. And of course, all next fiscal year. So about 16 months will be the focus of the timeframe to fill out Ukraine's inventory, and then after that the countries that have been asked to delay will start to get their deliveries,\" he said.\n\nMr. Kirby gave assurances that this reprioritization of air defense missiles for Ukraine would not impact U.S. deliveries of similar systems to Israel as it deals with rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah, or Taiwan as contends with long-running tensions with neighboring China.\n\nThe White House official said the U.S. government has notified other countries impacted by this reprioritization of military assistance, and said they've generally been understanding and in many cases \"fully supportive\" of the decision.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has increasingly asked his Western backers for help blunting long-range strikes in recent weeks, as Russian forces have increasingly appeared to fire long-range weapons within the relative safety of their borders, which then hit targets inside Ukrainian territory.\n\nStill, the Zelenskyy government has signaled a need for additional resources to stop Russian weapons over Ukrainian airspace.\n\nWhile Ukraine is getting military assistance from the United States and other Western supporters, Russia appears focused on expanding its own international security partnerships to sustain its war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. government has assessed Iran and North Korea have supplied Russia with other weapons, such as missiles, explosive-laden one-way attack drones, and rounds of ammunition.\n\n\"[Russia's] reaching out to North Korea for missiles ... they're still getting drones from Iran. They don't have a lot of friends in the world. And they're trying to do everything they can to pull on the strings of the friends that they do have,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\n\"Russia is absolutely isolated on the world stage.\"", "source": {"uri":

This will require the Biden administration to delay the shipment of such systems to other allies and partners across the globe, a move that the White House described as \"difficult but necessary,\" The Washington Post reported. (RELATED: Putin Offers Ceasefire To Ukraine -- But Makes Exhaustive Demands For Deal)\n\n\"We have, of course, informed all the affected countries that we are taking this extraordinary step, and we're making every effort to minimize any negative impact,\" White House National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told reporters, according to the Post.\n\n\"The broader message here to Russia is clear. If you think you're going to be able to outlast Ukraine, and if you think you're going to be able to outlast those of us who are supporting Ukraine, you're just flat-out wrong,\" Kirby said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt wasn't clear from Kirby's comments how long U.S. allies would be kept waiting, according to the Post. The countries that would be affected by the delay also weren't specified, but Kirby told reporters that it would not affect Israel or Taiwan.\n\nThe Patriot and NASAMS, surface-to-air systems, have played a key role in providing Ukraine with defenses against Russian drone and missile attacks. Delivering missiles for the system to Ukraine will take top priority over the next 16 months, a senior U.S. official told the WSJ.\n\nIn addition to the missiles, Kyiv has also been seeking more batteries for the system, the WSJ reported. Ukraine currently has at least four Patriot systems, provided by the U.S. and Germany, according to the Financial Times.\n\n\"Can we get seven?\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The New York Times in an interview in May, regarding the Patriot.\n\nThe White House's announcement on Thursday reflects Ukraine's urgent need for military support in its war against Russia. Ukraine's domestic weapons production is not on par with that of the West or Russia, and Kyiv has relied on the West to provide the necessary armaments to stave off Russian forces.\n\nThe U.S. alone has provided Ukraine with $175 billion in total aid, roughly $70 billion of which is solely military assistance, according to The Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nEven with Western aid, Ukraine has struggled to hold its ground against Russian forces in the eastern theater of the war. Russian forces have seized key locations in Eastern Ukraine, exhausting Ukrainian forces and forcing them to withdraw further west.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The U.S. first provided a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine in Dec. 2022, nearly a year after Russia's invasion.\n\nThe first shipment of such weapons due to this \"reprioritization\" will take place over the coming weeks and \"certainly\" before the end of the summer, he said.\n\nKirby declined to say which countries the move will impact but pointed out that Taiwan will not be affected in terms of what it \"continues to, to need and to receive from the United States with respect to their self defense.\" Israel, which is currently at war with Hamas in Gaza, will not be impacted either, Kirby said.\n\nThe U.S. has informed all of the countries that will be affected of the decision, Kirby said, adding that the response was \"broadly understanding of it.\"\n\n\"The broader message here to Russia is clear: if you think you're going to be able to outlast Ukraine, and if you think you're gonna be able to outlast those of us who are supporting Ukraine, you're just flat out wrong,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement came one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to North Korea for the first time in 24 years, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a pact pledging that their countries would assist one another if either faces \"aggression.\"\n\nKirby on Thursday was the move was \"no surprise,\" noting that the U.S. has been vocal about North Korea enabling Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Russia is absolutely isolated on the world stage, they've been forced to rely again on countries like North Korea and Iran,\" Kirby said. \"We're just going to

This announcement comes hot on the heels of a Financial Times report revealing plans to redirect supplies of Patriot systems and missiles initially intended for export to Ukraine.\n\nRomania's four Patriot batteries, configured in the US standard [PAC-3+], include PAC-2 GEM-T and the recently operational PAC-3 MSE missiles. The country initially ordered these batteries in 2017 without expecting any compensation. Initially, Romania sought approval to purchase seven batteries to phase out its older Kub and Volkhov systems.\n\nThe Romanian Ministry of Defense highlights that this decision hinges on allies adequately compensating for the transferred capabilities. However, the specifics of such compensation remain unclear. Recently, Germany donated a third Patriot battery to Ukraine, while the Netherlands offered components like radar and launchers, and Italy provided the SAMP/T system.\n\nEarlier in May\n\nWhen discussions arose about bolstering Ukraine's air defenses, the spotlight turned to Romania, a neighboring nation equipped with American-made Patriot systems. This intriguing development was highlighted by local journalists in May during Romanian President Klaus Iohannis' visit to the White House.\n\nDuring his official trip to the United States, President Klaus Iohannis confirmed the possibility of deploying one of Romania's own Patriot systems in Ukraine. Of the three systems currently operational in Romania, the one in active use will not be the one sent eastward to support Ukraine.\n\nRomania has acquired seven Patriot air defense systems, with four already received and the remaining three still under discussion. This acquisition, costing an impressive $4 billion, marks the most significant defense investment in Romania's history. It's important to note that Romania's operational Patriot systems come equipped with advanced hardware and software. These systems have been tested in combat and are capable of countering a wide range of modern airborne threats.\n\nPAC3+\n\nOne of the main differences between the PAC-3+ and earlier Patriot systems, like the PAC-2 and PAC-3, is the improved Missile Segment Enhancement [MSE] interceptor. This interceptor has a bigger motor and better guidance, giving it more range, speed, and agility. This makes it more effective against advanced threats, including maneuvering ballistic missiles.\n\nThe PAC-3+ system also has better radar technology. It uses the AN/MPQ-65 radar, which is more advanced than the older AN/MPQ-53 radar in earlier versions. Another upgrade in the PAC-3+ is its command and control system. It is now more robust and flexible. This system can work with other air and missile defense systems, creating a more coordinated defense network. This ability to integrate is crucial for modern military operations where different systems need to work together smoothly.\n\nIn short, the Patriot PAC-3+ air defense system is a big improvement over earlier versions. Its better interceptors, advanced radar, and improved command and control make it a strong tool in the US military's defense strategy. These upgrades help the PAC-3+ effectively counter modern threats, protecting both military and civilian targets.", "source": {"uri": "bulgarianmilitary.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bulgarian Military Industry Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "boyko_nikolov@bulgarianmilitary.com", "name": "Boyko Nikolov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MIM-104 Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artillery battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Defence_(Romania)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of National Defence (Romania)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_(missile_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aster (missile family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Romania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Romania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interceptor aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canadian-aid-56M-allocated-to-bolster-Ukrainian-air-defense.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667386", "eventUri": "eng-9667386", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

This reprioritization will come in addition to the Patriot, National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAM), and MIM-23 HAWK missiles it has already supplied to Ukraine.\n\n\"We're going to reprioritize the deliveries of these exports so that those [air-defense] missiles rolling off the production line will now be provided to Ukraine,\" Kirby said. \"This will ensure that we'll be able to provide Ukraine with the missiles they need to maintain their stockpiles at a key moment in the war.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as Russian forces have increasingly fired munitions from stand-off distances, including from the relative safety of their own borders, that have then flown into Ukrainian territory. Many of these strikes have targeted power plants and other critical infrastructure components.\n\n\"The broader message here to Russia is clear. If you think you're gonna be able to outlast Ukraine and if you think you're gonna be able to outlast those of us who are supporting Ukraine, you're just flat-out wrong,\" Kirby insisted. \"We're going to make sure that we give Ukraine the critical air defense capabilities they need now and into the future.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has already given Ukraine some blessing to begin using U.S.-donated weapons to intercept Russian long-range munitions and hit other key targets on the Russian side of the Ukraine-Russia border.\n\nKirby said U.S. support for Israeli and Taiwanese air defense systems would not be impacted by this reprioritization.\n\nHe did not say how many other countries waiting in line for deliveries of air defense systems will be impacted by this reprioritization, but said the plan is to focus on supplying these systems to Ukraine for the remainder of 2024 and all of 2025.\n\n\"So about 16 months will be the focus of the timeframe to fill out Ukraine's inventory, and then after that the countries that have been asked to delay will start to get their deliveries,\" Kirby said.\n\nWhile the Biden administration and Ukraine's other backers have been flowing tens of billions in military aid their way for more than two years, Russia has appeared to augment its own domestic weapons production with some support from partners like Iran and North Korea. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea this week, signing a new bilateral security partnership.\n\nKirby insisted that Russia is feeling increasingly isolated as its military campaign in Ukraine winds on in its third year, and that Putin's visit to North Korea only further proved that sense of Russian isolation.\n\n\"They don't have a lot of friends in the world.

Thanks for joining us. Hope everyone was able to take some time off yesterday, if you were, and relax.\n\nKirby has a few words here at the top, and then as always, we'll get through as many questions as we can.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Good morning, everybody. What I want to talk about today is Ukraine and our efforts to meet their critical air defense capabilities, their needs.\n\nFor more than two years, at the President's direction, we have prioritized strengthening Ukraine's air defenses to help protect the Ukrainian people against Russia's aerial attacks. But in recent months, Russia has accelerated both its missile and its drone attacks against cities and civilian infrastructure. They are trying to destroy Ukraine's energy system ahead of this winter. Again, this is not a new tactic for them, but they have certainly applied a lot more energy and effort into it in recent months.\n\nAs we've heard from President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian military is in desperate need of additional air defense capabilities. We take our partnership seriously, especially when a partner like Ukraine is in such jeopardy. Right now, we know that Ukraine urgently needs these additional capabilities.\n\nWe have continued to dig deep and provide Ukraine with a variety of air defense systems and interceptor missiles from our own stockpiles, including those of the Patriot system, NASAMs, and of course, the Hawks.\n\nMany of our allies and partners have stepped up in historic ways as well. But obviously, more is needed, and it's needed now. So as a result, the United States government has made the difficult but necessary decision to reprioritize, near term, planned deliveries of foreign military sales to other countries of particularly Patriot and NASAM missiles to go to Ukraine instead.\n\nSo let me just take a moment to explain what this means.\n\nAs you know, the United States has a robust foreign military sales program where our defense industrial base produces and then exports material to other countries, including, of course, air defense missiles. And what we're going to do is we're going to reprioritize the deliveries of these exports so that those missiles rolling off the production line will now be provided to Ukraine. This will ensure that we'll be able to provide Ukraine with the missiles they need to maintain their stockpiles at a key moment in the war and as we get, again, towards the end of summer and into the fall.\n\nAs a result, deliveries of these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed. To be clear, those countries will still receive the missiles that they have ordered. It's just that the delivery timelines will now take a little longer.\n\nWe have, of course, informed all the affected countries that we are taking this extraordinary step. And we're making every effort to minimize any negative impact to countries with affected foreign military sales cases. If any of our other partners were ever in a situation similar to Ukraine's, we would go to extraordinary lengths to support their security as well.\n\nThis decision demonstrates our commitment to supporting our partners when they're in existential danger. The United States firmly believes that this is the best course of action right now to support Ukraine, while still ensuring other partners receive the air defense missiles and capabilities that they've committed to purchase, again, on a delayed timeline.\n\nLook, the broader message here to Russia is clear: If you think you're going to be able to outlast Ukraine and if you think you're going to be able to outlast those of us who are supporting Ukraine, you're just flat-out wrong. And we're going to make sure that we give Ukraine the critical air defense capabilities they need now and into the future. And we're going to keep working with our allies and partners to make sure that they too get the air defense capabilities that they ordered. And we're grateful to the nations that we've reached out to and have not only understood but many of them have been fully supportive of this decision.\n\nSo with that, we can start taking some questions.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our first question will go to Steve Holland with Reuters.\n\nQ Thank you. Along those lines, could you talk about what are the ramifications for the United States of the defense pact signed by Putin and Kim Jong Un over the last couple days?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Steve, I did not hear that question. Can you repeat it? I'm sorry.\n\nQ The ramifications of the defense pact that Russia and North Korea signed in the last couple of days.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, look, I talked about this the other day, you know, but I'm happy to revisit it here now that they've made public the text of this agreement.\n\nNumber one, no surprise here, Steve. We've been talking about this and warning about a burgeoning defense relationship between these two countries now for many months, through a series of downgraded intelligence that we put out there.\n\nSo we've been sharing information publicly about how the DPRK has been enabling Russia's war in Ukraine and about their weapons transfers. Obviously, it's something that we've taken seriously. If we didn't take it seriously, my goodness, we wouldn't have made it public and wouldn't have been talking about it for quite some time.\n\nNumber two -- and I think this should be fairly obvious too -- when you look at the body of work President Biden has directed the national security team to do, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, we have been strengthening and bolstering our allies, our alliances, and our partnerships all throughout that region throughout the entire three and a half years of this administration, including through the historic trilateral agreement between the Republic of Korea and Japan and the United States, including through the AUKUS initiative, including by expanding our access and cooperation with the Philippines. And of course, we're going to continue to evaluate our posture throughout the Indo-Pacific as needed.\n\nBut we have prioritized this part of the world since the beginning of this administration. And that work, that effort, we believe, has right now and will continue to put us in the best possible position to be able to thwart any threats and challenges, not just on the Korean Peninsula but elsewhere in the region.\n\nQ And if you --\n\nMR. KIRBY: But wait, just a couple more points, if I could.\n\nThat's not to say that this development, this agreement is not a concern. Of course, it is. It should be a concern to any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability, not just on the Korean Peninsula but in the Indo-Pacific. It should be a concern to any country that believes that the U.N. Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by. It should be a concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do.\n\nAnd we would think that that concern would be shared by the People's Republic of China, since this agreement also seems to be in direct contrast with the statement that President Putin and President Xi made in Beijing just a month ago in which both countries called for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nNow, last thing I'll say here, Steve, and then I'm happy to take any follow-ups you have, is: Our view is that this agreement is also a sign of Russia's desperation. I mean, they're reaching out to North Korea for missiles, reaching -- they're still getting drones from Iran. They don't have a lot of friends in the world, and they're trying to do everything they can to pull on the strings of the friends that they do have.\n\nRussia is absolutely isolated on the world stage. They've been forced to rely, again, on countries like North Korea and Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, split-screen, if you will, Ukraine just organized a successful peace summit in Switzerland that had more than 100 countries and organizations sign up to support President Zelenskyy's vision for a just peace.\n\nSo, last thing I'll say, and then I promise I'll shut up on this: We're just going to keep supporting Ukraine as they defend themselves from Russia. And we're obviously going to keep looking for opportunities to strengthen, deepen, and bolster our strong and vast network of alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nSo, sorry, that was a long one. But go ahead, Steve. You have a follow-up?\n\nQ Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. Mike Turner is giving a speech, saying that the Biden administration isn't taking the threat seriously enough of Russia's space-based nukes. What's your response to that?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, he's just wrong. He's just flat-out wrong.\n\nLook, we have absolutely taken this very seriously. We've been working this particular problem set from every possible angle, including through intense diplomacy with countries around the world and, obviously, through direct conversations with Russia. We've been working hard to get other countries to join us in making clear what the dangers are of an anti-satellite weapon that's designed to carry a nuclear weapon, just like the one that Chairman Turner is referencing. And we put forth a resolution at the U.N. Security Council to do that just about a month or so ago.\n\nAs we said at the time, in February, when this was made public, publicizing this highly sensitive intelligence was highly irresponsible, and it was something that the intelligence community themselves had serious concerns with. And we had assessed that starting with private engagement, rather than immediately publicizing the intelligence, would have been a much more effective approach. So, obviously, as we said at the time, and we still are, disappointed that that opportunity was prevented by Chairman Turner's letter and then, thus, making it public.\n\nNevertheless, what I can say is: We're going to continue our efforts to dissuade Russia from putting a nuclear weapon into orbit. We're going to do everything possible to prevent that outcome. This is a national security issue. And quite frankly, it's not something that anyone should be playing politics one way or the other.\n\nAll nations, all individuals, anybody in public service, particularly here in this country, ought to be similarly concerned about the manner in which we talk about this and the approach that we take to try to stymie the Russian plans.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Jordan with Bloomberg.\n\nQ Thanks, Kirby. Two questions for you. First, on the Patriot missiles, can you tell us a timeframe of when the countries that will have their deliveries delayed, when they'll be able to get them? Are we talking weeks, months, years?\n\nAnd secondly, wondering if the administration is aware of a pair of major cyberattacks on a software company used by auto retailers and whether there's been any determination if that's been carried out by a foreign actor and if there's any assessment of how that will affect the economy.\n\nMR. KIRBY: So, on your first question, what I can tell you is that we expect the first shipments from this reprioritization of air defense missiles to Ukraine will happen over coming weeks. Certainly before the end of the summer, Ukraine will start to see the initial deliveries of these.\n\nI can't say with specificity what the delay is going to be like for every country that is affected by this, because these are individual contracts. And as we have communicated to these countries and will continue to do so, we'll do the best we can to minimize their delay as much as possible. But each country is going to have a different set of circumstances applied to that based on how much they've ordered and, you know, what their own self-defense needs are.\n\nBut I also would just add that the scope of the deliveries that were given to Ukraine will span -- will provide them enough capabilities over the rest of this fiscal year and, of course, all next fiscal year. So about 16 months will be the focus of the timeframe to fill out Ukraine's inventory. And then, after that, the countries that have been asked to delay will start to get their deliveries.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question --\n\nMR. KIRBY: Oh, wait a minute, before you go to the next question.\n\nYou asked -- I don't have a good answer for you on the reports of a cyberattack on the auto industry. I'm going to take that question, and we'll see if we can get something a little bit better for you.\n\nQ Thank you. Our next question will go to Arlette with CNN.\n\nQ Hi, thank you. I have just two areas I want to touch on. Still on the Ukraine air defense capabilities: Do you have an idea of how many countries will be impacted by this?\n\nAnd then, if I could also ask about Israel: How frustrated has the President been about Netanyahu's comments claiming that the U.S. was withholding some military aid for Israel? And what do you think Netanyahu's motivation was in making such a claim? And are there any plans -- or where do things stand -- plans for POTUS to meet with Netanyahu when he comes to Washington in July?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Okay, there's an awful lot there.\n\nLook, on the number of countries, I would just say it's a range of countries. But I think we're going to respect each country's prerogative to either acknowledge it and speak to it or not.\n\nI would tell you -- you didn't ask this, but just to make it clear that this reprioritization will not affect Taiwan and what Taiwan continues to need and to receive from the United States with respect to their self-defense.\n\nLook, on the Prime Minister's comments -- and I assume you mean the video that he put out, claiming that, you know, it was unconscionable for the United States to withhold assistance -- I would just -- a couple of points here.\n\nNumber one, obviously, we didn't know that video was common. And it was perplexing to say the least, certainly disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas -- and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region -- than the United States. I mean, my goodness, this President put U.S. fighter aircraft up in the air, in the middle of April, to help shoot down several hundred drones and missiles, including ballistic missiles that were fired from Iran proper into Israel. There's no other country that has done more or will continue to do more than the United States to help Israel defend itself.\n\nSo those comments were deeply disappointing and certainly vexing to us, given the amount of support that we have and will continue to provide Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nAnd I think you had, like, several other follow-ups on that. And I think I --\n\nQ Well, what do you think his motivation was behind making such a comment?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I --\n\nQ (Inaudible) domestic audience at home, or is he genuinely concerned about some missing aid that they haven't gotten?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No idea. You'd have to talk to the Prime Minister about what prompted him to do that. Again, it was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Gordon with Wall Street Journal.\n\nQ My question was asked. I'm good. Thanks.\n\nMODERATOR: Okay. Thank you. Our next question will go to Nick with PBS.\n\nNick, you should be able -- there we go.\n\nQ Yeah, sorry, Sam. Thanks, John. I think I know the answer to this, but just making sure: Does any air defense system in Israel -- is that affected by today's announcement?\n\nAnd then, to go back to some statements from Israel: In the last 24 hours, what has been a private -- or reasonably private, I suppose -- dispute between the leaders of the IDF and the Prime Minister has exploded into public. Do you think that what is now a public dispute between the leaders of the IDF and the Prime Minister threatens U.S. goals when it comes to Gaza and the region and the overall war in Gaza? Thanks, John.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thanks, Nick. So, on your first question: No, there's no -- there's going to be no impact felt by Israel as a result of this reprioritization.\n\nOn your second question, I think it would be imprudent, at best, for us to speak about any intragovernmental tensions in Israel right now, except to say -- I think in answer to your question -- we do not believe that there's going to be any -- certainly any change to our objectives or our goals. And we don't see any impact of these tensions on our shared objective: getting all the hostages out, getting this deal in place, getting a ceasefire in place, and trying to find a way to end this war.\n\nBut beyond that, I'd let the parties speak to it.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Aurelia with AFP.\n\nQ Hi, John. Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up maybe. On the Middle East: Can you confirm that Jake Sullivan is meeting today with the Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer? And what would be the agenda for that meeting?\n\nAnd another question, if I may, on Darfur. One week ago, the United Nations Security Council demanded an end to the siege of the city of Al-Fashir. Since then, have you seen any sign that the fighting is calming down? And if not, what's the administration doing to try to prevent, like, a major humanitarian catastrophe there?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I'm going to take your question on Darfur, Aurelia, and get back to you, rather than try to explain something that may just make me sound stupid. So I don't want to do that. I want to do that right and take the question for you.\n\nOn your first question: Yes, Jake will be meeting today with his counterpart, Ha- -- Hagnebi [sic], and -- I'm sorry about that -- and Mr. Dermer. And it'll be a wide-ranging discussion, I think you can imagine, about everything that's going on with the Gaza war, with our support to Israel, with our efforts to get a better sense of how they're continuing to prosecute operations against Hamas, as well as continuing to talk about the importance of closing on this deal.\n\nSorry, I blanked on his last name. It's Hanegbi. Hanegbi.\n\nAnyway, that's the focus of that meeting today.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Haley with Scripps.\n\nQ Thank you. I'm curious, on the line of the hostage ceasefire talks, if there have been any additional developments or if you've heard back from Hamas additionally this week.\n\nAnd then, when it comes to the supply of Patriots to Ukraine, I mean, I know -- I'm guessing you're probably not going to put a specific number on this, but what impact do you expect this to make quantitatively for them when it comes to the numbers they're asking for?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I can tell you, on the Patriots, it's in the realm of hundreds that we're talking about, as I said, over the course of the rest of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year, the entire fiscal year for '25. So in the realm of the hundreds.\n\nI don't have an update for you on the progress on the ceasefire deal. Again, it's our understanding that Hamas -- I'm sorry, that Qatar and Egypt are still talking to their interlocutors with Hamas and trying to see if they can close whatever gaps exist. And we're still hopeful and still watching this very, very closely.\n\nAnd just to remind: As I said in my opening statement, it is in the realm of the hundreds, and it's both Patriot interceptor missiles and NASAM interceptor missiles. Both programs.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Keleigh with NewsNation.\n\nQ Hey, John. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the tensions between Hezbollah and Israel and the concerns of a wider war. I know something you've spoken about and the administration has spoken out about not wanting to see this grow into a wider war.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IDF approved operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon. Since that approval, what discussions have the U.S. had to try to deescalate the situation?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, as you know, our envoy, Amos Hochstein, has been in the region the last few days, shuttling back and forth between Tel Aviv and Beirut to have these exact conversations.\n\nI won't speak to IDF military planning; they need to do that. I would just tell you that we still don't want to see a second front opened up. Obviously, we take the tensions and the rhetoric seriously by both sides. And we're doing everything we can to try to prevent that outcome. And those conversations are ongoing, literally as we speak.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Anita with VOA.\n\nQ Thank you so much, John. Going back to Putin and his travels in Asia: He's headed to Hanoi. Is there any indication, that you are aware of, that he seeks material support from Vietnam for the Ukraine war?\n\nAnd then secondly, with the top State Department official headed to Hanoi as well this week, is the U.S. seeking a debrief from Hanoi on Putin's visit?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, obviously, we have an embassy there, and they'll certainly have, in due course, appropriate conversations with their counterparts in the Vietnamese government.\n\nBut, look, I would just say, broadly speaking, our expectation is that Vietnam will continue to adhere to its commitment to, and its commitment and support for, the basic principles of the U.N. Charter, which include sovereignty, which include territorial integrity, and that they'll continue, as they have, to convey that these principles need to be upheld all across the world -- in Europe, as well as in Asia.\n\nI'll let the two countries speak for themselves about the particulars of this visit and whatever they might agree to coming out of it. But I think it's -- I would remind you that that we, the United States, President Biden, elevated our bilateral relationship with Vietnam to a historic level, basically upgrading it to a comprehensive strategic partnership. And that's a partnership that we believe reflects well the strength of that bilateral relationship. And we're going to stay focused on continuing to deepen it, broaden it, improve it for our own mutual benefit to each other and to the region.\n\nWe're focused on this bilateral relationship in ways that we don't believe anybody else really is, and we're going to stay focused on that.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Yuna with Channel 12.\n\nQ Hi, Kirby. Hi, Sam. Thank you for doing this. First, to follow up about a question I don't think was answered. Is there a plan for a meeting between the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu during his speech in Congress?\n\nAnd the second thing is: After the video by Netanyahu, was there any talks behind the scenes? I know that he met Special Envoy Amos Hochstein, but was there any attempt to scale it down a little bit? Any apology coming from Israel?\n\nMR. KIRBY: So, on your first question, I don't have anything on the President's schedule to speak to.\n\nOn your second question, I think we've made it abundantly clear to our Israeli counterparts, through various vehicles, our deep disappointment in the statements expressed in that video and our concerns over the accuracy in the statements made.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Nathan with KAN.\n\nQ Thanks so much for taking my question. Going back to the issue of arms shipments to Israel, could you give us an update on the status of these 2,000-pound bomb shipments?\n\nAnd is there anything to add about the shipment itself or advancing the deal of the F-15 fighters to Israel? Has that been approved, and will that go ahead?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I'm going to let the State Department speak to the F-15 question; that's really more in their lane. I will just tell you a couple of things.\n\nNumber one, as I said earlier, material assistance to Israel and their ability to defend themselves has continued -- has continued to flow, even though there had been a pause put on those 2,000-pound bombs. I don't have an update for you on that one way or the other. But the idea that we had somehow stopped helping Israel with their self-defense needs is actually just not accurate.\n\nOn the F-15s, the only other thing I'd add is that these would be slated to be delivered in, like, 2029, if they're approved. And that approval process is ongoing, not related at all to the current conflict. But again, I'd point you over to the State Department to talk about that in a little bit more in detail.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Neria with Israel 13.\n\nQ Hey, Kirby. Thank you so much for doing this. After hearing Netanyahu's remarks, we've heard really tough comments by the White House, and also, we're hearing you now saying that it was very disappointing. Did you try to tell -- to say anything to Israeli officials about it? Are you about to say today in your official meetings with Sullivan and senior officials in Israel?\n\nMR. KIRBY: As I said earlier, I think to a question a few minutes ago, we've made it clear at various levels, through various vehicles, our concerns over the content of that video.\n\nQ And why do you think that he did that? Why do you think that he put that video out there? Do you have an assumption?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No idea. You'd have to talk to the Prime Minister's office.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will go to Morgan with Semafor.\n\nQ Hey, John. Thanks so much for doing this. Just one follow-up on the decision to reprioritize the air defense capabilities to Ukraine. You mentioned you notified other countries will be affected. What kind of reaction did you get? I mean, were they understanding? Was there a level of concern there?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I think I could describe it as broadly understanding of it.\n\nQ Thank you. And I think we have time for one more question. We'll go to Marek with Polskie Radio.\n\nQ Thank you, Sam. Hi, John. On missiles: You said that Taiwan and Israel won't be affected. What about countries on the eastern NATO flank, close to Russia and Ukraine? Are those countries excluded? If not, why? There were cases when Russian missiles flew over Poland during Russian attacks on western Ukraine.\n\nAnd my second question: Are you also considering putting on hold or redirecting deliveries of Patriot and NASAM systems itself, including launchers and radars?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, so to your first question, as I said earlier, we'll let the countries affected speak for themselves on this. As I said, the response we got was broadly supportive. And many of the countries that we talked to were, in fact, very supportive of this because they know how serious the need is in Ukraine.\n\nAs for the actual amount, this is about -- just to be clear, this decision is about reprioritizing the deliveries of missiles, the actual interceptor missiles. We did take a look at the broader system writ large -- the launchers, the radar systems, all that go with that -- and I think we'd be open to it. But the way that FMS is -- foreign military sales program -- is structured, right now we just don't have eligible systems coming off the production line. So it was something we looked at, but right now the focus is really going to be on the missiles themselves.\n\nQ Can I take it as a confirmation that eastern NATO flank countries are not excluded from the hold?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Again, I'll let other countries speak for themselves. As I said, we spoke to a number of countries about this, and I don't think we're going to identify them here today. We'll let those countries speak for themselves. I mean, we're talking about air defense capabilities here. And some countries will likely be more willing to talk about their participation in this effort than others, and they should speak for themselves. So I'm just not going to get into that.\n\nBut I do want to go back, if I could, just on your question about systems. One thing I forgot to mention was: Separate and distinct from this effort -- and as I said, we're open to continue to look at the possibility of systems themselves being redirected. But even before this decision, we had been working closely with other countries, in Europe and beyond Europe, that have systems -- launchers, radar systems, and support systems -- about their willingness to contribute those systems to Ukraine's air defense capabilities. And so, that effort is ongoing; I would even describe it as a parallel effort. And we're going to continue to do that going forward.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for joining. As always, if we weren't able to get to you, reach out to the NSC press distro, and we'll try to get back to you as soon as we can.

The goal is to provide them with enough equipment to last the next 16 months.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked President Joe Biden on X, saying the aid \"will protect Ukrainian cities and civilians.\"\n\n\"The partnership between Ukraine and the United States is strong and unwavering.

Patriots are the most expensive interceptor in the American arsenal, with the system carrying a $1 billion price tag, while each interceptor runs the US taxpayer $4 million.\n\nAlthough Washington has urged Kiev to curtail attacks on Russian energy infrastructure to avoid Moscow's retaliation in kind, Ukraine continues to strike its neighbor's oil refineries. On Wednesday, a Ukrainian defense official said Kiev had successfully set fire to an oil facility in southern Russia during a drone raid.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news",

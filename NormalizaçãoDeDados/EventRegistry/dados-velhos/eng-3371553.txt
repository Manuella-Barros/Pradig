area, after the incident at 11pm on Wednesday which saw a house in the street peppered with bullets.\n\nArmed officers were sent to the scene and neighbours described seeing two men make off on a motorbike soon after shots were heard.\n\nAt one point during the following investigations, at 2.45pm, five officers were seen scrutinizing the garden of one property in Horden Road, which runs off Hylton Road.\n\nAll wearing gloves, the team were slowly looking through the grass and underneath the trampoline which was in the garden.\n\nChildren from the area were also looking on.\n\nA passerby said: \"A number of officers were carrying out fingertip searches of the area around where that shooting happened.\n\n\"They were walking really slowly across the grass of gardens in the area

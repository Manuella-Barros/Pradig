top-selling band of all time delivered another amazing show for hometown fans during Day Two (Saturday, Aug. 12) of the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.\n\nIt was almost as good as the band's 2012 Outside Lands appearance, which may just be the best headliner set in the festival's 10-year history.\n\nThe band sounded as mighty and muscular as ever as it rolled through a two-hour-plus set that featured both classics from the back catalog and soon-to-be-classics from the latest Metallica offering, last year's entirely worthy \"Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct.\"\n\nAnd the whole shebang was punctuated with a big fireworks show, which came during an encore highlighted by \"Nothing Else Matters\" and, of course, the usual \"Enter Sandman\" closer.\n\nThe band's triumphant homecoming, after a long summer of playing stadium shows around North America, closed Day Two in excellent fashion, helping fans forget about the disappointing news that A Tribe Called Quest had canceled its Outside Lands appearance.\n\nAgain.\n\nYes, you might recall that acclaimed hip-hop act was a no-show for its scheduled appearance on Day One (Friday, Aug. 11) of Outside Lands, forcing promoters to push back Tribe's set by a day.\n\nThen Day Two rolled around and the Tribe canceled on the rescheduled date as well.\n\n1) We are deeply disappointed that we've just been informed A Tribe Called Quest will not make their scheduled performance at Outside Lands.\n\n-- Outside Lands Help (@outsidelands411) August 13, 2017\n\nThe news quickly spread through the festival grounds, causing many hip-hop fans to groan, perhaps in realization that, yes, they now might have to watch the Avett Brothers instead.\n\n(I'm just goofing around with that Avett comment - the band is actually fine in concert.)\n\nFestival officials later released a statement on the cancellation.\n\n\"Due to further travel complications, A Tribe Called Quest could not make their re-scheduled festival performance,\" the statement read. \"Outside Lands has done everything in our power to accommodate these unfortunate circumstances and we deeply regret the disappointment this has caused our fans.\"\n\nMany took to Twitter, of course, to voice their complaints to the festival.\n\nYet, I'm not sure what else the promoters could've done. They already bent over backwards once to try and make the performance happen, juggling bands between stages in order to reschedule Tribe.\n\nIt was just one of those unfortunate situations. But it was quickly followed by a big batch of good fortune, as Metallica returned to again rock Outside Lands.", "time": "05:00:00"}

of Day Two\n\nDay two of Outside Lands proved to be disappointing for fans of A Tribe Quest who ended up being a no show at their rescheduled 7:00 pm slotted time.\n\nFans were aggravated to get the news, less than thirty minutes before the set-time. Outside Lands sent out an alert via the official festival app, as well as their Twitter feed. Some fans however, were still not aware of the news until Los Angeles-based DJ Claude VonStroke showed up to fill the time slot at the Twin Peaks stage.\n\nOn the other hand, day two of the festival was an extremely satisfactory day for the masses who showed up to see Metallica.\n\nThere were several remarkable moments throughout the day, Cage The Elephant, who were filling in for Queens of The Stone stage at Lands End (the main stage) mesmerized crowd.\n\nFrontman Matthew Shultz, paraded around the stage shirtless, and with an impressive stage presence. The band's eclectic sound dominated. Equally impressive was how in tune the band members were with one another, as they had little prep time to get ready for this performance at Outside Lands.\n\nOver at the Sutro stage, two performances blew festival-goers away: Vance Joy and The Avett Brothers.\n\nAustralian singer-songwriter Vance Joy played back-to-back sold out shows at the Fox Theater in Oakland just last year, and based on the amount of people who congregated at Sutro Stage to catch his performance, he might just have to come back and play the Bay soon. Joy made his Outside Lands debut back in 2014 when he played the much smaller Twin Peaks stage.\n\nThe Avett Brothers also played at the Sutro stage, and one of the most memorable moments of their set was their tribute to the late Chris Cornell with their rendition of \"Black Hole Sun.\"\n\nThe night, of course, belonged to Metallica, who despite the chilly weather (colder than Friday night) kept everyone warm not only with a magnificent setlist, but also a pyrotechnic display of fireworks and spitting fire from both sides of the stage.\n\nMetallica could have easily played a three-hour show if it wasn't for the strict curfew at Golden Gate Park. The band blazed through their massive music catalog where classics like \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Master of Puppets\" were part of the night's selection.\n\nThe Bay Area natives were sure to cement their name as rock legends, thirty-six years and counting.\n\nDay three of Outside Lands Tenth Anniversary wraps tomorrow with quite an eclectic line-up including, Oakland's own Kamaiyah, Bleachers, K-Flay, Solange, the much anticipated return of Lorde who will be playing tracks from her new album, and of course, headliners The Who.", "time": "16:42:00"}

We all welcomed festival mascot, Ranger Dave, as this year marked the 10th Anniversary of the festival and it deserved some celebration. Some surprises were unplanned and due to unforseen circumstances, but the performances put on by this year's artists blew the festival-goer's expectations way out of the water.\n\nNot even a mile from the Pacific Ocean, the Golden Gate Park makes for the perfect backdrop for the three-day music and arts festival. An estimated 70,000 people trickled in throughout the day and seemingly all ended up at Gorillaz's set, who headlined at Lands End stage at the end of the night.\n\nWith green smoke oozing from the background of Lands End, they opened with \"M1A1,\" from their debut self-titled album Gorillaz. Promptly after the first song, Damon Albarnz ran over to the railing that seperated him and the crowd and stood in it to clap his hands while a security guard stood behind him and steadily held him up. Over the course of their two hour performance, they continued to bring out one surprise guest after the other, with a large portion of them from The Gorillaz' 2017 album Humanz. Surprise features included Kali Uchis for \"Shes My Collar,\" Pusha-T for \"Let Me Out,\" De La Soul for \"Momentz,\" and a seriously hyped up performance of \"Feel Good Inc.\" Yukimi Nagano from Little Dragon took the stage and sang \"Empire Ants,\" Anthony Hamilton for \"Carnival,\" and Jamie Principle and Zebra Katz for \"Sex Murder Party.\" The crowd and artists on stage were vibe-ing so hard, after performing \"19-2000,\" Damon Albarnz screamed, \"That was too fun we're gunna do that again,\" and continued to give an equally as energetic encore the crowd went crazy for.\n\nThe production of their set without-a-doubt had some influence in the madness that unfolded at Lands End, with colorful and sporadic lights that illuminated the stage and short clips of the animated characters we've come to know and love playing in the background. Towards the end of their performance, the Golden Gate Bridge that decorated the top of the main stage shined four skylights on each end, and lit up San Francisco.\n\nWhile some surprises were definitely planned out during rehearsal, others came up just hours before the set was scheduled to start. Major rap group A Tribe Called Quest was supposed to perform on Friday, but had to reschedule due to unforseen travel issues. Their new time is on Saturday night in between Metallica and Foxygen.\n\nAnother big name on the Outside Lands Friday lineup included the dreamy indie folk band Fleet Foxes. Before walking on the Sutro stage, four men playing trumpets lined up side by side and played for the audience. After a minute, the members of Fleet Foxes walked onto stage and opened with \"Cassius,\" using different instruments such as the flute, piano, and guitar to make for an incredible sounding production. The sound was incredibly crisp, and filled the small valley that surrounded the tapestry decorated Sutro stage.\n\nIn between songs, Father John Misty took a moment to stop and thank the crowd for going to watch them. He then dubbed San Francisco as \"one of the top cities in the world,\" which prompted an enthusiastic cheer from the audience. Fleet Foxes then began to perform \"Ragged Wood,\" which sounded just as good or arguably even better in a live setting. Other songs on the setlist included fan favorites \"Your Protector,\" \"He doesn't Know Why,\" and \"White Winter Hymnal\" from their self titled album Fleet Foxes. From their newest album Crack-Up, Fleet Foxes played \"Third of May/Odaigahara,\" and \"If You Need To, Keep Time On Me.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, noise pop duo Sleigh Bells performed on the Twin Peaks stage near the rear of the festival grounds. On both sides of the stage was a picture of an old woman, one named Marian and one Vivian, symbolizing the mountains that surround San Francisco. Guitarist Derek Edward Miller and lead singer Alexis Krauss had incredible stage presence, and interacted with the audience constantly. Krauss couldn't stop thanking them for their rowdiness and stopped one time to point out a dude wearing an \"Old School Sleigh Bells Shirt.\" They performed \"Just Us Now\" from their newest album Jessica Rabbit and \"Infinity Guitars\" and \"Crown on the Ground\" from their 2010 album, Treats. After turning red in the face from jumping and running around so much on stage, Krauss encouraged the audience to keep up their energy and they didn't let her down. Once \"Riot Rhythm\" started playing, the entire crowd started making so much noise, the next stage over could hear the commotion. At the end of their performance, Sleigh Bells named Outside Lands \"One of the best festivals played in so long.\"\n\nTove Lo was an additional performer who had an infectious and erotic energy throughout her entire performance, playing at the main stage Lands End on Friday evening. She started off her set by running onto the stage and immediately playing \"True Disaster\" from her most recent album, Lady Wood. After playing fan favorite, \"Talking Body,\" Tove Lo faced the crowd and gave a short strip tease with her top before flashing her encouraging audience. She wasn't quite down with the shock factor, however, and started to throw out merch to all the people who were near the front. If you went to her set not knowing who she was, you would've walked away with her already added to her Spotify.\n\nDr. Octagon, the freaky alien gynecologist persona of Kool Keith announced that he was back this weekend and proved it in a big way after killing his set at Outside Lands on the Lands End stage on Friday afternoon. His entire crew came out in surgical masks and white lab coats, creating the aesthetic of a creepy doctor. Dr. Octagon added to the feeling when he walked up with blood splattered on his white coat and hands. He performed his hit songs \"3000,\" \"Blue Flowers,\" and \"Earth People,\" from his solo debut album Dr. Octagonecologyst, the first album under the alias of Dr. Octagon.\n\nOn stage with him was talented producer, Dan the Automator, and he told fans how he wanted to work with Kool Keith to do Dr. Octagon back in the '90s. Dan the Automator also announced, \"We went on a little Hiatus but we're back,\" and fans went crazy knowing the upcoming album was on its way. He then took a moment to recognize DJ Cubert who was working the turn tables on stage with them, and called him \"the greatest scratcher alive.\" DJ Cubert proved to the Outside Lands audience why he holds the honor of that nickname, and scratched for a solid few minutes with the camera focused on his quick moving hands the entire time.\n\nDel the Funky Homosapien also made an appearance on stage during the set, and was given a warm welcome when Dan the Automator proclaimed his friend from \"3010 should do a song with the alien from 3000.\" They continued to perform jacked up performances \"I'm Back\" and their last song was \"I'm Destructive.\" Before they made their final exit, Dr. Octogon plugged one last promo and hyped up anticipated fans up with one short phrase; \"New album coming, watch for Pussy Hot!\" The only thing missing was the mic drop.", "time": "03:48:00"}

From newcomers like K.Flay and Joywave, to veterans like Rivers Cuomo of Weezer -- who Anjos calls \"a pro, he knows what he's doing.\" But Anjos also flexed his producing muscle with other projects outside of R.A.C., including Linkin Park's newest album, One More Light.\n\nWhile Anjos never worked directly with the late Chester Bennington, he still felt that loss. \"They're so tight -- I don't know. I was sad, just like everyone else about it.\"\n\nWatch the complete rundown of what R.A.C. had to say at this year's Outside Lands in the video above.", "time": "17:38:00"}

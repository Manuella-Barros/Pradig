{"id": 243245638, "title": "Government is cutting funding for food banks", "text": "Unless the Government funds food security in the budget, Auckland City Mission \u2013 Te T\u0101pui Atawhai will have to turn families in greatest need of food away. The government has indicated that in the 2024/25 budget there will be very little funding for provision for food, even after a direct appeal from Auckland City Missioner \u2013 Manutaki, Helen Robinson. The only funding that has been confirmed is 3.5% of the Mission\u2019s total spend towards food parcel provision. Since the onset of COVID, the Mission and other agencies had received support for food, although at a declining rate since 2020. Now the Mission, and other social agencies, face the prospect of significantly reduced food services resulting in many individuals and families not getting the nourishment they need or deserve. \u201cWithout the support of government, at the Mission we will have to drastically reduce the amount of food we can give families in need from 50,000 food parcels to 20,000 food parcels annually. That is a reduction of over 50% from 1 July of this year,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThis lack of appropriate Government investment will result in immediate hardship for families already struggling in tough times. We are facing the dire reality of providing 27,000 fewer meals every week for parents and children who will not have enough food to stay physically and mentally well, not enough to go to school or to work, not enough to contribute well to society. It\u2019s a deeply upsetting and concerning prospect.\u201d", "summary": "Are things back on track? How about for those who can least afford to feed themselves?

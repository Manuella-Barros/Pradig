The title's nod to the fairytale is actually a reference to the glass coffins -- \"let's be more upbeat and call them cases,\" quips curator Andrew Bolton -- that hold 16 aging garments now so fragile that they can't be shown upright. These delicate creatures have been slumbering, like Aurora herself, in the museum's climate-controlled archives.But these \"beauties\" are only a small fraction of the 220 items on display in the nature-themed \"Sleeping Beauties,\" which Bolton calls one of the institute's most ambitious shows yet (his previous blockbusters include \"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\" and \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"). It's also special to Bolton because every item on display is from the museum's own collection.Another key difference: This show will be a multisensory experience, involving not just sight but smell, sound and touch. Organized into themes of earth, air and water, the show makes use of a \"smell artist\" who extracted and analyzed molecules from clothing, creating scents visitors can now sniff from plastic tubes. Curators have also captured sounds of fabrics in an echo-free chamber, and used 3D scans to replicate embroidery patterns for touching.Despite the scale, \"I really wanted to make this intimate and participatory,\" Bolton said during a weekend tour through the show. In fact, there's even a mannequin in a gown you can text a question to, and she'll deliver a ChatGPT-enabled response.A few highlights:Straight from 'The Gilded Age' A late 19th-century, satin-and-chiffon ballgown begins the show, its intricate embroidery of metallic threads, golden beads and sequins evoking sunbeams radiating from clouds. But the \"cloud dress\" by influential English designer Charles Frederick Worth is doomed, due to deterioration of the vertical threads -- \"there's nothing we can do about it,\" Bolton says. Except perhaps to recreate it digitally: On a screen nearby, an animated \"Pepper's ghost\" illusion that took nine months to perfect shows the gown dancing at a ball. The gown was donated by relatives of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, played on HBO's \"The Gilded Age\" by Donna Murphy.The sounds of 'scroop' A trio of gowns from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries explores the look of \"blurred blossoms\" -- the effect that makes a dress look like a watercolor or an Impressionist work. But in this gallery you also hear \"scroop\" -- the sound of silk taffeta rustling (a combination of the words \"scrape\" and \"whoop\"). The sound was captured in an echo-free chamber at Binghamton University. In another gallery, you can hear the clattering of razor clam shells, captured the same way -- accompanying McQueen's dramatic \"razor clam\" dress, covered with dried and bleached shells.A Dior to adore Christian Dior was influenced by Impressionist painters, and nowhere is this more evident than in the delicate floral embroidery on the famous Miss Dior dress, here a miniature version of the original. It looks just like a chic (and strapless) bouquet of flowers, and if you're dying to touch it, there's a small, white replica in 3D printed plastic. You can also run your hands over wallpaper created to match the shape and form of the flowers in the edgy 2013 Raf Simons version of the dress in black, with flowers in leather.Speaking of embroidery In 1988, Yves Saint Laurent paid homage to Van Gogh's famous depiction of irises a hundred years earlier, with a glistening jacket celebrated for its embroidery. The museum lays it flat to give a closer view of a garment that took 600 hours of work by artisans who used 250 meters of ribbon, 200,000 beads and 250,000 paillettes (spangles) in 22 colors.Smell the roses In a show devoted to nature, it's hardly surprising to find rooms devoted to roses. And you're invited to smell them, via scents carried in plastic tubes -- not simply the smell of roses, but the smell of garments themselves and those who wore them. Bolton explains that Norwegian \"smell artist\" Sissel Tolaas brought an apparatus that extracted molecules from 57 garments. Two evening dresses, one by Saint Laurent for Dior and one by Lanvin, yielded molecules found in things like almonds and honey, tobacco and hay, and even \"a mild sex attractant for moths and cockroaches.\"Scent of a woman Yes, it was an Al Pacino movie -- but here, it's a gallery devoted to Millicent Rogers, a socialite, heiress and art collector known for her style and how she combined haute couture with regional dress. This gallery focuses on her scent, though, analyzing molecules from her garments -- like a 1938 Schiaparelli evening dress in blue silk crepe -- to discover her fragrances but also habits and lifestyle, \"including what she ate, drank and smoked.\"This coat is alive! A prime draw in the \"Garden Life\" section is a grass coat in which the wool itself has been planted, like soil, with oat, rye and wheatgrass. Right now, the design by gala honorary chair Jonathan Anderson of the label Loewe (a sponsor of the show) looks beautiful and green. But it is dying, because this version cannot be watered, and will be replaced about a week from opening with a version in a different stage of life. Also here: a slew of floral hats from the Met's copious collection. These, too, have been analyzed for smell -- eliciting scents containing hairspray, unsurprisingly, but also chewing gum, cigarettes and other things.Don't feed these birds! Bolton has said he wants to depict not just nature but shades of emotion -- including fear. Which is just what you may feel when you get to the part on flying things: insects and beetle wings, for example. Also, birds. McQueen is said to have adored Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds,\" and here we have his orange wool jacket printed with black swallows. The creepy part is the animation on the ceiling: first a few black birds, then more, then so many that the space turns an ominous black. The animation, created in consultation with wildlife experts, comprises \"14,000 digital swallows,\" ending with 4,000 simulated feathers. For sound, real swallow calls were recorded, and also the \"humming\" sound from the 1963 movie itself was captured to create tension.\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" will open to the public Friday and run through Sept. 2.\n\nSure, she was a royal princess and all.

Curators have also captured sounds of fabrics in an echo-free chamber, and used 3D scans to replicate embroidery patterns for touching.\n\nDespite the scale, \"I really wanted to make this intimate and participatory,\" Bolton said during a weekend tour through the show. In fact, there's even a mannequin in a gown you can text a question to, and she'll deliver a ChatGPT-enabled response.\n\nA late 19th-century, satin-and-chiffon ballgown begins the show, its intricate embroidery of metallic threads, golden beads and sequins evoking sunbeams radiating from clouds. But the \"cloud dress\" by influential English designer Charles Frederick Worth is doomed, due to deterioration of the vertical threads -- \"there's nothing we can do about it,\" Bolton says. Except perhaps to recreate it digitally: On a screen nearby, an animated \"Pepper's ghost\" illusion that took nine months to perfect shows the gown dancing at a ball. The gown was donated by relatives of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, played on HBO's \"The Gilded Age\" by Donna Murphy.\n\nTHE SOUNDS OF 'SCROOP' (AND RAZOR CLAMS)\n\nA trio of gowns from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries explores the look of \"blurred blossoms\" -- the effect that makes a dress look like a watercolor or an Impressionist work. But in this gallery you also hear \"scroop\" -- the sound of silk taffeta rustling (a combination of the words \"scrape\" and \"whoop\"). The sound was captured in an echo-free chamber at Binghamton University. In another gallery, you can hear the clattering of razor clam shells, captured the same way -- accompanying McQueen's dramatic \"razor clam\" dress, covered with dried and bleached shells.\n\nA DIOR TO ADORE\n\nChristian Dior was influenced by Impressionist painters, and nowhere is this more evident than in the delicate floral embroidery on the famous Miss Dior dress, here a miniature version of the original. It looks just like a chic (and strapless) bouquet of flowers, and if you're dying to touch it, there's a small, white replica in 3D printed plastic. You can also run your hands over wallpaper created to match the shape and form of the flowers in the edgy 2013 Raf Simons version of the dress in black, with flowers in leather.\n\nSPEAKING OF EMBROIDERY\n\nIn 1988, Yves Saint Laurent paid homage to Van Gogh's famous depiction of irises a hundred years earlier, with a glistening jacket celebrated for its embroidery. The museum lays it flat to give a closer view of a garment that took 600 hours of work by artisans who used 250 meters of ribbon, 200,000 beads and 250,000 paillettes (spangles) in 22 colors.\n\nSMELL THE ROSES\n\nIn a show devoted to nature, it's hardly surprising to find rooms devoted to roses. And you're invited to smell them, via scents carried in plastic tubes -- not simply the smell of roses, but the smell of garments themselves and those who wore them. Bolton explains that Norwegian \"smell artist\" Sissel Tolaas brought an apparatus that extracted molecules from 57 garments. Two evening dresses, one by Saint Laurent for Dior and one by Lanvin, yielded molecules found in things like almonds and honey, tobacco and hay, and even \"a mild sex attractant for moths and cockroaches.\"\n\nSCENT OF A WOMAN\n\nYes, it was an Al Pacino movie -- but here, it's a gallery devoted to Millicent Rogers, a socialite, heiress and art collector known for her style and how she combined haute couture with regional dress. This gallery focuses on her scent, though, analyzing molecules from her garments -- like a 1938 Schiaparelli evening dress in blue silk crepe -- to discover her fragrances but also habits and lifestyle, \"including what she ate, drank and smoked.\"\n\nTHIS COAT IS ALIVE! (BUT NOT FOR LONG)\n\nA prime draw in the \"Garden Life\" section is a grass coat in which the wool itself has been planted, like soil, with oat, rye and wheatgrass. Right now, the design by gala honorary chair Jonathan Anderson of the label Loewe (a sponsor of the show) looks beautiful and green. But it is dying, because this version cannot be watered, and will be replaced about a week from opening with a version in a different stage of life. Also here: a slew of floral hats from the Met's copious collection. These, too, have been analyzed for smell -- eliciting scents containing hairspray, unsurprisingly, but also chewing gum, cigarettes and other things.\n\nDON'T FEED THESE BIRDS!\n\nBolton has said he wants to depict not just nature but shades of emotion -- including fear. Which is just what you may feel when you get to the part on flying things: insects and beetle wings, for example. Also, birds. McQueen is said to have adored Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds,\" and here we have his orange wool jacket printed with black swallows. The creepy part is the animation on the ceiling: first a few black birds, then more, then so many that the space turns an ominous black. The animation, created in consultation with wildlife experts, comprises \"14,000 digital swallows,\" ending with 4,000 simulated feathers. For sound, real swallow calls were recorded, and also the \"humming\" sound from the 1963 movie itself was captured to create tension.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" will open to the public Friday and run through Sept. 2.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press",

But the \"cloud dress\" by influential English designer Charles Frederick Worth is doomed, due to deterioration of the vertical threads -- \"there's nothing we can do about it,\" Bolton says. Except perhaps to recreate it digitally: On a screen nearby, an animated \"Pepper's ghost\" illusion that took nine months to perfect shows the gown dancing at a ball. The gown was donated by relatives of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, played on HBO's \"The Gilded Age\" by Donna Murphy.\n\nA trio of gowns from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries explores the look of \"blurred blossoms\" -- the effect that makes a dress look like a watercolor or an Impressionist work. But in this gallery you also hear \"scroop\" -- the sound of silk taffeta rustling (a combination of the words \"scrape\" and \"whoop\"). The sound was captured in an echo-free chamber at Binghamton University. In another gallery, you can hear the clattering of razor clam shells, captured the same way -- accompanying McQueen's dramatic \"razor clam\" dress, covered with dried and bleached shells.\n\nChristian Dior was influenced by Impressionist painters, and nowhere is this more evident than in the delicate floral embroidery on the famous Miss Dior dress, here a miniature version of the original. It looks just like a chic (and strapless) bouquet of flowers, and if you're dying to touch it, there's a small, white replica in 3D printed plastic. You can also run your hands over wallpaper created to match the shape and form of the flowers in the edgy 2013 Raf Simons version of the dress in black, with flowers in leather.\n\nIn 1988, Yves Saint Laurent paid homage to Van Gogh's famous depiction of irises a hundred years earlier, with a glistening jacket celebrated for its embroidery. The museum lays it flat to give a closer view of a garment that took 600 hours of work by artisans who used 250 meters of ribbon, 200,000 beads and 250,000 paillettes (spangles) in 22 colors.\n\nIn a show devoted to nature, it's hardly surprising to find rooms devoted to roses. And you're invited to smell them, via scents carried in plastic tubes -- not simply the smell of roses, but the smell of garments themselves and those who wore them. Bolton explains that Norwegian \"smell artist\" Sissel Tolaas brought an apparatus that extracted molecules from 57 garments. Two evening dresses, one by Saint Laurent for Dior and one by Lanvin, yielded molecules found in things like almonds and honey, tobacco and hay, and even \"a mild sex attractant for moths and cockroaches.\"\n\nYes, it was an Al Pacino movie -- but here, it's a gallery devoted to Millicent Rogers, a socialite, heiress and art collector known for her style and how she combined haute couture with regional dress. This gallery focuses on her scent, though, analyzing molecules from her garments -- like a 1938 Schiaparelli evening dress in blue silk crepe -- to discover her fragrances but also habits and lifestyle, \"including what she ate, drank and smoked.\"\n\nA prime draw in the \"Garden Life\" section is a grass coat in which the wool itself has been planted, like soil, with oat, rye and wheatgrass. Right now, the design by gala honorary chair Jonathan Anderson of the label Loewe (a sponsor of the show) looks beautiful and green. But it is dying, because this version cannot be watered, and will be replaced about a week from opening with a version in a different stage of life. Also here: a slew of floral hats from the Met's copious collection. These, too, have been analyzed for smell -- eliciting scents containing hairspray, unsurprisingly, but also chewing gum, cigarettes and other things.\n\nBolton has said he wants to depict not just nature but shades of emotion -- including fear. Which is just what you may feel when you get to the part on flying things: insects and beetle wings, for example. Also, birds. McQueen is said to have adored Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds,\" and here we have his orange wool jacket printed with black swallows. The creepy part is the animation on the ceiling: first a few black birds, then more, then so many that the space turns an ominous black. The animation, created in consultation with wildlife experts, comprises \"14,000 digital swallows,\" ending with 4,000 simulated feathers. For sound, real swallow calls were recorded, and also the \"humming\" sound from the 1963 movie itself was captured to create tension.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But there\u00b4s no way Sleeping Beauty - either before or after her nap - ever had quite the fabulous wardrobe that\u00b4s been assembled at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" the spring Costume Institute exhibit that debuts at Monday\u00b4s Met Gala, is not technically about THAT Sleeping Beauty. The title\u00b4s nod to the fairytale is actually a reference to the glass coffins - \"let\u00b4s be more upbeat and call them cases,\" quips curator Andrew Bolton - that hold 16 aging garments now so fragile that they can\u00b4t be shown upright. These delicate creatures have been slumbering, like Aurora herself, in the museum\u00b4s climate-controlled archives.\n\nBut these \"beauties\" are only a small fraction of the 220 items on display in the nature-themed \"Sleeping Beauties,\" which Bolton calls one of the institute\u00b4s most ambitious shows yet (his previous blockbusters include \"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\" and \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"). It\u00b4s also special to Bolton because every item on display is from the museum\u00b4s own collection.\n\nAnother key difference: This show will be a multisensory experience, involving not just sight but smell, sound and touch. Organized into themes of earth, air and water, the show makes use of a \"smell artist\" who extracted and analyzed molecules from clothing, creating scents visitors can now sniff from plastic tubes. Curators have also captured sounds of fabrics in an echo-free chamber, and used 3D scans to replicate embroidery patterns for touching.\n\nDespite the scale, \"I really wanted to make this intimate and participatory,\" Bolton said during a weekend tour through the show. In fact, there\u00b4s even a mannequin in a gown you can text a question to, and she\u00b4ll deliver a ChatGPT-enabled response.\n\nA few highlights:\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute gala exhibit, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in New York.

But there's no way Sleeping Beauty -- either before or after her nap -- ever had quite the fabulous wardrobe that's been assembled at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" the spring Costume Institute exhibit that debuts at Monday's Met Gala, is not technically about THAT Sleeping Beauty. The title's nod to the fairytale is actually a reference to the glass coffins -- \"let's be more upbeat and call them cases,\" quips curator Andrew Bolton -- that hold 16 aging garments now so fragile that they can't be shown upright. These delicate creatures have been slumbering, like Aurora herself, in the museum's climate-controlled archives.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bills Mailbag: Which rookies can be immediate contributors?

It's also special to Bolton because every item on display is from the museum's own collection.\n\nAnother key difference: This show will be a multisensory experience, involving not just sight but smell, sound and touch. Organized into themes of earth, air and water, the show makes use of a \"smell artist\" who extracted and analyzed molecules from clothing, creating scents visitors can now sniff from plastic tubes. Curators have also captured sounds of fabrics in an echo-free chamber, and used 3D scans to replicate embroidery patterns for touching.\n\nDespite the scale, \"I really wanted to make this intimate and participatory,\" Bolton said during a weekend tour through the show. In fact, there's even a mannequin in a gown you can text a question to, and she'll deliver a ChatGPT-enabled response.\n\nA few highlights:\n\nSTRAIGHT FROM 'THE GILDED AGE'\n\nA late 19th-century, satin-and-chiffon ballgown begins the show, its intricate embroidery of metallic threads, golden beads and sequins evoking sunbeams radiating from clouds. But the \"cloud dress\" by influential English designer Charles Frederick Worth is doomed, due to deterioration of the vertical threads -- \"there's nothing we can do about it,\" Bolton says. Except perhaps to recreate it digitally: On a screen nearby, an animated \"Pepper's ghost\" illusion that took nine months to perfect shows the gown dancing at a ball. The gown was donated by relatives of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, played on HBO's \"The Gilded Age\" by Donna Murphy.\n\nTHE SOUNDS OF 'SCROOP' (AND RAZOR CLAMS)\n\nA trio of gowns from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries explores the look of \"blurred blossoms\" -- the effect that makes a dress look like a watercolor or an Impressionist work. But in this gallery you also hear \"scroop\" -- the sound of silk taffeta rustling (a combination of the words \"scrape\" and \"whoop\"). The sound was captured in an echo-free chamber at Binghamton University. In another gallery, you can hear the clattering of razor clam shells, captured the same way -- accompanying McQueen's dramatic \"razor clam\" dress, covered with dried and bleached shells.\n\nA DIOR TO ADORE\n\nChristian Dior was influenced by Impressionist painters, and nowhere is this more evident than in the delicate floral embroidery on the famous Miss Dior dress, here a miniature version of the original. It looks just like a chic (and strapless) bouquet of flowers, and if you're dying to touch it, there's a small, white replica in 3D printed plastic. You can also run your hands over wallpaper created to match the shape and form of the flowers in the edgy 2013 Raf Simons version of the dress in black, with flowers in leather.\n\nSPEAKING OF EMBROIDERY\n\nIn 1988, Yves Saint Laurent paid homage to Van Gogh's famous depiction of irises a hundred years earlier, with a glistening jacket celebrated for its embroidery. The museum lays it flat to give a closer view of a garment that took 600 hours of work by artisans who used 250 meters of ribbon, 200,000 beads and 250,000 paillettes (spangles) in 22 colors.\n\nSMELL THE ROSES\n\nIn a show devoted to nature, it's hardly surprising to find rooms devoted to roses. And you're invited to smell them, via scents carried in plastic tubes -- not simply the smell of roses, but the smell of garments themselves and those who wore them. Bolton explains that Norwegian \"smell artist\" Sissel Tolaas brought an apparatus that extracted molecules from 57 garments. Two evening dresses, one by Saint Laurent for Dior and one by Lanvin, yielded molecules found in things like almonds and honey, tobacco and hay, and even \"a mild sex attractant for moths and cockroaches.\"\n\nSCENT OF A WOMAN\n\nYes, it was an Al Pacino movie -- but here, it's a gallery devoted to Millicent Rogers, a socialite, heiress and art collector known for her style and how she combined haute couture with regional dress. This gallery focuses on her scent, though, analyzing molecules from her garments -- like a 1938 Schiaparelli evening dress in blue silk crepe -- to discover her fragrances but also habits and lifestyle, \"including what she ate, drank and smoked.\"\n\nTHIS COAT IS ALIVE! (BUT NOT FOR LONG)\n\nA prime draw in the \"Garden Life\" section is a grass coat in which the wool itself has been planted, like soil, with oat, rye and wheatgrass. Right now, the design by gala honorary chair Jonathan Anderson of the label Loewe (a sponsor of the show) looks beautiful and green. But it is dying, because this version cannot be watered, and will be replaced about a week from opening with a version in a different stage of life. Also here: a slew of floral hats from the Met's copious collection. These, too, have been analyzed for smell -- eliciting scents containing hairspray, unsurprisingly, but also chewing gum, cigarettes and other things.\n\nDON'T FEED THESE BIRDS!\n\nBolton has said he wants to depict not just nature but shades of emotion -- including fear. Which is just what you may feel when you get to the part on flying things: insects and beetle wings, for example. Also, birds. McQueen is said to have adored Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds,\" and here we have his orange wool jacket printed with black swallows. The creepy part is the animation on the ceiling: first a few black birds, then more, then so many that the space turns an ominous black. The animation, created in consultation with wildlife experts, comprises \"14,000 digital swallows,\" ending with 4,000 simulated feathers. For sound, real swallow calls were recorded, and also the \"humming\" sound from the 1963 movie itself was captured to create tension.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" will open to the public Friday and run through Sept. 2.\n\nFor more coverage of the 2024 Met Gala, visit https://apnews.com/hub/met-gala.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

{"uri": "2024-05-346472904", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-06", "time": "12:29:22", "dateTime": "2024-05-06T12:29:22Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-06T12:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/exclusive-preview-met-sleeping-beauties-121500939.html", "title": "Exclusive Preview of The Met's 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion'", "body": "This week's opening of \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute couldn't be further away from a sleepy fairytale.\n\nVisitors will wend their way through a series of 29 rooms, where 16 \"Sleeping Beauties\" -- garments that are too fragile to hang on mannequins -- are entombed in glass. While many of the 220 garments, accessories and buttons are dazzlers, the overall experience - and it is just that - is an assault on the senses and new terrain for an exhibition - fashion or otherwise. Beyond the naked eye, ticket-holders will put their senses to the test. There are four galleries infused with molecular smell recordings, four galleries amplifying sound recordings, four galleries with CGI and/or digital avatars, three galleries with poetry readings, two galleries that encourage \"forbidden museum behavior\" - touching objects - and a finale of a gallery that features a ChatGPT-powered interaction that was created by Open AI.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nWhile the earliest known version of the makings of the narrative \"Sleeping Beauty\" traces back to 1330, The Met's multi-sensory and digitally-enhanced show is very much about the future. During a preview Sunday afternoon, Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, said, \"For me, this is just the beginning in my curatorial practice. I like the idea of going forward with this sensorial and emotional approach to fashion,\" adding that creating a sound and scent database for select items would be part of that equation.\n\nThe premise for \"Sleeping Beauties\" is to reawaken costumes from the Costume Institute's 33,000-piece collection \"through the senses so that you can actually smell, touch, hear and of course see them,\" Bolton said. Playing up the participatory, visitors can run their palms over the \"touch wall,\" a 3D-printed plastic version of the embroidered pattern for Raf Simon's 2013 \"Miss Dior\" dress for Dior. They can also feel the 3D replica pattern of Dior's 2014 \"Mini Miss Dior\" dress nearby, as well as admire a real version in vivid colors beneath a bell jar.\n\nThe prismatic effect is evident throughout the show, including at the entrance of the exhibition, where Brancusi's 1910 \"Sleeping Muse\" bronze rests. That visage was the inspiration for the mannequin that wears the show's final look - a 1930 Callot Soeurs wedding ensemble. Positioned atop an all-white amphitheater, the dress comes to life in other ways too. With a quick QR scan, visitors can use ChatGPT to interact with the gown's former owner - Jazz Age-era socialite Natalie Potter. Adding another dimension is what Bolton described as \"a honeymoon fan,\" an 1869 cottonwood handheld fan that was inscribed like a diary by a 19-year-old bride, who detailed the three weeks after her wedding.\n\nFrom the start, the ancient versus the futuristic is clear. Take Charles Frederick Worth's \"Cloud\" dress, an 1887 silk satin and chiffon ballgown with \"warp loss,\" which is caused by the deterioration of horizontal threads. Rather than mask those imperfections, the lighting on the garment directs the eye to that \"inherent weakness, which is causing its demise,\" Bolton said. Opposite that is a reimagined version of the ball gown on a form seemingly dancing in what is a \"Pepper's ghost,\" an illusionary technique in which an image of an object offstage is projected so that it appears to be in front of the audience. Creating that digital version took more than six months and 40 different renderings. (Fittingly, that is accompanied by a musical score of Tchaikovsky's \"Sleeping Beauty.\") A \"reawakening,\" so to speak, of the Worth gown is steps away - a Alessandro Michele-designed fall 2017 Gucci cape.\n\nThe technological effects make the past more approachable in myriad ways, from the projecting slides on a wall to the more complex AI and CGI, Bolton said. \"What people sometimes don't understand is that when a garment comes into a museum, it can't be touched anymore, smelled, heard or worn, so you have to rely on sight. Since fashion is a living art form, it depends on the body to activate it. Fashion is almost asking to be touched. It evinces so many senses unlike a painting, which is put on a wall and is just seen.\"\n\nThe nature-heavy theme courses throughout the exhibition, which opens to the public on Wednesday and will run through Sept. 2. The multi-sensory combinations are of varying degrees in the galleries that are meant to be case studies of Painted Flowers, Blurred Blossoms, Dior's Garden, Van Gogh's Flowers, Poppies, Garthwaite's Garden, The Red Rose, The Specter of the Rose, the Scent of a Man, the Scent of a Woman, Resada Luteola, The Garden, Garden Life, Insects, Beetle Wings, Butterflies, The Birds, The Nightingale and the Rose, Marine Life, Venus, Seashells, The Siren, Snakes, The Mermaid, and The Mermaid Bride.\n\nSome of the more unexpected elements, especially the digital ones, have been crafted and perfected by the exhibition's creative consultant and Showstudio's Nick Knight, who created AI and CGI imagery, including a projection of a dying rose. At times, scent is the lead attraction, as in The Specter of the Rose, which draws upon the idea that perfume often remains embedded in a garment. Smell researcher and artist Sissel Tolaas translated fragrances using peak molecules from three dresses -- including Paul Poiret's 1913 \"La Rose d'Iribe\" dress -- into scented paint that has been applied to three sections of a nearby wall that visitors can rub to smell each scent. In another area, the intricate embroidery of a 1615-1620 waistcoat has been reimagined in an interactive embossed wallpaper that was made to the specifications of Braille.\n\nA symphony of scents can be wafted in Scent of a Woman, which showcases numerous floral hats and a fall 1938 House of Schiaparelli blue silk crepe evening dress that belonged to Millicent Rogers. Met goers can use the nearby plastic tubes to smell six peak molecules from the Standard Oil heiress' dress. \"You're actually smelling Millicent Rogers,\" Bolton said. \"You're smelling not only the fragrance she wore, but her natural body odors, what she ate, what she drank, what she smoked and where she lived.\" All of those smells have been extracted by Tolaas.\n\nMortality is hinted at in the Poppies area, where actor Morgan Specter can be heard reading John McRae's 1915 poem \"In Flanders Field, which hails the World War I soldiers who died on the Western Front. A 1937 Ana de Pombe evening dress has a poppies print that evokes drops of blood. Nearby, a spring 2015 Viktor & Rolf haute couture laser-cut poppy-inspired ensemble with a headpiece of straw and carbon fiber rods is a showstopper.\n\nFear also creeps into the picture, especially in The Birds gallery, which contains two orange Alexander McQueen jackets, including a spring 1995 one with screenprinting by Simon Ungless and Andrew Groves, while hand painted swallows are on view in a fall 1938 Madeleine Vionnet evening dress with a pattern of swallows. It is the large-scale film projection of a swarm of swallows that increasingly fill the sky that grabs the eye. Updated takes of flapping bird wings from the soundtrack from Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 thriller \"The Birds\" can be heard. Snakes might also make some attendees jumpy since Iris van Herpen's fall 2011 \"Snake\" dress is set against a Knight-made visual of slithering snakes.\n\nVan Gogh's Flowers are unmissable for the display of Yves Saint Laurent's \"Irises\" jacket, which was inspired by the Impressionist's 1889 painting of the same name. Overhead, a spinning projection zooms in on the boldness and intricacies of the garment's embroidery. Workers at Maison Lesage needed 600 hours of handwork, 200,000 beads and 150,000 paillettes in 22 colors to complete the garment.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties\" also has green shots of major talent, including one of Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson's grass-sprouting coats that are literally still growing in a glass case. Prior to its installation, the Costume Institute team has been tending to the coat that was embedded with seeds in an irrigated grow tent. A time-lapsed video of that device serves as the backdrop. But after a week on view, the garment will have to be swapped out for a dried version of one for the duration of the show's run.\n\nAnderson and TikTok's chief executive officer Shou Chew will serve as honorary chairs at Monday night's Met Gala. TikTok is the lead sponsor of the exhibition, with support from Loewe and additional support from Conde Nast. Asked about the TikTok factor, given a looming U.S. ban of the social media platform Bolton said, \"When we approached TikTok, it was so exciting for us because it's a huge platform. Obviously, it's about technology. Hopefully, our shows will reach a huge audience. That was and still is really exciting for us.\"\n\nAsked about any worries regarding a pushback for that choice, Bolton said, \"We'll have to see how things develop [with the issue of a U.S. ban.\"\n\nNature is meant to be seen as \"the ultimate metaphor for fashion,\" and one that relays a message of rebirth and renewal, Bolton said, \"We also wanted to use this as an opportunity to engage with designers, who are involved more deeply in ethical, sustainable practices and acquire pieces from them.\"\n\nOther environmentally enterprising creations are Conner Ives' \"Couture Girl\" dress from the designer's 2020 graduate collection entitled \"the American Dream.\" The bulbous creation was made from dead-stock fabric donated by Carolina Herrera's creative director Wes Gordon and was made with paillettes made from recycled PET by the Sustainable Sequin Co. Ives hand embroidered 10,000-plus sequins basing the shapes on his four favorite flowers. In \"The Mermaid\" area of the show, there is Phillip Lim's 2021 \"Algae Sequin\" dress, which is made of biodegradable rayon mesh derived from bamboo and seaweed. Sustainability and the ethics of fashion should be seen as part of fashion and not designated in a special section, nor be unjustly criticized for its aesthetic, Bolton said.\n\nIn the \"Seashells\" area, visitors will not only see Alexander McQueen's spring 2001 dress made from razor clamshells but they will hear what it sounds like in motion. A recording was made in an anechoic chamber. There are also other sea-worthy creations so to speak, like an Iris van Herpen's 3D printed haute couture ensemble with spiraling shell forms, as well as a row of shell-shaped handbags by Judith Leiber.\n\nConsidering the breadth of \"Sleeping Beauties\" and the depth of details, it's not surprising that the show's layout was designed to look like a molecular formula if seen from above. Given the technology and fashion combination, Bolton said, \"In a way, it's like marrying the poetics of fashion with the poetics of science.\"\n\nLaunch Gallery: The Met Previews \"Sleeping Beauties:

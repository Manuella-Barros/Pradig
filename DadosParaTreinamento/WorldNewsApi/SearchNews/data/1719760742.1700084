{"id": 225019468, "title": "Donald Trump's 'Misleading' Sign From the Jury", "text": "Former President Donald Trump may get a \"misleading\" sign from the jury during deliberations of his hush money payment case, according to Michael McAuliffe, a former federal prosecutor and former elected state attorney.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment allegedly made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged the payment was meant to prevent her from speaking publicly about her claims of having an affair with the former president. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied the affair. He has accused Bragg's office of targeting him for political purposes.Jury deliberations began on Wednesday as the jury will determine whether Trump is either guilty or innocent in the first prosecution of a former president in a criminal case.Legal experts told Newsweek there are several indications that could signal which way the jury is leaning.McAuliffe predicted the deliberations could last longer than usual\u2014perhaps even longer than a week\u2014because the case involves a former president, and that reading into how long the deliberations last could prove to be \"misleading.\"\"The length of deliberations might well prove misleading as to the end result,\" he said.He added that questions from the jurors and answers given could also be telling, as they are typically read in open court.Former federal prosecutor Shanlon Wu agreed that those questions could be an indication of where they are leaning.\"You can tell a lot usually from the questions they may ask by sending out notes,\" he told Newsweek. \"If you get notes asking...to have certain portions of a testimony reread to them, because they don't get a full transcript, or if they have certain questions about exhibits, it can tell us what it is that they're focusing on.\"These questions could indicate confusion or disagreement about pieces of evidence, so prosecutors may prefer to have fewer or no questions, he said. Meanwhile, if they have a lot of questions early on in deliberations, it could indicate there is one person who is \"stuck one way or another.\"An \"extremely fast\" verdict would also be good for Trump, as people are unlikely to condemn and judge somebody as guilty easily, according to Wu.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment via email.Former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade offered a different perspective. She told Newsweek that while lawyers may \"tie themselves in knots looking for signs of the direction a jury is leaning,\" these questions may only be to help a juror refresh their recollection. It can be difficult to predict what they are thinking, she said.In her experience, the estimate is that a jury will take about a day of deliberations per week of testimony.\"Here, that would mean six days of deliberations. They need to work through each of the 34 counts individually, sifting through the oven to determine whether it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. That will take some time. I would not be concerned about a trial until we reach beyond six or seven days,\" she said.Neama Rahmani, also a former federal prosecutor, told Newsweek that the case is complicated \"because of its political nature and convoluted legal arguments.\" He noted that \"pro-prosecution questions or evidence may be the majority trying to convince holdout jurors.\"He said he believes an acquittal is unlikely, so a long deliberation could suggest a hung jury.If a jury is initially unable to reach a verdict, Judge Juan Merchan would likely send them back to try again, at least once. A mistrial would only happen if it appears the jury is truly deadlocked and unable to reach an agreement.", "summary": "As jury deliberations begin in Trump's trial, legal experts said there are signs that may indicate how the jury is leaning.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-how-jury-leaning-hush-money-trial-1905526", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400173/donald-trump-jury-deliberations.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:55:29", "author": "Andrew Stanton", "authors": ["Andrew Stanton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.413}

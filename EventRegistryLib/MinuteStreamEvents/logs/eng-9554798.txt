The changes have toughened the requirements for their use.\n\nFor example, the newly codified version of court guidance states that migrants must be at \"imminent risk of irreparable harm\" if they are deported. It mirrors the language in the Government's own legislation.\n\nMr Chalk said: \"There will be some who take the view that the law should be no impediment to tackling irregular migration.

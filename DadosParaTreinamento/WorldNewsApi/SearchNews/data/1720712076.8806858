If you want advice on spending, saving, or investing \u2014 or any of the complicated emotions that may come up as you prepare to make big financial decisions \u2014 you can submit your question on this form. Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed. I'm currently 27 and am fortunate enough to still live at home with my parents and have a solid-paying local government job. I could be more financially literate in a lot of areas, however, investment is one that I should probably focus on now. I have not been using any of my life earnings to grow a larger sum. Dear 27, I\u2019m fairly bearish on investing, as you may know if you\u2019ve read my column for a while. Yes, you can do the math on \u201cif you invest $1,000 every month for 35 years with an average 6 percent return, you\u2019ll retire a millionaire,\u201d but the way to figure out if that kind of advice is worth your attention is to look around at all of the retirees you know and ask yourself how many of them are millionaires. It\u2019s not just that investing $1,000 every month for 35 years is unrealistic for most people, although it very much is. It\u2019s also that you can\u2019t count on the 6 percent return. Some years may only deliver a 4 percent return. Other years may deliver a negative return \u2014 and that\u2019s before you get into the crashes and corrections. Even if today\u2019s retirees had been diligent about adding money to their portfolios every month, they might have lost a significant chunk of the value of their portfolio three separate times (the dot-com bust, the global financial crisis, and the post-pandemic bear market). The market may rebound relatively quickly, but it takes much longer for compound interest to catch up. With that in mind, let me ask you the questions I always ask. Why do you want to grow your life\u2019s earnings into a larger sum, and is investing the only way to do that? Living with your parents while working a solid-paying government job is an excellent way to add to your savings. CD ladders are guaranteed bets right now, and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) are still going strong. From my perspective, there are many different ways to increase your net worth \u2014 and that\u2019s even before we get into the question of how you might grow your income over the next 35 years. I\u2019m not going to discourage you from investing, of course, especially because you can get significant tax advantages from traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, HSAs, and the like. I\u2019ll also remind you that I am not an investment advisor, but standard financial advice suggests that you look into index funds instead of, like, becoming a day trader. Also, don't forget to compare expense ratios. That said, we need to go back to the question of why you want more money. Down payment for a house? You probably don't want to invest to do that, as the time horizon\u2019s too small. Start a business? Ditto. Retirement? Sure, get those tax deductions and put your money somewhere that you can\u2019t touch without paying a penalty. Investment could work, in that case, even though you could also put your retirement savings in CDs. But if you just feel this weird sense that you\u2019re leaving money on the table by not investing, well \u2014 go read Helaine Olen\u2019s excellent book Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry, go watch any of Dan Olson\u2019s investing analyses on Folding Ideas (including \u201cLine Goes Up\u201d and \u201cThis Is Financial Advice\u201d), and remember that there is no such thing as an average 6 percent return. Know the risk you\u2019re taking before you take it, and don\u2019t invest any money you can\u2019t afford to lose. I\u2019m starting a business and I want to find a mentor. I\u2019m emailing everyone I can, but I\u2019m not getting any response. How do I build that kind of relationship? Dear Mentees (since there were two of you who wrote in with a variation of this question), While there are various organizations that could help you match your small business with a small business mentor, including your local library, your local Chamber of Commerce, and the alumni center of any institution you may have graduated from, the type of mentorship you\u2019re going to find after an evening of networking or an hour-long lunch with a patient alumnus is likely to be shallow at best. The best way to earn true mentorship \u2014 the kind that can actually help you get a business off the ground \u2014 is by proving you\u2019re ready to do the work. Mentorship, like nearly all forms of relationship, is one of those deals where you can\u2019t just go ask someone to give you what you want. Not even if your small business idea is a really, really good one. You have to help someone else first before people will be willing to help you. In some cases, you may need to get someone to hire you. However, you don\u2019t want to end up working a demanding or unfulfilling job just because you think the boss might notice you someday. If you can find a potential mentor who needs a right-hand assistant in a business that is coincidentally similar to the one you want to start, well, that could work \u2014 but those kinds of jobs often go to people the mentor already knows. Which means you may have to be helpful in other ways. There are in-person and online communities for small business owners, for example, and if you contribute positively to those communities you may find people eager to mentor your business. This would, of course, be a more positive contribution than simply showing up to an event and passing out your business cards. You want to be the kind of person whom everyone knows, and the kind of person who can be counted on to add value to a conversation. You may even want to become the kind of person who helps to plan and host the events where all of the other people stand around and pass out their business cards. You could also volunteer at any kind of organization that attracts smart, ambitious people \u2014 arts groups, political groups, and so on \u2014 and catch a potential mentor\u2019s eye that way. If your business idea is really, really, really good and you want to shortcut all of that, look into stuff like Emergent Ventures or Y Combinator. Keep in mind that the first question these mentor-investors may ask is, \u201cHow is your business going to help someone else?\u201d Make sure you know that answer \u2014 like, really, really, really know it \u2014 along with the answer to the question, \u201cHow is your business going to make money?\u201d But you can stop the cold emails. As you already know, they aren\u2019t getting you any response.", "summary": "On the Money is a monthly advice column.

{"id": 223703902, "title": "Trump Third Reich rhetoric: Darcy cartoons", "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Self-proclaimed designated Dictator Donald Trump posting of a \u201cUnified Reich\u201d and spewing of a \u201cThird term\u201d are just the latest in the too long march of jack-booted dog whistling from him and his campaign team. This past week, posted on Trump\u2019s social media channel was a video parodying headlines if Trump wins reelection: \u201cLANDSLIDE\u201d; \u201cECONOMY BOOMS\u201d, \u201cBORDER IS CLOSED\u201d, \u201cWHAT\u2019S NEXT AMERICA.\u201d Under the later was a sub-headline reading \u201cUnified Reich.\u201d Following the firestorm that post sparked, Trump quickly removed the post claiming it had been made by a third party and posted by a campaign staffer who had not noticed the \u201cUnified Reich\u201d text. That damage control spin from wannabe Dictator Donald conflicts with his previous claims that only he or top aid Boris Epstein post on his \u201cTruth Social\u201d account. The video template used by the Trump campaign was created by a 30-year-old graphic designer working from Istanbul, Turkey. He said 16 copies of the template have sold for $21 each. The Trump campaign obviously didn\u2019t bother to switch out the \u201cUnified Reich\u201d graphics when posting their customized version. Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly, a retired 4 star General, said Trump had once praised Adolf Hitler. Kelly said Trump once said to him \u201cWell, but Hitler did some good things,\u201d Hitler \u201cRebuilt the economy.\u201d Trump when talking about immigrants has also used language taken from Hitler\u2019s book \u201cMein Kampf\u201d, describing immigrants as \u201cVermin\u201d \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d Trump\u2019s first wife Ivanka, wrote that he used to keep a book of Hitler\u2019s speeches next to their bed, defying claims Trump doesn\u2019t like to read. On Truth Social can we next expect to see for sale brown shirts and red \u201cMake Third Reich Great Again\u201d hats? \"", "summary": "Self-proclaimed Dictator Donald Trump posting of a \"Unified Reich\" and spewing of a \"Third term\" is just the latest in a march of jack-booted dog whistling from him and his campaign.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/darcy/2024/05/trump-third-reich-rhetoric-darcy-cartoons.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WEZIWAFKWZHKJFQYQ3GHTNXVS4.jpg?auth=ceae4fe2cc7bdcb76be7449b271014c32b1993bb23e5dcc1c846bf7885931826&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:07", "author": "Jeff Darcy", "authors": ["Jeff Darcy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.12}

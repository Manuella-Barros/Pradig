The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which reported \u201csevere heatwave conditions\u201d, recorded the temperature in the Delhi suburb of Mungeshpur on Wednesday afternoon, smashing the previous national record in the desert of Rajasthan by more one degree Celsius. The temperature was about ten degrees higher than expected, the second day of record-breaking heat, and well above the 2002 record of 49.2 degrees. The IMD has issued a red alert health notice for the city, with an estimated population of more than 30 million people. The alert warns there is a \u201cvery high likelihood of developing heat illness and heatstroke in all ages\u201d, with \u201cextreme care needed for vulnerable people\u201d. India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures, but years of scientific research have found climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense. But people on the streets of Delhi said there was little they could to do to avoid the heat. \u201cEveryone wants to stay indoors,\u201d said snack-seller Roop Ram, 57, adding he struggled to sell his savoury fritters. Ram, who lives with his wife and two sons in a cramped house, said they had a small fan, but that did little to cool them down. They were counting down until the rainy season arrives in July. \u201cI am not sure what else we can do to cope,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just waiting for the monsoon.\u201d Rani, 60, who uses only one name, travels by bus for two hours each morning to sell jewellery to tourists at a makeshift street stall. \u201cIt is definitely hotter, but there is nothing we can do about it,\u201d she said, gulping water from a bottle she brought from home. \u201cI try to refill the bottle from anyone around.\u201d Heat remains high even at night, the IMD said, noting that the temperatures were \u201clikely to reduce gradually\u201d from Thursday. New Delhi authorities have also warned of the risk of water shortages as the capital swelters in headache-inducing heat, cutting supplies to some areas. Delhi Water Minister Atishi, who only uses one name, said supplies had been halved in many areas to boost flow to \u201cwater-deficient areas\u201d. Atishi on Wednesday ordered state authorities to \u201cimmediately deploy 200 teams\u201d to crackdown construction sites or commercial properties using domestic pipes to stem a \u201cserious wastage of water\u201d. Delhi relies almost entirely on water from neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, both farming states with huge water demands. The highly polluted Yamuna river, a tributary of the Ganges, runs through Delhi, but its flow is hugely reduced during the summer months. Many blame the soaring temperatures on scorching winds from Rajasthan state, where temperatures on Tuesday were the hottest in the country at 50.5 degrees. Rajasthan\u2019s desert region of Phalodi holds India\u2019s all-time heat record of 51 degrees, hit in 2016. Neighbouring Pakistan has also sweltered through a week-long heatwave, which peaked at 53 degrees on Sunday in Mohenjo Daro in rural Sindh province. Pakistan\u2019s meteorological office said it expected temperatures to subside from Wednesday but warned further heatwaves were coming in June. It comes as Pakistan hashes out a new deal with the International Monetary Fund that is believed to focus heavily on an energy supply crisis that has left parts of the country facing up to 15 hours of load-shedding a day. At the same time, India\u2019s West Bengal state and the northeastern state of Mizoram are recovering after a cyclone hit India and Bangladesh on Sunday, killing at least 65 people. Bangladesh\u2019s Meteorological Department said the cyclone was \u201cone of [the] longest in the country\u2019s history\u201d, blaming climate change for the shift.", "summary": "The temperature was about ten degrees higher than expected, the second day of record-breaking heat, and well above the 2002 record of 49.2 degrees.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3264593/indias-capital-hits-record-523-degrees-fierce-heatwave-everyone-wants-stay-indoors-waiting-monsoon", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/29/4591e7bd-40ed-417b-8765-ac7888101d20_e596b78c.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:23", "author": "Agence France-presse", "authors": ["Agence France-presse"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.052}

It is difficult to say that Edmonton should make any changes to the forward ranks heading into Game 2. The dozen who dressed played pretty well. They just did not finish. You do have three veterans in Derek Ryan, Sam Gagner and Sam Carrick in the press box with a combined 1,853 NHL games. The Oilers were just 40% on draws in Game 1.

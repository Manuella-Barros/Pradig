And we need the help because we have 800,000 people,\u201d he said, adding that its small population and high revenue projections would place it among the highest per capita income earners globally within two years. \u201cWe really need a million more people to build what we have. We only have 300,000 working people, not all of which are skilled. So what we need and what we have are two completely different things. Kissoon was recently re-elected Amcham Guyana president and visited TT to deliver an address to Amcham TT\u2019s members, following its election which saw Stuart Franco also re-elected president. Kissoon said that the two chambers have always been close-knit, crediting Amcham TT for helping launch Amcham Guyana in 2018, adding that the synergy of the two chambers is \u201cincredibly important.\u201d He said just as he was welcomed in TT, the \u201cGuyanese are looking forward to receiving all of you with open arms.\u201d Guyana produces about 650,000 barrels of oil daily, making it among the top 20 oil producers globally, and it is expected to increase to 1.5 million barrels within the next two years, attracting \u201cgreat opportunity,\u201d Kissoon said. \u201cGuyana\u2019s trajectory has been robust, surprising and unexpected. Our GDP is exploding,\u201d he said, noting its growth by 68 per cent this year. Yet the country \u201cknows what is to be poor,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a huge emphasis on diversifying our economy.\u201d He said agriculture, including corn and soybean production, plays a major role in diversifying Guyana\u2019s economy, as is fertiliser produced from gas. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to have a stable economy \u2013 not governed by oil and gas,\u201d he said, noting Guyana\u2019s investments in wind-, solar- and hydro-energy sources. \u201cWe did the world\u2019s first and only carbon credit sale valued at US$750 million\u2026not to cut down our rainforests,\u201d he said, referring to a deal with Hess Corporation \u2013 an American international energy company involved in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Associated Press reported in December 2020 that the company agreed to buy $750 million worth of carbon credits from Guyana \u201cin the next decade as it works to ensure Guyana\u2019s almost intact Amazonian rainforests remain standing for decades to come\u2026\u201d Guyana is taking on massive infrastructural projects, including an almost complete road to Brazil, providing a route for convenient agricultural exports, and a deep-water port to service the rest of South America. \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of opportunity for growth that will benefit all of us as a Caribbean nation,\u201d said Kissoon. Guyana and TT are ideal partners since the two countries share similar legal and tax systems and have treaties. Kissoon highlighted Guyana\u2019s other working advantages. \u201cGuyana doesn\u2019t have an restrictions on residency, shareholding, or control. We have no foreign-exchange restrictions; the US currency is free traded and is available (to do work).\u201d Currently, the Local Content Act, passed by Guyana on December 31, 2021, mandates companies use Guyanese goods, services and personnel in 40 sectors, specifically in its burgenoning energy sector.", "summary": "<p><img width=\"825\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23236197-825x510.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>DEVINDRA Kissoon, president of the American Chamber of Commerce (Amcham) Guyana, wants Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s business community to set up shop in Guyana and help it to become one of the world's richest countries per capita as is projected.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally and truly, the country is open for business in every single facet,\u201d Kissoon told an audience of business executives at a forum after Amcham TT\u2019s 31st annual general meeting on June 7 at Hilton Trinidad, Port of Spain.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery single business in which each of you is involved, there\u2019s an opportunity for you.

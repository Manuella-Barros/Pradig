An image from the game shows Dallas Wings rookie Jacy Sheldon falling back on one of Clark's moves. It was a bit of a \"welcome to the WNBA\" moment for Sheldon, even though Clark is also a rookie.\n\nThe Wings got the last laugh as Arike Ogunbowale hit the game-winning three pointer with three seconds remaining in the contest. If the preseason matchup was any indication, basketball fans are in for a show during the WNBA season.\n\nClark did not appear to need an adjustment period posting 21 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in her WNBA preseason debut. The guard likely would like to have her 5 turnovers back.\n\nThe Fever have one more preseason game remaining against the Atlanta Dream on May 9. Clark will make her WNBA regular season debut against the Connecticut Sun on May 14.\n\nClark and the Fever would have liked to have gotten the win, but the star praised the overall environment for the preseason opener. The Indiana guard expects more of the same throughout the WNBA season.\n\n\"Yeah, I think the fans are always what makes women's basketball so fun,\" Clark noted during a May 3 press conference. \"I think over the course of the last couple years it's just grown and grown. For them to come out and support during my first WNBA game, it's really special. Not only for myself, but both teams on the court. They get to see how good this product is.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better game, really, for women's basketball like to kick off this year. Just a tremendous game, coming down to the wire. Both teams competing and that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nThe No. 1 pick is already noticing some of the differences between her time at Iowa and life in the W. Clark's biggest observation is that you have to play hard during \"every single second.\"\n\n\"I think that's the biggest thing is like when you're on the court with this much talent, you can't take a second off,\" Clark exlained. \"You relax for one second and they're going to beat you on a screen. They're going to beat you on a whatever [the play] is. I think that's the biggest thing is like you cannot relax in this league for one second.\n\n\"So, I think getting used to that, just playing hard every single second,\" Clark added. \"But yeah, I think overall we did a really good job, played everybody, executed. I thought we could have done a little bit better job, slowed it down a little bit in the second half and got into our sets a little better.

The fans showed out to see Clark make her WNBA debut and the cheapest tickets for the game were over $100... for a preseason game. The Wings ended up taking down the Fever, 79-76, but Clark had a great game in her debut.\n\nCaitlin Clark dominated the college basketball scene when she was at Iowa, but the WNBA is a different story. Everyone was wondering how she would perform against the best of the best, and she showed up in her first game. Clark finished with 21 points on 6/15 shooting and she was 5/13 from three. She also added two assists and three rebounds.\n\nThe Fever didn't get the win, but overall, Clark was pretty happy with how the team looked. It's just preseason, so this a good time to work on things and get better without having the pressure of needing to win basketball games.\n\n\"I thought we played really hard,\" Clark said after the game in an interview. \"Just a great atmosphere for women's basketball, I think it's a good kickoff to the WNBA season. I think the way we played, I think there were some things that we could've executed a little bit better, I thought we could've gotten into our offense a little bit better. The pace was amazing, that's fun basketball, people like to watch, but overall, definitely what I expected.\"\n\nPlaying in the WNBA is new to Clark and transitioning from college to the pros can be difficult. This preseason will be big for her in terms of learning what the WNBA is going to be like and growing her game to get her ready for the regular season.\n\n\"I think just the little things, knowing when to push in transition and knowing when to slow up and run our offense a little bit better,\" Clark said in regards to what can be improved going forward. \"I think overall our defense was pretty good, I think we could've gotten better in some areas. I thought we could've passed the ball a little bit better, but overall a lot to learn from, this is a learning experience for us, this doesn't count. Go back and watch some film, film doesn't lie and learn from that.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark will make her regular season debut soon\n\nFriday night's game was just a preseason a battle, and the Fever have one more preseason game next week as they will be taking on the Atlanta Dream on Thursday night. That will be the last preseason game for Indiana before the regular season gets going.\n\nCaitlin Clark will make her highly anticipated WNBA regular season debut on May 14th as the Fever will be hitting the road to take on the Connecticut Sun. That game will get going at 7:30 ET and it will be airing on ESPN2. The Sun are currently favored by 5.5 points.

Celebrities are wearing Indiana Fever jerseys. Google searches for the league are higher than ever.\n\nEveryone is talking about the WNBA. And the hype is real.\n\nSpearheaded by the star power of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other top college players, women's basketball is enjoying a surge of popularity -- even eclipsing men's hoops at times.\n\nLast month's women's national championship game between the University of South Carolina and the University of Iowa was the most-watched basketball game -- including the NBA -- since 2019.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLuxury fashion houses requested to dress players for the recent WNBA draft. Star rookies like Clark, Reese, Cameron Brink and others are already mainstays in national commercials, as are veterans such as the Seattle Storm's Jewell Lloyd (catch her repping State Farm) and the now-retired Sue Bird.\n\nSo if you're one of the new WNBA fans who doesn't quite know where to start following the league, you're in luck. Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nProfessional WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Tags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional * I understand

Celebrities are wearing Indiana Fever jerseys. Google searches for the league are higher than ever.\n\nEveryone is talking about the WNBA. And the hype is real.\n\nSpearheaded by the star power of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other top college players, women's basketball is enjoying a surge of popularity -- even eclipsing men's hoops at times.\n\nLast month's women's national championship game between the University of South Carolina and the University of Iowa was the most-watched basketball game -- including the NBA -- since 2019.\n\nLuxury fashion houses requested to dress players for the recent WNBA draft. Star rookies like Clark, Reese, Cameron Brink and others are already mainstays in national commercials, as are veterans such as the Seattle Storm's Jewell Lloyd (catch her repping State Farm) and the now-retired Sue Bird.\n\nSo if you're one of the new WNBA fans who doesn't quite know where to start following the league, you're in luck. Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Sports Basketball Armed Forces Politics Trade Entertainment Advertising Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

One particular moment has become the talk of social media.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Clark pulled off a step-back hesi three-point shot in one of the highlights of game.

The good news for the Fever is that the result will not hurt the team in the standings.

They're going to beat you on a whatever [the play] is.

Over the last couple years, it (the popularity) has grown and grown,\" Clark said.\n\n\"For them to come out and support me in my first WNBA game is really special, not only for myself but both teams on the court. They get to see how good this product is. You couldn't ask for a better game really for women's basketball to kick off this year, first game coming down to the wire, both teams competing. That's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nOf course, even though it was a preseason game, Clark, who played only five minutes in the third quarter after picking up her fourth foul, realizes despite her successful debut, there's plenty for her to work on, namely the five turnovers she committed in the 79-76 loss, which came on a last-second 3-pointer by Dallas' Arike Ogunbowale, a perennial WNBA All-Star.\n\n\"I think I did pretty well. Definitely could have taken care of the ball a little bit better,\" Clark said. \"I think all of us could have done a better job of that, (we had) too many turnovers (17). Overall, I think I played really hard and executed. I think overall, I came in here and played hard. That's always something to be proud of.\"\n\nWhen she was introduced in pregame introductions, the ex-Hawkeye superstar drew a huge ovation. And when Clark hit her first of five 3-pointers in the first quarter, the crowd was equally ecstatic in what was an electric atmosphere for the entire evening, something she definitely appreciated.\n\n\"I think just the atmosphere (is what I'll remember most),\" Clark said. \"Getting to put on your jersey for the first time for a real game is something that's super special. I remember my first game in college really well and know I'll remember my first game in the W really well, whether it's preseason or our first game at Connecticut. It's a big milestone for somebody that's always dreamed of playing in the WNBA.\"\n\n\"The crowd was great all night. That's what you expect with a sellout. Those are going to be the same with crowds all year. Whether they're cheering for you or against you, you better get used to it. It's always just a fun environment to play in.\"\n\nFever teammate Grace Berger knew Clark well before she even joined the Fever, after playing against her on several occasions during her collegiate career at Big Ten rival Indiana. And now that Berger, who is entering her second season in the league, is teammates with the biggest name in women's basketball these days, she's happy to see the added attention given to her team.\n\n\"I think it's great not only for our team, but the WNBA just to bring more eyes to it. I think once we get people to actually watch the WNBA, they'll keep coming back once they realize what a good product it is,\" Berger said.\n\nOgunbowale's final 3 of the evening came with three seconds left and the Fever immediately took their final timeout. With the ball automatically advanced to midcourt, second-year Indiana head coach Christie Sides drew up a play to get Clark the final shot to potentially send the game to overtime. Clark misfired from 25 feet, but her new coach has no reservations about calling her number in similar late-game situations in the future.\n\n\"She's a player that has ice in her veins. That's who she is, she's someone who is confident she's going to make those shots,\" Sides said.\n\nWhen asked what major differences she immediately noticed about the WNBA compared to college, Clark cited the more physical play right off the bat and needing to maintain focus on every possession.\n\n\"It comes down to every single possession. When you're on the court with this much talent, you can't take a second off,\" she said. \"You relax for one second and they're going to beat you on a screen, beat you on whatever it is. You cannot relax in this league for one second.\"\n\nHowever, when asked if she's feels more pressure to succeed as a professional, she offered a response very fitting of her calm, cool and collected demeanor.\n\n\"Yeah, the pressure has always been there whether I've been in college or now that I'm starting my WNBA career. Going to go about the same way I always do, just prepare the same way,\" Clark said.\n\nCaitlin Clark's first game as a professional was truly a special evening, that rare occasion in the sports world where the actual event delivered on the immense hype surrounding it, but many have a feeling it will be the first of many for this uber-talented former Hawkeye.", "source": {"uri": "thegazette.com",

But, Clark, who was the first overall pick in last month's draft, shined as expected, scoring 21 points.\n\nClark took to Instagram on Sunday evening and had a two-word message about her debut along with some awesome photos of the action:\n\nThe game was played in front of a sold-out crowd at the College Park Center in Arlington, Texas, much in part to Clark's presence. The former Iowa star has skyrocketed the popularity of women's basketball over the last year after her historic college career, recently breaking the NCAA's scoring record a few months ago.\n\nCaitlin Clark showcasing her talent\n\nWhile it was just one game so far, Clark showed why she's expected to be a superstar in the WNBA. The rookie was 5 for 13 from three-point land while grabbing three rebounds and dishing out two assists. Most of her damage came in the first half, scoring 16 points before the break.\n\nClark seemed content with how she played. Via The Athletic:\n\n\"My biggest goal coming into tonight was being myself, have fun playing basketball, be aggressive. Thought that's what I did,\" Clark said Friday in a post-game press conference.\n\n\"I thought we played really hard. Just a great atmosphere for women's basketball,\" Clark said postgame on the Bally Sports broadcast. \"I think it's a good kickoff to the WNBA season.\"\n\nBut, it wasn't all positive for Caitlin Clark. She also had five turnovers and four fouls, which is why she didn't play a lot in the third quarter. After all, this is a different level than college and there will be a small adjustment period for the sharpshooter.\n\n\"Overall, a lot to learn from,\" Clark said. \"These are good learning experiences for us. This doesn't count. Go back and watch the film, film doesn't lie and learn from that.\"\n\nClark had an opportunity to tie the game at the buzzer from deep, but missed the contested three. She saw some great things from the Fever but also some areas the squad needs to work on:\n\n\"I think just the little things. Knowing when to push in transition, knowing when to slow up and run our offense a little bit better,\" Clark added. \"Overall our defense was pretty good, I thought we could've gotten better in some areas. I thought we could've passed the ball a little bit better but overall, you know a lot to learn from. These are good learning experiences for us, you know this doesn't count. Go back and watch some film - film doesn't lie - and learn from that.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark will officially make her WNBA regular season debut on Tuesday, May 14th against the Connecticut Sun. Prior to that, Clark and the Fever have one more preseason matchup on Friday, May 10th against the Atlanta Dream.\n\nWe'll see if Clark can ball out again and limit the mistakes as she continues to get accustomed to the WNBA.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quinn_allen@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Quinn Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clarks-2-word-message-after-making-WNBA-preseason-debut.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2626, "textEnd": 2634}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 2742, "textEnd": 2750}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Celebrities are wearing Indiana Fever jerseys. Google searches for the league are higher than ever.\n\nEveryone is talking about the WNBA. And the hype is real.\n\nSpearheaded by the star power of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other top college players, women's basketball is enjoying a surge of popularity -- even eclipsing men's hoops at times.\n\nLast month's women's national championship game between the University of South Carolina and the University of Iowa was the most-watched basketball game -- including the NBA -- since 2019.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Star rookies like Clark, Reese, Cameron Brink and others are already mainstays in national commercials, as are veterans such as the Seattle Storm's Jewell Lloyd (catch her repping State Farm) and the now-retired Sue Bird.\n\nSo if you're one of the new WNBA fans who doesn't quite know where to start following the league, you're in luck. Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nPro Sports WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Sports

Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nProfessional WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Be

Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nProfessional WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I Tags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Sports Basketball Armed Forces Politics Trade

The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Star rookies like Clark, Reese, Cameron Brink and others are already mainstays in national commercials, as are veterans such as the Seattle Storm's Jewell Lloyd (catch her repping State Farm) and the now-retired Sue Bird.\n\nSo if you're one of the new WNBA fans who doesn't quite know where to start following the league, you're in luck. Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nProfessional WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Be

Clark started with a girl's orange WNBA shirt near the baseline and worked her way through the crowd in a video that gained 242,600 views and counting by May 4.\n\n\"I think the fans are always ... they're what makes women's basketball so fun,\" Clark told reporters after the game. \"I think over the course of the last couple of years, it's just grown and grown.\"\n\n\"And, you know, for them to come out and support during my first WNBA game is really special not only for myself, but, you know, both teams on the court,\" Clark added. \"They get to see how good this product is.\"\n\nClark delivered with 21 points on 6-15 shooting with three rebounds, two assists, and two steals in 28 minutes of action. She had a chance to tie the game at the buzzer but missed her 25-foot three-pointer at the end.\n\n\"And, I mean, you couldn't ask for a better game really. For women's basketball like to kick off this year like just a tremendous game coming down to the wire [and] both teams competing,\" Clark said. \"And, you know, that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nDespite being a preseason game, Arlington's College Park Center had a capacity crowd of 7,000 fans that night. The Fever take the court again in preseason action on May 9 at home against the Atlanta Dream.\n\n\"The crowd was great all night. That's what you expect with a sellout,\" Clark said. \"Those are going to be the same for the crowds all year long. So whether they're cheering for you or cheering against you, you'd better get used to it.\"\n\nInterest around Clark's preseason debut stemmed from her growing stardom during her recent college career at Iowa. Her dynamic play propelled the Hawkeyes to back-to-back Final Four appearances, and Clark captured the NCAA's all-time career scoring record along the way.\n\n\"My biggest goal coming into tonight was to continue to be myself, have fun playing basketball, be aggressive - I thought that's what I did. So, I think [I have] a lot to be proud of,\" Clark said.\n\nClark soaked in her first game as a pro. It was a long time coming as Clark wrote down playing in the WNBA as one of her goals in elementary school, which she shared on the TODAY show in April.\n\n\"Getting to put on your jersey for the first time for a real game is something that's super special. . . . It's a big milestone for someone that always dreamed of playing in the WNBA,\" Clark told reporters on May 3.\n\nFor her first WNBA shot and basket, she electrified the crowd with a deep three-pointer in the first quarter.\n\n\"I was able to get a pretty clean look for my first shot,\" Clark said. \"It's always nice to see your first shot go in when you're a shooter.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_davis@heavy.com", "name": "Matthew Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clark-5-e1714851240820.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 148, "textEnd": 153, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 536}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1603, "textEnd": 1608}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Whether or not she will be a player great enough to define her own era of women's professional basketball is yet to be seen. What we do know is that the WNBA now has a draw, unlike anything the league has ever seen before.\n\nCaitlin Clark made her professional debut in front of a sold-out crowd in Dallas on Friday. Despite it being a preseason game that did not count towards the actual league standings, Caitlin Clark once again helped generate a sellout crowd on the road in Texas. All 6,251 seats were filled, an increase from Dallas' average attendance last year of 4,641 per game.\n\nThough her team lost 79-76 to the Wings, Clark showed everyone in attendance and watching at home why she was the easy No. 1 overall pick. Clark's 21 points were tied for the top scorer in the game alongside fellow rookie Jaelyn Brown. She added three rebounds and two assists to go with her two steals.\n\nIt wasn't completely perfect, but there was a lot to be excited about in Caitlin Clark's debut game. The supreme shot creation that helped her become the all-time Division I scoring leader at Iowa looks like it will definitely translate to the WNBA. Clark is already making tough threes before the regular season begins.\n\nClark didn't have the assist totals that she had at Iowa, but considering she just legitimately joined the team a few weeks ago, it's going to take some time before she really gets on the same page with her new teammates. She also has to learn a new system for the first time since she was a freshman at Iowa, too.\n\nWhat will be interesting to see is how Clark molds her style to the talent around her. She is now surrounded by professional athletes.

Instead, it highlights how one played before a national audience, while the other, who is just as polarizing and has as much reason to be broadcast nationally, did not.\n\nHere is the breakdown from sportswriter Chris Phelps, who pointed out the league's odd programing choice via Athlon Sports:\n\nThe Chicago Sky vs. Minnesota Lynx preseason game was not streamed online by the WNBA. ... unlike what the league did with the Caitlin Clark debut for the Indiana Fever, with that Friday night debut in Dallas a cause celebre.\n\nMany are ripping the WNBA for this imbalanced decision. Clark's game was televised and coverage easy to access. Reese's game, not so much.\n\nLike Ervin \"Magic\" Johnson's historic rivalry versus Larry \"Legend\" Bird, race has played a role in the polarizing nature of this rivalry and the way fans on each side have dug in. Some feel racism powered the move to highlight Clark -- college hoops' all-time leading scorer -- while censoring her nemesis.\n\n\"The WNBA is wild embarrassing. To not have Angel Reese and Kamila Cordossa games on the league pass is insane. Angel Reese is one of the reasons why women's basketball is getting so much attention but they made sure to put the white girl front and center, I'm tired of them,\" wrote one WNBA fan via X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\"The fact that the only WNBA game televised was the Indiana Fever game is a slap in the face to every woman in the league, but what it really shows is the racism in all of this,\" wrote another.\n\nPerception isn't always reality but these fans make a good point.\n\nClark, who was drafted No. 1 by the Indiana Fever on April 15 could become the face of the WNBA, and for good reason after Clark was a two-time Sullivan Award winner given to the country's most outstanding athlete in college or Olympics.\n\nDespite Clark's prowess, Reese, who was selected by the Chicago Sky with the seventh overall pick and has as much marketability, beat Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes in the 2023 national championship game before Clark returned the favor in the national semi-final this year.

Fans have flocked to her games in person and on TV because of her charisma.\n\nThe National Championship game between the Hawkeyes and South Carolina had 24 million combined viewers on ESPN and ABC -- the first time in history that a women's final drew a larger TV audience than the men's, according to ESPN.\n\nNow, expectations are that Clark will have the same impact on the WNBA and it's already trending in that direction.\n\nClark finished her college career as the top scorer in the history of men's and women's college basketball with 3,951 points and was a two-time NCAA women's basketball Player of the Year. She finished with the highest career scoring average (28.42) in Division I history, passing Patricia Hoskins of Mississippi Valley State.\n\nLast season as a senior, Clark averaged 31.6 points, 8.9 assists, and 7.4 rebounds per game, leading Division I in scoring and assists. The Hawkeyes retired her No. 22 jersey number, making her the third player in program history to receive the honor.\n\nThere will inevitably be some growing pains in the WNBA. The speed and physicality of the pro game are more intense than at the college level. However, Clark still shined in her debut and much of the sold-out crowd in Texas were at the game to cheer for her, rather than the home team.\n\nAttendance and television ratings for the WNBA were already trending upward even before Clark was selected by Indiana. The league has its most-watched season in 21 years, averaging 462,000 viewers per game across its affiliates, ABC, ESPN, and CBS.\n\nTeams are already preparing for the Clark effect when they host Indiana. For example, the Las Vegas Aces, the two-time reigning WNBA champions, relocated their game on May 25 from the 12,000-seat Michelob Ultra Arena to the 18,000-seat T-Mobile Arena to meet demand. In addition, the Washington Mystics moved their June 7 game against Indiana to Capital One Arena, which has a capacity of 20,356, from their normal home, the Entertainment and Sports Arena, which can host 4,200 fans.\n\nFor Clark, she is just focused on playing basketball. She is looking for continued improvement before the regular-season opener against Connecticut on May 14.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"},

For those who do not know, \"bae\" is a phrase used to refer to a significant other that is short for \"babe\" or \"baby.\"\n\nReporter: \"Is bae gonna be here?\"\n\nCaitlin Clark: \"Huh, no. He's working... I'm flying solo. Guess I better get used to it, right?\"?\n\nFans took to the comment section as well as the quotes to put that reporter on blast:\n\nColumnist Gregg Doyel of the Indianapolis Star drew criticism a little over two weeks ago for what he called a \"clumsy and awkward\" exchange with Clark, during which he made a heart gesture and said she ought to do it to him.\n\nAlso Read: WNBA Accused Of Racism After Perplexing Decision On Caitlin Clark & Angel Reese Debuts\n\nShe's been a tremendous on-court athlete with Iowa and is now set to be one of the best young players with the Indiana Fever in the league, and yet the reporters who are tasked with covering her are making things incredibly awkward.\n\nCaitlin Clark scored 21 points in her WNBA debut with the Indiana Fever and quickly showed her talent is certainly going to translate to the pros.\n\nClark had a good game, but the Dallas Wings prevailed 79-76 in the preseason opener for both teams.

Celebrities are wearing Indiana Fever jerseys. Google searches for the league are higher than ever.\n\nEveryone is talking about the WNBA. And the hype is real.\n\nSpearheaded by the star power of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other top college players, women's basketball is enjoying a surge of popularity -- even eclipsing men's hoops at times.\n\nLast month's women's national championship game between the University of South Carolina and the University of Iowa was the most-watched basketball game -- including the NBA -- since 2019.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Star rookies like Clark, Reese, Cameron Brink and others are already mainstays in national commercials, as are veterans such as the Seattle Storm's Jewell Lloyd (catch her repping State Farm) and the now-retired Sue Bird.\n\nSo if you're one of the new WNBA fans who doesn't quite know where to start following the league, you're in luck. Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nProfessional WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I Tags Dcc Wire Lee-natiional Sports Basketball Armed Forces Politics Trade

So was Angel Reese's debut, right? Unfortunately, fans couldn't find it on the WNBA League Pass. There's a reason for that.\n\nThe WNBA didn't stream Reese's debut. It was a shockingly bad omission by the league. Reese is easily the second biggest name in women's college basketball right now behind No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark. The WNBA clearly feels differently, though.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Is All Over Social Media After College GPA Surfaces\n\nA fan in attendance live-streamed the Chicago Sky's preseason game on their iPhone, and it reportedly had hundreds of thousands of viewers. The WNBA dropped the ball, and that's a pretty disappointing development for WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu.\n\nIonescu slammed the WNBA for the oversight and called for better representation of all its players during the New York Liberty's Media Day on Saturday.\n\n\"I mean, it sucks,\" Ionescu said. \"I think representation of every team is important. ... Hopefully, the league can fix that because I think they dropped the ball on that part and hopefully they have a great explanation as to why that wasn't televised. But hats off to the person that just figured it out.\"\n\nThe WNBA now has its own stars calling the league out because coverage is sub par. See the problem?\n\nThe WNBA has long asked for fans to pay more attention to the league. Better exposure means more money, and more money means a better product. But the WNBA has to hold up its end of the bargain by providing league-wide access, even if it's only the preseason.\n\nAngel Reese deserves better. Hopefully, Ionescu's message to the WNBA turns a few heads and sparks change.\n\nRelated: WNBA Star Sabrina Ionescu's Four-Word Message to 'Close' Friend Caitlin Clark", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alek_arend@postandcourier.com", "name": "Alek Arend", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/4d/04de3bdd-d726-591b-835b-167b8e502315/6637b18725639.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

However, the WNBA seems unprepared for the occasion. Despite the much anticipated WNBA debut's of four highly rated rookies, only Caitlin Clark and Jacy Sheldon were featured in live broadcasts via the WNBA app and WNBA League Pass on Friday night. Kamilla Cardoso and Angel Reese, who also debuted on Friday evening, missed out on live coverage, leaving viewers to turn to a fan's cellphone livestream of the game from the stands. This disparity, along with issues such as a lack of charter team flights and arena scheduling conflicts, highlights the WNBA's apparent lack of readiness to fully capitalize on the \"Caitlin Clark effect.\"\n\nFans who had been eager to witness the WNBA preseason debuts of star rookie Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso were met with disappointment when the game was not accessible through the WNBA League Pass. However, a resourceful solution emerged: nearly 1 million viewers tuned in via a fan's livestream on X, captured on her cellphone by user, @heyheyitsalli. By midnight, the video post had garnered over 800,000 views and been shared more than 2,300 times.\n\nFollowing the disappointment experienced by fans, Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve addressed the use of a livestream in the absence of televised coverage. \"The pace of growth is remarkable, it's exponential. The old ways won't suffice anymore; you risk being left behind,\" Reeve remarked on the league's broadcasting constraints. \"This incident serves as a case in point. We must seize such opportunities.\"\n\nUpon entering the WNBA, numerous stars face a significant adjustment: transitioning from the ease of private flights during their collegiate careers to the rigors of commercial air travel throughout the WNBA regular season. This shift raises serious concerns regarding safety, well-being, and logistical challenges for WNBA teams. So far this season, notable players like Caitlin Clark have encountered their first taste of navigating crowded airports, contending with a barrage of media attention and airport passengers capturing photos and videos as they traverse through terminals, exemplifying the unique challenges faced by WNBA athletes.\n\nWNBA teams continue to face scheduling conflicts for games and practice given the lack of solely WNBA team venues. Most recently, the Indiana Fever had to move their sold-out pre-season home opener up one day to accommodate the Indiana Pacers playoff schedule. Nearly 17,000 fans will need to adjust their schedules in order to attend the game, a significant inconvenience and one that effects the overall legitimacy of the league.\n\nThe lack of preparedness from the WNBA to capitalize on the Caitlin Clark Effect presents several damaging implications for the growth and sustainability of women's sports", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacy_Sheldon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacy Sheldon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Reeve", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheryl Reeve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Lynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Lynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6636a7aca7a4dfae1f9657a7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Celebrities are wearing Indiana Fever jerseys. Google searches for the league are higher than ever.\n\nEveryone is talking about the WNBA. And the hype is real.\n\nSpearheaded by the star power of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other top college players, women's basketball is enjoying a surge of popularity -- even eclipsing men's hoops at times.\n\nLast month's women's national championship game between the University of South Carolina and the University of Iowa was the most-watched basketball game -- including the NBA -- since 2019.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Ahead of the league's preseason, which tipped off Friday, here's your guide to all things WNBA.\n\nWhy is the WNBA getting all this new attention?\n\nFor a league that has largely been overshadowed by the NBA, the last few months have been a publicity avalanche, the likes of which the WNBA hasn't seen since its inaugural year in 1997.\n\nWNBA games have long drawn fewer eyes and earned less revenue than games in the NBA. The league's players are less visible than their male counterparts, who have parlayed their fame into fashion endorsements, production companies and whatever other creative endeavors to which millionaires may aspire.\n\nTo say all of that is changing may be an overstatement for a league whose average salary hovers around $130,000 and whose teams still fly commercial (the average NBA salary is $9.5 million, and teams travel via private charter). And though 2023 saw a rise in WNBA attendance, average attendance is still only 6,615 people per game, compared to the NBA's average of 18,324.\n\nNational WNBA ticket sales on StubHub are up 93%. Aces, Caitlin Clark and returning stars fuel rise By The Associated Press\n\nBut there is certainly a buzz, a feeling that tides could be shifting. WNBA sales this year on StubHub have spiked by 93% compared to the 2023 season. At last month's draft, \"the excitement was palpable,\" Candace Pedraza, who covers the league for WNBA news website Winsidr, told CNN.\n\nThanks to the recent changes allowing college students to profit from advertising and endorsements, women's basketball stars now appear in commercials while they're still in college, cultivating interest in their careers before they even turn pro. (Just look at Brink, who starred in New Balance ads while still at Stanford, alongside NBA stars Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard.)\n\nThe WNBA also has plans to add four more teams by 2028, and recently raised $75 million from investors to help \"drive the league's brand,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said.\n\nAnd with the influx of new talent entering the league, joining existing stars like two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, the WNBA seems poised for a breakout year.\n\nWhen does the WNBA season start?\n\nTipoff for this year's regular season is May 14, but the preseason started Friday, with Reese's Chicago Sky and Clark's Indiana Fever both in action. Fans can watch the league, colloquially known as the W, on either local channels or on WNBA League Pass. Some games may be nationally broadcast via ESPN, ION, Prime Video, or even X.\n\nSo far, there are 12 teams in the W -- Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm and Washington Mystics -- divided into two conferences, East and West, much like the NBA.\n\nThe WNBA began play in 1997 but was not the first women's professional basketball league. That was the American Basketball League, which launched in 1996 -- a year after the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, led by star Rebecca Lobo, went undefeated, boosting interest in the women's game and support for a professional women's league. The ABL competed head-to-head with the WNBA for a year before folding in 1998.\n\nThe WNBA was the first league formed in partnership with the NBA, and was dominated early on by the now-defunct Houston Comets, who won the first four WNBA titles. To this day, many WNBA teams share the same ownership as their NBA affiliate, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx, and the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury.\n\nHow is the WNBA different from the NBA?\n\nThe women play 40 games in the regular season, which ends in September, rather than 82 for the men. The W season begins as the NBA is deep into its playoffs. And the WNBA features a slightly smaller ball.\n\nIn addition, the style of play in the two leagues is quite different.\n\nWhile NBA games tend to be heavy on three-point shooting, the W is more \"technically sound,\" Pedraza said.\n\n\"If you're a fan of the fundamentals of basketball, like protecting the ball, sharing the ball, things of that nature, you're going to love watching WNBA,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, there's also more action in the paint -- near the basket -- rather than around the perimeter by the three-point line, though she noted that with long-range shooters like Clark entering the league, that could shift.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBusiness Oregon's Sports Bra, a pub for women's sports fans, plans national expansion as interest booms CLAIRE RUSH Associated Press\n\nThe NBA can sometimes devolve into a three-point shooting contest, while the women's game tends to be more of a physical battle in the paint, which can mean more highlight-reel blocked shots.\n\nAnd yet the league still does not always receive the same respect as the men's. After a claim that a high school boy's team could defeat the WNBA champion Aces went viral last year, 76ers guard Patrick Beverley defended the WNBA, saying they are \"way more physical\" than the men's league.\n\n\"They hit you more. They screen harder. They hold their screens,\" he said on a podcast. \"It's a physical-a*s game.\"\n\nThe game is also shorter, with games divided into four 10-minute quarters versus the NBA's 48-minute games. So when you see, for example, the Connecticut Sun's Alyssa Thomas recording back-to-back triple doubles, with less time to work with than the men, Pedraza said, \"you can be doubly impressed.\"\n\nWho are the WNBA players and teams to watch?\n\nIn the last few years, the Las Vegas Aces have become something of a superteam, having won the championship in both 2022 and 2023. But a rivalry has been forming between the Aces and New York Liberty, who lost to them in the finals last season.\n\nThe Aces are led by A'ja Wilson -- arguably the league's top player -- while the Liberty counter with star Breanna Stewart and sharpshooter Sabrina Ionescu, who narrowly lost to NBA great Steph Curry in a 3-point contest during the NBA's All-Star Weekend in February.\n\nNeither team made any huge moves in the off-season, Pedraza noted, betting on their existing players. But other teams have been making moves.\n\nLook out for the Seattle Storm, Pedraza said. The Storm already have Jewell Lloyd -- who leads the league in scoring -- and picked up two more offensive weapons: former MVP Nneka Ogwumike, who was the league's fifth-leading scorer in 2022, and six-time All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\"That's like a three-headed monster when it comes to scoring,\" Pedraza said.\n\nAnother team on the rise is the Phoenix Mercury, who acquired guard Rebecca Allen (Pedraza calls her \"a secret sniper\" for her underrated scoring abilities) and Kahleah Copper, MVP of the 2021 Finals.\n\nThe Mercury also re-signed former defensive player of the year Brittney Griner, who returned to the WNBA last spring after spending nearly 10 months in Russian custody on drug-smuggling charges after authorities there found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\n\"They're not the only high-caliber teams in the W anymore,\" Pedraza said, speaking of the Aces and the Liberty. \"Talent has definitely distributed itself.\"\n\nHasn't the WNBA faced some controversies?\n\nOne of the thorniest challenges facing the W has involved the race and sexuality of its players. The W is primarily made up of women of color -- more than 60% of players are Black -- and many, though estimates vary, are LGBTQ.\n\nThough now retired, WNBA legend Sue Bird has been open about how she was forced into the closet when she entered the league in 2002. To be successful, she was told, she'd have to cosplay as heterosexual. Bird has since been outspoken about how the W is not as popular as women's soccer, in part because many of its basketball players are Black and gay.\n\n\"Women's soccer players generally are cute little White girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes,\" Bird told CNN in 2020. \"A lot of Black, gay, tall women ... There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.\"\n\nOnly in the last few years has the WNBA embraced its LGBTQ players and fans. But Black players are still not always celebrated the same way as White ones, Pedraza said.\n\nFor example, the Aces' Wilson, who is Black, lost the 2023 WNBA MVP award to the Liberty's Stewart, who is White -- an outcome that surprised many observers.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that was a little egregious,\" Pedraza said, clarifying that she doesn't necessarily agree or disagree with the decision. \"But that was just one thing that happened last year that folks on that team felt like, 'this is just another example of (Wilson) being shunned by media and by voters who would rather lift up this White player.'\"\n\nThe WNBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nSome observers believe the attention showered on Caitlin Clark has illuminated this perceived double standard, particularly when compared to her Black counterparts like Reese -- who bested Clark in the 2023 national title game. Before entering the league Clark appeared in State Farm commercials and received a signature shoe deal with Nike.\n\nThe only other WNBA players who currently have a signature shoe deal? Stewart, Ionescu and the the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne, all of whom are White.\n\nUSA Today columnist Mike Freeman recently highlighted this racial disparity, writing: \"The fact that only white women hold the power of the signature shoe now, as the WNBA enters its most high profile and prosperous phase, shows how Black women are being ignored in a league that they dominate.\"\n\nAs the WNBA tips off its season, the league may have eyes on it like never before. It could be a legacy-defining season for women's basketball -- akin to the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry of the 1980s, which reignited the then-struggling NBA. Or it could be another incremental step towards greater visibility and compensation for women athletes.\n\nEither way, for many fans it'll be must-see viewing. Here's the full schedule.\n\nPhotos: Iowa's Caitlin Clark becomes the All-time leading scorer in NCAA Women's Division I Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-natiional Sports

But aside from Clark, another rookie is expected to make her preseason debut tonight, Angel Reese. Unfortunately, the game between the Chicago Sky and Minnesota Lynx won't be available on TV.\n\nBoth Clark and Reese will suit up for their respective teams and show off in the preseason. But many have called out the league for allegedly prioritizing the debut of the top pick. The Indiana Fever will take on the Dallas Wings tonight and fans will get to watch the game on TV and the WNBA League Pass.\n\nWith that, the fans have criticized the league for this issue. But they cleared the air on social media earlier. According to the league, Bally Sports of Minnesota has scheduled an MLB game for the timeslot of Reese's preseason debut.\n\nThey clarified that they do not have control over the game not being available for fans on TV. At the end of their statement, the league assured fans that all games would be available in the league pass.\n\nWith Clark and Reese being two of the best college players as of late, it's no surprise that both of them have garnered attention. There are significant expectations for both rookies as they start their professional careers.\n\nAlso read: Where to watch Indiana Fever vs Dallas Wings 2024 WNBA Preseason Game? Date, time and streaming options\n\nFans caught sight of Clark at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport with her teammates on Thursday. This was in preparation for the team's preseason game against the Wings. The viewers immediately pointed out how the WNBA wasn't flying the team on a charter flight.\n\nThe issue of the league not having charter flights for teams resurfaced after this. During her media availability, Clark commented on it and mentioned that it'll take time for her to adjust to flying commercial.\n\n\"It'll definitely be an adjustment, but it is what it is,\" Clark said.\n\n\"It's not like we're the odd man out here. Everybody has to navigate it and I think it's going to cause some problems, maybe, because the popularity of our league is continuing to grow and having to navigate travel with that.\"\n\nThe issue of the teams in the league not having a charter flight has been around for some time. Fans have pointed out that there could be safety issues that the players could face. For the Fever, general manager Lin Dunn assured fans that the team has security measures in place.\n\nAccording to Fox News, the league spent $4 million on charter flights during the playoffs last year. This also included back-to-back games that happened during the regular season. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert shared before the 2024 draft that the league would do the same this season.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reign_amurao@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Reign Amurao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Lynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Lynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Fort_Worth_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Fort Worth International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Dunn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lin Dunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web_Applications", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web Applications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/a800b-17147781515974-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He had only one word in response to Clark's stellar performance.\n\n\"Respect.\"\n\nIn a video posted to his X account, Brown was seen in the stands watching as Clark walked into the locker room after the game. He was also seen holding what appears to be a white t-shirt, possibly mimicking a white flag as he surrenders that Clark lived up to the hype.\n\nIt's good to see Brown change his tone on Clark. His previous comments were a completely unjustified attempt to tear down the new face of the WNBA for seemingly no reason.\n\nBut after watching her play, even Brown couldn't deny Clark's talent. He even said that Clark's team, the Indiana Fever, gained a new fan because of her performance.\n\nWhile the sting of his previous comments may remain, at least Brown had the decency to respect Clark instead of continuing to attack her.\n\nIt's also remarkable that Clark, still just 22 years-old, had the maturity to refrain from engaging with Brown -- instead letting her game do the talking.\n\nShe's hasn't let the pressure of becoming the WNBA's brightest star get to her, as her debut performance showed.\n\nBrown's turnaround shows the effect that Clark is having on the WNBA. Her talent, poise and maturity have made it so that you can't help but be a fan of hers.\n\nAs her WNBA career takes off, the sky is the limit for the young superstar.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_altomari@westernjournal.com", "name": "Anthony Altomari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Clark-v-Brown.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Anyone? Of course y'all did! It's 2024. You ALWAYS take the under when it comes to race-baiting. It took exactly one day for WNBA fans to play the race card.\n\nFor those who missed it, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese both made their WNBA debuts last night. Oh? You didn't spend your Friday nights watching WNBA preseason games? Well, shame on you!\n\nPlenty of folks did. Clark's Indiana Fever debut in Dallas was pretty damn packed - if not completely sold out - and those who didn't/couldn't attend watched the game on WNBA League Pass.\n\nNow, for those who wanted to watch Reese make her debut with the Chicago Sky, it wasn't quite as easy. And by that, I mean they had to watch through a Twitter live stream, courtesy of someone's cell phone camera in the bleachers.\n\nObjectively, that's funny. Sorry, but it is. Could you imagine sitting around a tiny screen and watching a WNBA game being live-streamed on a cell phone?\n\nApparently, not everyone thought it was funny. Predictably, plenty of woke progressives thought it was racist!\n\nWhen in doubt, play the race card. A sure-fire way to grab attention in 2024.\n\nGuys, come on. Do you really think the WNBA is out to get Angel Reese? I mean, come on. Can we just act normal for two seconds?\n\nOf course they're not! In what world would that be a smart business decision? This is pretty much the last best chance the WNBA has to become relevant.\n\nThis infusion of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese - and others - is a gift from the heavens that the WNBA desperately needed. It's like finding a winning lotto ticket floating in the water while you're living under a bridge.\n\nWhy in the hell would they jeopardize that one Day 1, Game 1, of the 2024 season? Come on.\n\nNow, do I know exactly why the Indiana Fever game was shown and NOT the Chicago Sky game? Some on social media have said it's a Bally Sports issue, which wouldn't surprise me because Bally is generally awful.\n\nI've seen this tweet making the rounds, but really haven't seen it verified anywhere, so you'll have to take it with a grain of salt:\n\nNo clue if that was the case, but it doesn't really matter. That's not the point here. I don't want to get into the intricacies of what can and can't be streamed, how it works, who owns what - I don't care. That's a WNBA problem to deal with. It's a separate story entirely.\n\nBut calling the WNBA racist for promoting the BIGGEST NAME IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL is silly. Here's the truth: if Caitlin Clark were black, this wouldn't be an issue. But because she's white, there's always a conspiracy theory. Always.\n\nAgain, when in doubt, play the race card. Seems silly to play it against the WNBA, which is one of the wokest leagues in all the land, but hey, sometimes you have to launch a Hail Mary. The wokes always turn on their own. Don't forget it.\n\nThere was no conspiracy. There is no conspiracy. The WNBA made a business decision to promote Caitlin Clark last night, and it would've been insane not to.\n\nThere's a reason tickets for Clark's opener in Dallas were going for over $100 last night.

It doesn't seem like it. Clark dominates on the court and in the classroom, as evidenced by her college GPA.\n\nClark became the NCAA's all-time leading scorer during his final season with the Iowa Hawkeyes earlier this year. She fell short of her lofty goal to win a national title, though, falling to No. 1 seed South Carolina in the tournament final.\n\nThe Indiana Fever then selected Clark with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft. She made her WNBA preseason debut on Friday night, scoring 21 points (five 3PM) in the Fever's 79-76 defeat.

The basketball superstar posted a 3.64 GPA at The University of Iowa.\n\nHowever, Clark still has yet to finish her degree, putting her Olympic status in question for the time being.\n\n\"I would love to be on the Olympic team, and be in Paris,\" Clark said. \"But that's not up to me. I actually still need to earn my degree, too; I need to graduate college first, or else my mom might kill me.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark is a marketing major at Iowa. That's not an easy degree to obtain, further proving how impressive it is she was able to be the best player in women's college basketball while dominating in the classroom.\n\nFunny enough, it sounds like she still has to manage her basketball life with her studies. Clark aims to finish her degree before summer rolls around to then be able to compete in the Olympics.\n\nLet's be honest, though: Nothing is going to keep Clark from competing in the 2024 Paris Olympic games.

Despite Clark's rising popularity, she and her Fever teammates walked through the airport baggage claim as normal, at least based on video from WFAA's Matt Howerton. Clark appeared to have light security with her.\n\n\"Caitlin Clark is hopefully going to force the charter flight issue in the WNBA the way [Phoenix Mercury center] Brittney Griner did. It's about safety and player health,\" former ESPN anchor Jemele Hill posted Thursday on X, formerly Twitter, regarding WFAA's video.\n\n\"The WNBA only allows charter flights on back-to-backs during the regular season and in the postseason -- even though some teams have expressed a willingness to provide charter flights for their players the whole season,\" Hill added. \"The [New York] Liberty were fined $500K for against league rules and providing charters for their players [in 2022].\"\n\n\"It's weird prohibiting charter flights was even in the WNBA at all. It seems each team should have been allowed to make their own decision about this from the jump,\" Hill concluded.\n\nThe WNBA made one accommodation in April 2023 with the addition of charter planes during playoff time when back-to-back away games occur.\n\nClark, who only took charter flights with Iowa as a college basketball player, is quite aware of the issue. She recently weighed in on it via the Indianapolis Star.\n\n\"It's not like we're the odd man out here,\" Clark said via the Star on May 1. \"Everybody has to navigate it. And I think it's gonna, you know, cause some problems, maybe, because the popularity of our league is continuing to grow.\"\n\n\"Having to navigate travel with that, but at the same time, as you know, that's a positive thing; you want people to be excited about our game. So, hopefully it changes in the near future, but for now, it's just what it is,\" Clark added.\n\nClark and the Fever tip off the preseason on May 3 against the Dallas Wings in Arlington, Texas.\n\nClark isn't the first to say something about WNBA travel. Liberty forward Breanna Stewart got vocal about the commercial air travel last year after Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Greiner's alleged airport incident in June 2023.\n\n\"I think that there needs to be extra precautionary measures taken,\" Stewart told reporters in June 2023 via The New York Post. \"I don't think anyone is against BG having charter flights whenever she wants so that she can be herself and travel and be comfortable and be safe. Because that's the last thing we want is what happened [Saturday].\"\n\n\"If we have the owners who are willing to support it and do it, it's for the health and safety, to not only make sure we get from city to city without being harassed like BG was in the airport, but also making sure we are able to perform our best,\" Stewart added.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_davis@heavy.com", "name": "Matthew Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jemele Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFAA", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WFAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittney Griner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clark--e1714761026774.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 183, "textEnd": 188}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1757, "textEnd": 1762}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2203, "textEnd": 2208}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Nobody is shouting at Clark or any of her teammates in the clip, the players are just walking through the baggage claims area as all normal travelers do.\n\nWhile most would agree that it's unfortunate that WNBA players have to fly commercial - unless if it's a back-to-back situation when teams are allowed to charter flights - it's simply the reality the league is in at the moment.\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has made it clear that the league simply does not have the resources at the moment to allow teams to fly private if they want the league to have any type of future.\n\n\"There's no way any male sport has charter travel without a huge media rights deal,\" Engelbert told The Athletic in August 2023.\n\n\"You're not gonna jeopardize the financial stability of this league, I'm telling you. If the players got what they wanted right now -- look, I want it for them too -- but they're not going to have jobs in three to five years if we did it today,\" the commissioner continued.\n\nThe WNBA is set to see a huge funding boost when it signs a new media rights deal when its current contract expires at the end of 2025, but for right now, the league simply doesn't have the funds to fly teams around the country privately.\n\nThe WNBA's current TV media rights deal makes roughly $60 million annually. For comparison' sake, the NBA's current TV deal earns the league roughly $2.1 billion. That one example alone makes the situation abundantly clear as to just how small the WNBA, and the league's funds, are compared to the male side of professional basketball.\n\nOh, the WNBA is subsidized by the NBA, it is fully backed by the Association, which is important to remember in all of this as well.\n\nCaitlin Clark herself doesn't exactly care about having to fly commercially for the time being, either.\n\n\"Hopefully it changes in the near future, but for now that's just what it is. Everyone is dealing with the same thing so you can't use it as an excuse,\" Clark explained during a recent press conference.\n\nThe fact that the WNBA has explained why players can't fly privately at the moment or Clark shrugging the inconvenience off didn't stop the likes of Jemele Hill and others who have zero understanding of reality from whining about the situation.\n\nHill claiming Clark could force the WNBA's hand into allowing teams to fly private is rich given that if and when that change occurs and Clark is the face behind it, Hill will undoubtedly play the race card and say that 'it took a white girl' for the WNBA to allow players to ditch commercial travel.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and predict that Clark and her teammates can handle walking through the airport on their way to work like the rest of civilization.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemele Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/caitlin-clark-flying.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Disregard the age of the opponent, she's the best player on the floor, in a packed arena.\n\nOn Friday night at the College Park Center in Arlington on the campus of UTA, the Dallas Wings' WNBA team, thanks to some shrewd foresight, were the first team to host the Indiana Fever and the biggest thing to hit women's sports in this country ever.\n\nThis was not your standard preseason game. This felt like the playoffs, even if the players dismissed it as a scrimmage.\n\nClark's arrival to Arlington sold all 6,251 tickets for a game that normally is free. This was one of the Wings' two preseason games, and tickets for these exhibitions are typically giveaways.\n\nEven if it's a warmup, you don't give away tickets to watch Elvis in a recording session. On the secondary market, one ticket was going for $666 on the floor. The bad seats, which there are not many in this quaint arena, were going for about $75.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIn her first game as a pro, Caitlin did for the Indiana Fever what she did for the Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nClark led the Fever with 21 points, including those deep 3-pointers that made her a national name. The only hitch to this script was she missed a short bunny in the final minute, and after the Wings took the lead in the waning seconds, Clark's difficult game-tying 3-point shot from the deep corner was off.\n\nThe Wings won the game, 79-76, but this was a win for everyone.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better first game, really, for women's basketball,\" Clark said after the game. \"Tremendous game, down to the wire, both teams competing; that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIdeally.\n\nThere was not a single negative to be found here on Friday night, with one glaring exception. The WNBA needs more, real players. And until not only that happens, we have to get over all of this \"explosion\" talk surrounding this league, and women's sports.\n\nUntil we as a sports consuming culture focus on the performance rather than the \"movement\" of girls and women playing basketball, volleyball, softball, and anything else, we ain't there. Until the focus is primarily on the production of the player and coach and GM, rather than equality and Title IX, this is all in the development stages.\n\nThat's not an indictment on any woman playing these games but where America is in its evolution buying women's sports.\n\nBecause the concept of buying women's sports is still relatively new. Think 1990-ish as a launch date. The concept of a Caitlin Clark in 1985 was a fantasy.\n\nBe patient, people.\n\nThe first year of the NBA was in 1946-'47, but the league didn't find stability, and popularity, until the '80s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along. Before Magic and Bird, pro basketball was 30 years of small crowds, folding teams, and a product that was second tier behind baseball and football.\n\nThe WNBA's first season was in 1997, so you do the math.\n\nWe have a ways to go, but it's better than it's ever been, and Clark's arrival will eventually be viewed as a marker. Because she's a prodigy.\n\nShe's not Bird. She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA, and women's sports to \"make it,\" but Caitlin Clark is not marketing gimmick.\n\nIt's an organic creation that Americans want to buy, and she's worth the price.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0

Why Trust Us?\n\nWhile WNBA pre-season games have started, the official season doesn't kick off until May 14. Right before that is a key date: The final roster has to be cut down by May 13.\n\nYep, not everyone who is currently in the WNBA will actually stay in the pro league and some people who were drafted won't actually play a regular season game. Right now, the WNBA is in preseason, which is a good time for coaches and teams to see what does and doesn't work. But it also means that plenty of excellent players are on the chopping block.\n\nHere's what you need to know about WNBA roster cuts, plus who has already been let go.\n\nEach WNBA team has to have a minimum roster size of 11 players and a maximum roster size of 12 players, according to the WNBA's website. With 12 teams across the country, that's only a maximum of 144 spots to be filled by veterans and newbies, making the WNBA really, really competitive.\n\nUp to 18 players can sign with WNBA teams, but six will be cut. Given how short the turnaround is between the college season and start of the WNBA season, the whole thing is just tough, especially for newcomers.\n\nIn 2023, just 15 of those who were drafted into the WNBA made the final cut, according to the Indy Star. While the final cut day is still ahead, a lot of the big names who were drafted, including Caitlin Clark, Kamilla Cardoso, and Angel Reese are still in the mix, per CBS Sports.\n\nRookies Morgan Jones and Virag Kiss have been cut so far, but a lot of teams haven't made any cuts -- yet.\n\nIt's highly likely that Caitlin will start in the WNBA, given her level of talent and huge following. Caitlin just started in a preseason game against the Dallas Wings and scored 21 points, per ESPN.\n\n\"My biggest goal coming into tonight was to continue to be myself, play aggressive,\" she said afterward, per ESPN. \"I thought that's what I did. I think there's a lot to be proud of.\"\n\nIt depends. Again, the WNBA is incredibly competitive and it's really hard to make one of these spots.\n\n\"If you get cut after training camp, that does not mean you're not good,\" Atlanta Dream's Laeticia Amihere said in a recent TikTok. \"That does not mean that player sucks. Don't stop supporting that player.\"\n\nLaeticia also said that things like fit on a team and chemistry can play a role in who makes the final roster. That said, people who get cut can get snapped up by another team or could go overseas to play -- and overseas teams tend to pay higher salaries than they do in the U.S.\n\nThe good news in all of this is that WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert is talking about expanding and wants to have 16 WNBA teams by 2028 -- which, again is four more than currently exist, AP News says.\n\nThe WNBA season kicks off in less than two weeks -- and a lot can change before then.", "source": {"uri": "womenshealthmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/caitlin-clark-and-allyah-boston-of-the-indiana-fever-news-photo-1715011786.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0465xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 208, "textEnd": 214}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 288, "textEnd": 294}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Sheryl Swoopes' awkward interview with Caitlin Clark that fans didn't like: I could feel the tension\n\nThere is no doubt Caitlin Clark's ascension to the WNBA may have changed the game forever after a sharp rise in the league's popularity. But one basketball expert, Jason Whitlock, thinks her impact has been so vast that she could filter into the minds of NBA players too.\n\nFor decades, NBA players have been chosen as the face for sports brands and endorsing products for lucrative fees. But Clark, the No.1 pick for the 2024 WNBA Draft, is tearing up the status quo after her record-breaking stint in college basketball.\n\nThe 22-year-old, now playing for the Indiana Fever, already has 2.2million followers on Instagram and Whitlock, speaking on the latest episode of his show 'Fearless', predicts it won't be long before NBA players queue up to partner with Clark to get sponsors.\n\n\"The other thing that I think will be different about this next generation of NBA stars, at least this year, in the next year, for the next two years, at least if not longer, I think they're going to be competing with Caitlin Clark in terms of like what brands are using in commercials, and just pushing who is the face of basketball, more so than the face of the NBA,\" Whitlock said.\n\n\"If I'm Ant-Man [Anthony Edwards] and I really want to be the face of the league, I pretend like I'm the biggest Caitin Clark fan on the planet and try to bait marketers and brands [by saying], 'Hey, put me and Caitlin Clark in a commercial'.\"\n\nClark recently signed a long-term shoe sponsorship deal with Nike, joining a long line of NBA and WNBA stars such as Michael Jordan in doing so. The figures on the deal have not been disclosed, but it is believed she will earn an eight-figure fee from the sportswear giant.\n\nThe impact of Clark cannot be denied, with the WNBA Draft attracting 2.4 million viewers - four times the number of viewers that tuned in for the 2023 Draft.\n\nLikewise, fans followed the Iowa Hawkeyes just to catch a glimpse of her in action after she broke the all-time points scorer record with 3,951 points, surpassing the total previously set by Kelsey Plum.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Swoopes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheryl Swoopes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Plum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/2c2c6dfe28816af2dd882633b4146f8f/crop/0x0/2044x1363/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/04/17148228068775.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Our WNBA expert Jason Logan has combed through the markets and has found three great player props that will keep your eyes glued to Clark's rookie season. Find out more below!\n\nThe WNBA got its first look at No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark last Friday when the Indiana Fever opened exhibition play against the Dallas Wings.\n\nClark didn't disappoint, making her first two shots of the game - both 3-pointers - and scoring 16 points in the first half, before finishing with 21 points on 6-of-15 shooting (5 of 13 from 3-point range). She also added three rebounds, two assists, and two steals (along with five turnovers) in her 28 minutes of action.\n\nWhile it's tough to put stock in preseason results, Clark's pro debut was impressive. Indiana has one more exhibition game, versus the Atlanta Dream on Thursday, before its much-anticipated season opener against the Connecticut Sun on May 14.\n\nAhead of that contest, sportsbooks are offering WNBA odds on Caitlin Clark's rookie season (in which she's -700 to win Rookie of the Year), setting markets on everything from her statistical output to her chances of shattering league records in points and 3-pointers made.\n\nTwenty-two points per game doesn't sound like much when measured against Caitlin Clark's output at Iowa. Hell, she'd hang that in a half some nights. When it comes to the WNBA, however, 22-point seasons are rare air.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2022, only six players averaged 22-plus points per game. Last year marked a significant swing in scoring, featuring three stars posting an average of 22 or more: Jewel Loyd (24.7), Breanna Stewart (23.0), and A'Ja Wilson (22.8).\n\nThe opportunity is there for Clark to threaten this Over/Under, given her 3-point prowess and role in Indiana's offense. She'll get plenty of touches as there's not much firepower beyond Clark and second-year center Aliyah Boston. But asking for 22-plus is still a stretch.\n\nLooking at 2023's top scorers, all three came from offenses ranked Top 5 in pace per 40 minutes. Loyd was the lone gun on a shallow Seattle team, averaging more than 20 shots, while Stewart and Wilson played on stacked lineups that kept defenses honest in terms of double teams and attention.\n\nIn Year 1 under head coach Christie Sides, the Fever ran the second-slowest offensive tempo in the WNBA. That's expected to tick up in 2024, but as Sides alluded to after Friday's preseason debut, opponents will sell out on stopping Clark with aggressive defense and double teams.\n\nThis prop is available across different sportsbooks, with some operators offering two-way Yes/No action and others selling a solo prop on the Over 22+ as high as -160. Twenty-two points is a big ask for a rookie who will draw the ire of the defense each and every night.\n\nClark brings more than deadeye shooting to Indiana, including her playmaking and court vision. She averaged more than eight assists during her tenure in Iowa and sportsbooks have her assist prop sitting at 6.3 O/U for her WNBA rookie campaign.\n\nClark will log the minutes and handle the ball enough to display her passing prowess, but this assist prop is a tall order - even more than topping 22 points per game.\n\nThere were six players that averaged six or more assists in 2023 and only four of those tallied 6.3 dimes per contest: Courtney Vandersloot (8.1), Alyssa Thomas (7.9), Chelsea Gray (7.3), and Courtney Williams (6.3).\n\nNot only does Indiana run a much slower tempo than Clark is used to, but Christie Side's offense finished dead last in assist-to-FG ratio in 2023. That will undoubtedly go up in 2024, but it will be the likes of Erica Wheeler and Kelsey Mitchell seeing their assists spike thanks to Clark's shooting.\n\nWith defenses collapsing on Clark and making her put the ball on the ground, she will have windows to make plays with her passes. But Indiana didn't draft her to be a traditional point guard and it's unreasonable to think she'll average more than 6.3 assists when she's attempting close to 20 shots per game.\n\nThe math says Clark has to hit at least 3.25 triples per outing over 40 games to make 130 total 3-pointers on the season. Given the trajectory of the 3-ball in the WNBA landscape and the Fever's likely game scripts in 2024, Clark will absolutely get her chances to top this prop.\n\nThe 3-pointer has been on the rise in the WNBA since 2018 and the 2023 campaign tied 2022 for a high of 7.7 average made triples from teams per game. This aligns with what we've seen in the NBA, with analytics prioritizing the 3-point shot above everything but a layup.\n\nLast year, New York Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu finished with a record 128 3-pointers in 36 regular season games (3.55 per contest). That broke Diana Taurasi's 2006 mark of 121 3-pointers, which came under Paul Westhead's infamous up-tempo system.\n\nIonescu, who shot 44.5% from beyond the arc, posted those record numbers on a Liberty roster loaded with stars, who demanded touches but also played with the lead most nights. There was far less urgency for Ionescu to take and make 3-pointers.\n\nIf we look at Dallas' Arike Ogunbowale and Seattle's Jewel Loyd, they led the league in 3-point attempts in 2023 (341 and 323 respectively) as the top offensive option for their teams - not sharing the ball like Sabrina. Ogunbowale and Loyd finished with 117 and 115 made triples on 39.8 and 37% shooting.\n\nGiven that Clark will play a similar starring role for an Indiana team projected to sit around .500 and knowing her volume from downtown (she shot 13 in the preseason opener), it's no stretch to see her launch close to 400 attempts from 3-point land this season.\n\nBased on her outside shooting success at Iowa, Clark is expected to connect on 38% of those long-range looks. That trickles down to 152 made 3-pointers on the high end (should she play all 40 games) and 137 makes from distance if she plays 36 games like Ionescu last season.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com",

Here are thoughts from Cat Ariail, Noa Dalzell, \u0141ukasz Muniowski, Eric Nemchock and Edwin Garcia:\n\nLast season, only four WNBA teams won more than half of their games: the Las Vegas Aces, New York Liberty, Connecticut Sun and Dallas Wings. That means that eight of the league's 12 teams were below .500 teams. It'd be great to see more parity at the top. Teams like the Seattle Storm and Indiana Fever, both of which were toward the bottom of league standings last year, could be due for significant improvements. The Storm, in particular, made a splash in free agency, signing both Skylar Diggins-Smith and Nneka Ogwumike. The duo should help push another team into championship contention. -- Noa Dalzell\n\nIt seems like we're destined for another A'ja-Stewie-AT MVP showdown. Can another player disrupt that expected hegemony and become a genuine candidate? Napheesa Collier seems like the strongest contender, especially if the Minnesota Lynx exceed expectations. More interestingly, could a guard breakthrough? Not since Diana Taurasi in 2009 has a guard won the award. -- Cat Ariail\n\nI want to see history! Most 3-pointers in a game, biggest blowout, most comeback wins, largest crowd ever -- let's break some records! The game is all about pushing things forward, and if we have some iconic moments during the regular season, I'm all for that. -- Edwin Garcia\n\nThe WNBA will finally be using Second Spectrum 3D tracking data starting this season, which is something writers and analysts have been pining for. Right now, it seems like the league will be focusing on using Second Spectrum to enhance its own insights into player performance and develop a wider range of data for its teams. Hopefully, that data will soon become available publicly; it would open up plenty of roads of analysis for those writing about the WNBA, and that's good for the game. -- Eric Nemchock\n\nAsked about flying commercial to regular season away games after flying private with Iowa, Caitlin Clark said on Wednesday:\n\nIt will definitely be an adjustment, but, you know, it is what it is. I think the CBA is up for renegotiation after the season, we can opt out of it, and certainly the new media rights deal will have a big impact on that too. So, at this point of my career, and across the WNBA, it is what it is.\n\nThe WNBPA has the option to opt out of the CBA in 2025, and that decision will partially be dependent on this season's numbers -- the more money the league brings in, the bigger the WNBPA's leverage in the negotiations will be. If the league wishes to continue to grow, the athletes need to have the comfort to focus on basketball. And making travel easier would definitely boost their performance. -- \u0141ukasz Muniowski\n\nWith more attention on the league, new casual fans are realizing just how ridiculous things are in the WNBA. The fact that WNBA preseason games are hard to watch, practice facilities are poor, flights are commercial and wages are not acceptable for professional athletes in America in the league's 28th season is unacceptable. With new voices at larger quantities, maybe we can make some of the progress us long-time viewers have been begging for throughout the years. It won't all happen this season, but I'm optimistic that this is the beginning of the end of poor working conditions for WNBA players. -- EG\n\nThe Sky have been lagging behind the rest of the WNBA for years when it comes to off-court accommodations, and with teams like the Las Vegas Aces, Seattle Storm and Phoenix Mercury recently opening state-of-the-art facilities for their players, that discrepancy has become even more obvious. There have been more than a few whispers about how this affects the Sky when recruiting players in free agency -- several players who either recently left Chicago or were reported to be considering the Sky before choosing to sign with a different team have pointed out how valued they feel in their new homes -- and those who do play in Chicago, plainly put, deserve better than what they've been getting. It would be disappointing if the Sky do not, at the very least, announce plans for developing a more modern and convenient facility this year. -- EN\n\nThere will undoubtedly be more eyes on the WNBA this season after so much hype and attention surrounding the most recent draft class, headlined by Caitlin Clark. But it's important that new viewers embrace the veteran stars that have been playing at elite levels for years now. Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray aren't household names, but they're two of the most critical players on the back-to-back championship Aces. Other elite players like Napheesa Collier and Kahleah Copper don't have widespread name recognition despite both being some of the best players in the league. Some of the responsibility to draw in viewers to care about these players will fall on the media, and some will fall on teams themselves. The Indiana Fever, for example, have an imperative to get people to care not just about Caitlin Clark, but about the rest of the roster as well. -- ND\n\nThere's more buzz than ever around women's basketball, with growing appreciation for the skills, smarts and achievements of women hoopers. As such, the league no longer needs to seek the validation of male figures. Excessively promoting prominent men, particularly NBA players, who attend WNBA games on broadcasts or social media platforms not only is unnecessary, but it also reinforces the idea the men's basketball is superior. The implicit message is that women's basketball is relevant because men's basketball players provide their stamp of approval. Stop! We don't need to see clout-chasing NBA players sitting courtside! Keep the focus on the women on the court! -- CA\n\nThe WNBA started the in-season tournament and the NBA copied it...and made it better? They had different jerseys, new courts and teams playing with purpose. I want more if that energy in the W. Let's have these games mean more. We're off to a good start with a new format showcasing the games the first week in June and the championship game on June 25. The title games have been electric, but I want energy closer to that during the first couple of weeks of action. Hopefully, we get that. -- EG\n\nIn recent seasons, the WNBA All-Star Game has begun to look more like it's NBA counterpart -- lots of 3s, not a lot of defense. This year's format, where members of Team USA who are voted or selected as All-Stars will play against other All-Stars, presents the conditions for a more competitive game. In 2021, the first time the league featured the Team USA vs. WNBA All-Stars format, the W All-Star team, which featured several Team USA snubs, prevailed over the ostensibly superior Olympic team. This year, it's likely the All-Stars again will be seen as the underdogs and motivated to upset the Olympians; let's hope the members of Team USA likewise are determined to prove they are most deserving of wearing the red, white and blue. -- CA\n\nThis NCAA tournament enjoyed record-breaking numbers, and the more players from this recent class make the WNBA, the better. That particularly applies for players like Iowa's Kate Martin, who was drafted by the Aces with the No. 18 pick, but may or may not make the final roster. There aren't enough spots in the WNBA, but some particular fan favorites getting cut after training camp could take some of the energy out of the upcoming season. That was the case last year, when well-known players like Monika Czinano, Brea Beal and Alexis Morris were all waived. -- ND\n\nThere's going to be an adjustment period for Caitlin Clark, especially defensively. Players like Kelsey Plum were unstoppable in college, but took a few years to acclimate to the WNBA. Clark's acclimation should be viewed with grace; most No. 1 picks have needed time to adjust to the big league. My hope is that she's able to contribute at a high-level for the Fever, and that viewers tuning into the W for the first time to watch her are able to see her thrive. -- ND\n\nThis is where things get personal. Four years ago, I started writing a book about the 2020-21 season in the second tier of the Polish women's basketball league, with special focus on Polonia Warsaw. The team was in rebuild mode, with a new coach and exactly half the roster being new arrivals. Their goal wasn't to win promotion to the highest league in the country, just make the playoffs. Polonia ended up obliterating the competition and winning the league. This season I'm not only covering the Fever for Swish Appeal, but I also have a book deal with the University of Iowa Press for a project centered on Caitlin Clark and the Fever, and the team is talking about making the playoffs. You probably know where I'm going with this, so I'll stop right there, not to jinx anything. -- \u0141M\n\nIn my opinion, you are not a dynasty until you win three in a row. The Las Vegas Aces are on the cusp of that. Whether they get it or not, it will be entertaining either way. I think they are the greatest WNBA team ever assembled, and watching them secure that claim will be the biggest story this season. Caitlin Clark and a new class of rookies is all fun, but it's about winning it all -- and the Aces are still the Queens of the league. Will someone best them? -- EG\n\nBuilding off Edwin's desire to see the Aces' confirm their dynasty, I'm curious as to how Vegas will approach their three-peat quest. Last season, the Aces defended their title by winning games at a historic rate. This season, will they attack the regular season with a similar disposition to dominate? Or, will going for a third-straight title during an Olympic year result in a more measured, managed approach to the regular season, knowing that, when the postseason arrives, they'll be able to flip the switch and join the Houston Comets as the league's only back-to-back-to-back champs? -- CA\n\nIf you're a fan of the best basketball competition in Europe, the Lynx should be your favorite WNBA team. Kayla McBride was phenomenal this season playing for Fenerbah\u00e7e, and the Final Four MVP trophy is a testament to her basketball abilities. Along with Napheesa Collier, McBride led Fenerbah\u00e7e to triumph in EuroLeague Women, with both playing vital roles for the reigning champs. McBride and Collier are household names in the WNBA too, but with Dorka Juh\u00e1sz, Bridget Carleton, Cecilia Zandalasini and Olivia \u00c9poupa on the training camp roster, more EuroLeague Women standouts are looking to prove that they belong in the best league in the world. And they should feel right at home in the Lynx's truly diverse environment. I'm especially rooting for Carleton, who's just an awesome person. -- \u0141M\n\nCovering the Sparks has been an honor and a privilege I take seriously. However, I have yet to see one postseason game during my time doing so. That's unacceptable for a team with its history. Can this be the year? It's more of a rebuilding situation in Southern California, but you just need to sneak into the top eight in a league with only 12 teams. It should be feasible if everyone stays healthy, or so I tell myself. -- EG\n\nI'll admit it, I'm a bit biased because I'm on the Connecticut Sun beat. But, what Thomas and Bonner were able to do last year was pretty remarkable. Thomas set the regular-season record for most double-doubles and triple-doubles. Meanwhile, at age 36, Bonner averaged 17.4 points per game, the third-highest scoring season of her career. If the duo is able to maintain that level of play, the Sun should once again be championship contenders after finishing with the league's third-best record last year. -- ND\n\nDiana Taurasi expertly filled her role as the cranky, crusty vet during \"The Bird & Taurasi Show\" broadcast of NCAA Tournament games, resisting showering the coming generation with praise and plaudits. That's her right. And it's also the right of the young guns to refuse to bow down to the player some consider women's basketball's GOAT. Luckily for Taurasi, any rooks looking to knock off her crown will have the go through Phoenix Mercury newcomers Kahleah Copper and Natasha Cloud. While DT's soon-to-be 42-year-old legs might not be able to slow sprightly youngsters, the Philly-born duo of Kah and Tash should relish the opportunity to lock up any overly ambitious attempts to take it to Taurasi. In general, seeing Copper and Cloud unleash aggressive perimeter defense, knowing Brittney Griner is back there protecting the rim, will be a fun sight after Phoenix's struggles in that department last season. -- CA\n\nIn the 2024 WNBA Draft, the Sky were able to land the best players on the previous two NCAA championship teams in Kamilla Cardoso (No. 3) and Angel Reese (No. 7). Both know what it takes to win and both aren't afraid of the spotlight, which will shine a bit brighter in the third-biggest media market in the country. Cardoso is naturally shy, but she overcame that once she became comfortable on the court. Prior to the draft, she was praised for her spontaneity and easy-going approach. Angel Reese is just a vibe, a unique personality who makes games entertaining. I smell a sitcom, or at least a buddy movie, punctuated by some great basketball. -- \u0141M\n\nNot much has gone right for the Mystics since the beginning of last season, and that includes an injury-plagued sophomore campaign for Austin. Washington's young center has Defensive Player of the Year potential, and she'll now get more reps on offense, too, if she's fully recovered from the hip surgery she underwent last year. Given good health, Austin could be a contender for the WNBA's Most Improved Player award, and she'll form a fierce defensive duo with rookie forward Aaliyah Edwards. -- EN\n\nAbove, \u0141ukasz mentioned the upcoming CBA negotiations as an opportunity for WNBPA to push for private travel. That's an obvious priority. A soft cap should be as well. Financial fairness among ownership groups has carried the day during the WNBA's 28-year history. The growth of the league, rather than of individual teams, has been the goal, one that was enforced by a strict hard cap. However, preventing owners who are willing to spend more from doing so has contributed to the deflation of player salaries. Right now, the likes of A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Brittney Griner all are on sub-max salaries, choosing to sacrifice their earnings so that they their teams can have a stronger supporting casts. A soft cap would allow those players to receive maximum salaries, as their team could go over the cap to sign them and still fairly compensate their teammates. While this system would appear to advantage teams with richer owners, there's no guarantee that the priciest teams will be the best teams. (Take a look at the state of the men's professional sports teams controlled by Aces owner Mark Davis, Liberty owner Joe Tsai and Mercury owner Mat Ishbia.) A financial arms race also would demand that owning a WNBA team no longer be treated as some sort of feel-good, pro-women charity investment, but, instead, be taken as a serious investment into a competitive, growing entertainment industry. -- CA\n\nIs it truly a WNBA season if there isn't talk of expansion? We know that the league will be adding a new team in Golden State next year (and that there's already been over 7,000 deposits made for season tickets), but further details are still scarce. What will the new team name be? What will their color scheme look like? And is the addition of a 14th team also on the horizon? WNBA fans anxiously await more information on the future landscape of the league. -- EN", "source": {"uri": "swishappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swish Appeal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Disregard the age of the opponent, she's the best player on the floor, in a packed arena.\n\nOn Friday night at the College Park Center in Arlington on the campus of UTA, the Dallas Wings' WNBA team, thanks to some shrewd foresight, were the first team to host the Indiana Fever and the biggest thing to hit women's sports in this country ever.\n\nThis was not your standard preseason game. This felt like the playoffs, even if the players dismissed it as a scrimmage.\n\nClark's arrival to Arlington sold all 6,251 tickets for a game that normally is free. This was one of the Wings' two preseason games, and tickets for these exhibitions are typically giveaways.\n\nEven if it's a warmup, you don't give away tickets to watch Elvis in a recording session. On the secondary market, one ticket was going for $666 on the floor. The bad seats, which there are not many in this quaint arena, were going for about $75.\n\nPeople are also reading...

PATH to lay off dozens in Bloomington after losing state 988 grant Man waiting murder trial accused of contacting witness from McLean County Jail\n\nIn her first game as a pro, Caitlin did for the Indiana Fever what she did for the Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nClark led the Fever with 21 points, including those deep 3-pointers that made her a national name. The only hitch to this script was she missed a short bunny in the final minute, and after the Wings took the lead in the waning seconds, Clark's difficult game-tying 3-point shot from the deep corner was off.\n\nThe Wings won the game, 79-76, but this was a win for everyone.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better first game, really, for women's basketball,\" Clark said after the game. \"Tremendous game, down to the wire, both teams competing; that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIdeally.\n\nThere was not a single negative to be found here on Friday night, with one glaring exception. The WNBA needs more, real players. And until not only that happens, we have to get over all of this \"explosion\" talk surrounding this league, and women's sports.\n\nUntil we as a sports consuming culture focus on the performance rather than the \"movement\" of girls and women playing basketball, volleyball, softball, and anything else, we ain't there. Until the focus is primarily on the production of the player and coach and GM, rather than equality and Title IX, this is all in the development stages.\n\nThat's not an indictment on any woman playing these games but where America is in its evolution buying women's sports.\n\nBecause the concept of buying women's sports is still relatively new. Think 1990-ish as a launch date. The concept of a Caitlin Clark in 1985 was a fantasy.\n\nBe patient, people.\n\nThe first year of the NBA was in 1946-'47, but the league didn't find stability, and popularity, until the '80s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along. Before Magic and Bird, pro basketball was 30 years of small crowds, folding teams, and a product that was second tier behind baseball and football.\n\nThe WNBA's first season was in 1997, so you do the math.\n\nWe have a ways to go, but it's better than it's ever been, and Clark's arrival will eventually be viewed as a marker. Because she's a prodigy.\n\nShe's not Bird. She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA, and women's sports to \"make it,\" but Caitlin Clark is not marketing gimmick.\n\nIt's an organic creation that Americans want to buy, and she's worth the price.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry

Her outstanding contribution to basketball made people go gaga over her, and she became an inspiration for the younger generation.\n\nAs she entered the bigger pond, the WNBA with the Indiana Fever, her craze grew even further. In her preseason debut game against Dallas, a young girl holding a placard was seen delivering the message \"When I grow up I wanna be like her\", Caitlin Clark was written at the bottom along with a heart. The picture soon surfaced on the internet, and it was a moment of pride for the budding star.\n\nAfter winning the AAU Sullivan Award a couple of days ago, Clark said, \"I have been inspired by so many athletes that came before me and I hope I can be that same inspiration for the next generation to follow their dreams.\"\n\nOn Friday night's game, all eyes were on Clark who scored 21 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals for the Fever, but that wasn't enough to save the franchise from losing 79-76, to which the 6-footer had an unexpected reaction.\n\nThe result might not have been as competitive as Clark's expectations, but her debut was. In a post-game interview, Clark told ESPN, \"I thought we played really hard. Just a great atmosphere for women's basketball.\" She further added, \"I think it's a good kickoff to the WNBA season.\"\n\nWhile expressing satisfaction with certain aspects of Friday's game, the 22-year-old mentioned that they could have executed their offensive side in a better way but the night overall went as she had anticipated.\n\nDespite the preseason loss, the guard showcased an outstanding debut. The Fever will face the Connecticut Sun as their regular season kicks off on May 14, which will test Caitlin Clark's abilities to smash records and climb the staircase of excellence in the pro league.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Sullivan_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James E.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe debate surrounding the WNBA's use of commercial flights has come back into the spotlight after former women's college basketball star Caitlin Clark made her first trip with the Indiana Fever to Texas this week ahead of their preseason game against the Dallas Wings.\n\nVideo shared on social media Thursday showed the WNBA No. 1 overall pick and her teammates arriving at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nThe immediate response from social media users was why the league wasn't flying the team on a charter flight - something the Iowa program utilized during Clark's time as a Hawkeye.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"It'll definitely be an adjustment, but it is what it is,\" Clark said of the issue while speaking to the media on Thursday.\n\n\"At this point of my career and across the WNBA, it is what it is. I'm sure, certainly, everybody would say that they would love to be flying charter all the time - that definitely would help a lot of problems. But I think the fever organization has done a really good job of getting out ahead of things. There's going to be a lot of security traveling with us, there will be certain plans of how we're going to navigate going throughout airports and things like that.\"\n\nBecoming the NCAA Division 1 all-time leading scorer, Clark helped the NCAA reach its best viewership in history for women's basketball, with nearly 19 million fans watching the title game.\n\nCAITLIN CLARK KNOWS WNBA TITLE IS ULTIMATE GOAL, BUT HOPES 'TO GET BACK TO THE PLAYOFFS' IN ROOKIE YEAR\n\nThe hope is that it will translate to the WNBA, and if it does, it could present a safety issue at airports.\n\n\"It's not like we're the odd man out here. Everybody has to navigate, it and I think it's going to cause some problems, maybe, because the popularity of our league is continuing to grow and having to navigate travel with that,\" Clark continued Thursday.\n\n\"But at the same time, that's a positive thing, too. You want people to be excited about our game. Hopefully, it changes in the near future, but for now that's just what it is, and everybody's dealing with the same thing. You can't use it as an excuse.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFever general manager Lin Dunn told reporters Thursday that the team has security measures in place, but declined to disclose the details.\n\n\"We're certainly aware of what took place at Iowa when she traveled to away arenas, and certainly we're aware of what happened at Ohio State, and we're going to take all the precautions we can to make sure that not only is she safe, but that I'm safe - that we're all safe, that all the players are prepared to be safe and secure.\"\n\nLast year, the WNBA spent $4 million on charter flights for the entire playoffs as well as for any back-to-back games during the regular season. Ahead of the draft last month, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert confirmed that the league would do the same this season.\n\n\"No one wants (charters) more than I do for these players. We need to be in the right financial position,\" Engelbert said. \"Just a few years ago, we were surviving. Now we're going from survive to thrive. We want to do it at the appropriate time.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paulina_dedaj@foxnews.com", "name": "Paulina Dedaj", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Fort_Worth_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Fort Worth International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Dunn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lin Dunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/caitlin_clark.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Disregard the age of the opponent, she's the best player on the floor, in a packed arena.\n\nOn Friday night at the College Park Center in Arlington on the campus of UTA, the Dallas Wings' WNBA team, thanks to some shrewd foresight, were the first team to host the Indiana Fever and the biggest thing to hit women's sports in this country ever.\n\nThis was not your standard preseason game. This felt like the playoffs, even if the players dismissed it as a scrimmage.\n\nClark's arrival to Arlington sold all 6,251 tickets for a game that normally is free. This was one of the Wings' two preseason games, and tickets for these exhibitions are typically giveaways.\n\nEven if it's a warmup, you don't give away tickets to watch Elvis in a recording session. On the secondary market, one ticket was going for $666 on the floor. The bad seats, which there are not many in this quaint arena, were going for about $75.\n\nPeople are also reading... 7 arrested in 2-day prostitution operation in Sioux City Tacos La Juanita plans second Sioux City location; fifth overall Spokesman says second David Schultz autopsy to proceed without body, calls out Facebook group Five Questions with ...

The only hitch to this script was she missed a short bunny in the final minute, and after the Wings took the lead in the waning seconds, Clark's difficult game-tying 3-point shot from the deep corner was off.\n\nThe Wings won the game, 79-76, but this was a win for everyone.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better first game, really, for women's basketball,\" Clark said after the game. \"Tremendous game, down to the wire, both teams competing; that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIdeally.\n\nThere was not a single negative to be found here on Friday night, with one glaring exception. The WNBA needs more, real players. And until not only that happens, we have to get over all of this \"explosion\" talk surrounding this league, and women's sports.\n\nUntil we as a sports consuming culture focus on the performance rather than the \"movement\" of girls and women playing basketball, volleyball, softball, and anything else, we ain't there. Until the focus is primarily on the production of the player and coach and GM, rather than equality and Title IX, this is all in the development stages.\n\nThat's not an indictment on any woman playing these games but where America is in its evolution buying women's sports.\n\nBecause the concept of buying women's sports is still relatively new. Think 1990-ish as a launch date. The concept of a Caitlin Clark in 1985 was a fantasy.\n\nBe patient, people.\n\nThe first year of the NBA was in 1946-'47, but the league didn't find stability, and popularity, until the '80s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along. Before Magic and Bird, pro basketball was 30 years of small crowds, folding teams, and a product that was second tier behind baseball and football.\n\nThe WNBA's first season was in 1997, so you do the math.\n\nWe have a ways to go, but it's better than it's ever been, and Clark's arrival will eventually be viewed as a marker. Because she's a prodigy.\n\nShe's not Bird. She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA, and women's sports to \"make it,\" but Caitlin Clark is not marketing gimmick.\n\nIt's an organic creation that Americans want to buy, and she's worth the price.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad

Fanatics even said her jersey broke the one-night sales record for the company after she was drafted by the Indiana Fever on April 15. (Though that record's since been broken by NFL No. 1 pick Caleb Williams.)\n\nWith that popularity comes a ton of security risks -- Clark, like any major celebrity, is a household name that could be recognized wherever she goes. Security is one of the major reasons why sports leagues like the NBA and NFL allow their teams to travel via charter flights -- on top of the benefits for rest and convenience that these provide.\n\nRelated: The harsh reality behind the shockingly low WNBA contracts\n\nThe WNBA does not allow its teams to fly private. Before you question whether this is because the league lacks revenue, you should know that this is actually a rule that was included in its Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2020.\n\nClark's popularity is unlike anything the WNBA has ever seen, but she is not above the rules of the league's CBA. So on Thursday, May 2, Clark was spotted with her team arriving at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in time for their scheduled preseason game with the Dallas Wings on Friday, May 3.\n\nA video surfaced of her arrival, and as WNBA reporter Khristina Williams pointed out, it seems as though she had some added security alongside her compared to most WNBA players.\n\nBased on the video, there was no ruckus surrounding Clark's arrival in Dallas -- which could be partly because her team's playing an exhibition game.\n\nBut this could eventually present a problem especially as the season starts and if the league continues to grow.\n\nRelated: Brittney Griner takes the blame for Russia detainment in tearful interview\n\nLast year, Brittney Griner actually faced harassment in the same airport. Griner returned to action in 2023 after being detained in Russia for 10 months -- a story that was national news -- and she was verbally provoked by a YouTube personality.\n\nInstances like this have triggered WNBA players to clamor for chartered flights. The pockets of some owners are deep enough to provide private flights to their teams, like when the New York Liberty were caught flying charter in 2021 and were eventually penalized for it.\n\nMore Women's Basketball:\n\nThe league has allowed for some special instances, including allowing Griner to fly charter after last season's airport incident, and allowing for teams to fly private during the 2023 WNBA Playoffs.\n\nBut the rule remains the same outside of these cases and will likely last until the first chance the WNBA players can opt out of the current deal which would be on Oct. 31, 2025.\n\nIn the meantime, it will be interesting to follow if the current policy creates any more of a ruckus when big name rookies like Clark and Angel Reese are seen in different airports around the country over the next four months.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nThe Arena Media Brands, LLC THESTREET is a registered trademark of TheStreet, Inc.", "source":

Disregard the age of the opponent, she's the best player on the floor, in a packed arena.\n\nOn Friday night at the College Park Center in Arlington on the campus of UTA, the Dallas Wings' WNBA team, thanks to some shrewd foresight, were the first team to host the Indiana Fever and the biggest thing to hit women's sports in this country ever.\n\nThis was not your standard preseason game. This felt like the playoffs, even if the players dismissed it as a scrimmage.\n\nClark's arrival to Arlington sold all 6,251 tickets for a game that normally is free. This was one of the Wings' two preseason games, and tickets for these exhibitions are typically giveaways.\n\nEven if it's a warmup, you don't give away tickets to watch Elvis in a recording session. On the secondary market, one ticket was going for $666 on the floor. The bad seats, which there are not many in this quaint arena, were going for about $75.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nPicasso Taqueria opens at Merino Mill in Mooresville Mooresville U.S. Marshal killed, Statesville officer injured in Charlotte shootout (copy) Appalachian State football player Jack Murphy dies 4 officers serving warrant are killed, 4 wounded in shootout at North Carolina home, police say A heckler tried to derail Trevor Noah's speech at Wake Forest University.

The only hitch to this script was she missed a short bunny in the final minute, and after the Wings took the lead in the waning seconds, Clark's difficult game-tying 3-point shot from the deep corner was off.\n\nThe Wings won the game, 79-76, but this was a win for everyone.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better first game, really, for women's basketball,\" Clark said after the game. \"Tremendous game, down to the wire, both teams competing; that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIdeally.\n\nThere was not a single negative to be found here on Friday night, with one glaring exception. The WNBA needs more, real players. And until not only that happens, we have to get over all of this \"explosion\" talk surrounding this league, and women's sports.\n\nUntil we as a sports consuming culture focus on the performance rather than the \"movement\" of girls and women playing basketball, volleyball, softball, and anything else, we ain't there. Until the focus is primarily on the production of the player and coach and GM, rather than equality and Title IX, this is all in the development stages.\n\nThat's not an indictment on any woman playing these games but where America is in its evolution buying women's sports.\n\nBecause the concept of buying women's sports is still relatively new. Think 1990-ish as a launch date. The concept of a Caitlin Clark in 1985 was a fantasy.\n\nBe patient, people.\n\nThe first year of the NBA was in 1946-'47, but the league didn't find stability, and popularity, until the '80s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along. Before Magic and Bird, pro basketball was 30 years of small crowds, folding teams, and a product that was second tier behind baseball and football.\n\nThe WNBA's first season was in 1997, so you do the math.\n\nWe have a ways to go, but it's better than it's ever been, and Clark's arrival will eventually be viewed as a marker. Because she's a prodigy.\n\nShe's not Bird. She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA,

Brown New Iowa law regulates traffic cameras, which generated $1.16 million for Waterloo in 2023\n\nIn her first game as a pro, Caitlin did for the Indiana Fever what she did for the Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nClark led the Fever with 21 points, including those deep 3-pointers that made her a national name. The only hitch to this script was she missed a short bunny in the final minute, and after the Wings took the lead in the waning seconds, Clark's difficult game-tying 3-point shot from the deep corner was off.\n\nThe Wings won the game, 79-76, but this was a win for everyone.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better first game, really, for women's basketball,\" Clark said after the game. \"Tremendous game, down to the wire, both teams competing; that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIdeally.\n\nThere was not a single negative to be found here on Friday night, with one glaring exception. The WNBA needs more, real players. And until not only that happens, we have to get over all of this \"explosion\" talk surrounding this league, and women's sports.\n\nUntil we as a sports consuming culture focus on the performance rather than the \"movement\" of girls and women playing basketball, volleyball, softball, and anything else, we ain't there. Until the focus is primarily on the production of the player and coach and GM, rather than equality and Title IX, this is all in the development stages.\n\nThat's not an indictment on any woman playing these games but where America is in its evolution buying women's sports.\n\nBecause the concept of buying women's sports is still relatively new. Think 1990-ish as a launch date. The concept of a Caitlin Clark in 1985 was a fantasy.\n\nBe patient, people.\n\nThe first year of the NBA was in 1946-'47, but the league didn't find stability, and popularity, until the '80s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along. Before Magic and Bird, pro basketball was 30 years of small crowds, folding teams, and a product that was second tier behind baseball and football.\n\nThe WNBA's first season was in 1997, so you do the math.\n\nWe have a ways to go, but it's better than it's ever been, and Clark's arrival will eventually be viewed as a marker. Because she's a prodigy.\n\nShe's not Bird. She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA, and women's sports to \"make it,\" but Caitlin Clark is not marketing gimmick.\n\nIt's an organic creation that Americans want to buy, and she's worth the price.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad

She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA, and women's sports to \"make it,\" but Caitlin Clark is not marketing gimmick.\n\nIt's an organic creation that Americans want to buy, and she's worth the price.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Tns Nfl Pro Football

The viral clip has reignited a simmering debate about the league's treatment of its athletes, sparking widespread discussion and concern among fans.\n\nThis recent incident occurs at a crucial juncture for the WNBA. With viewership numbers reaching record highs and the league experiencing a surge in popularity, incidents like this have the potential to overshadow the positive strides the WNBA is making.\n\nClark, the No.1 overall pick in this year's draft, was filmed boarding a commercial flight alongside other Indiana Fever players for tonight's preseason game against the Dallas Wings. Swift and unforgiving reactions flooded Twitter, with many fans expressing their frustration and disappointment.\n\n\"The league should be ashamed of themselves for not having charter flights,\" one fan said.\n\nAdditionally, some fans expressed concerns about the safety of the players in these scenarios.\n\n\"WNBA need to fly their play private plane this crazy safe of these ladies should be #1 goal,\" wrote one fan.\n\n\"I know they don't make money but she is the most known player in WNBA, they should be flying private plane for her safety...\" said another fan.\n\nSome fans also appear to respect the team's decision to fly commercials, noting that it has been a longstanding practice for years and is not a new occurrence.\n\n\"The W has flown like this for years. This ain't nothing new. Welcome to the W,\" a fan said.\n\n\"What's wrong with this again??\" said another fan.\n\nHowever, criticism also extended to the team owners, with some pointing out their inability to provide private flights for the team.\n\n\"How are they not flying private owners gotta do better,\" a fan wrote.\n\nWhy WNBA's travel limitations remain a challenge\n\nThe straightforward explanation? Money. Despite its promising growth, the WNBA is financially younger compared to the NBA. Operating expenses, including travel costs, remain notably lower. The NBA generates billions in revenue annually, dwarfing the WNBA's figures, allowing the NBA to invest heavily in travel for player comfort and recovery.\n\nThe WNBA's current TV media rights deal generates approximately $60 million annually. In contrast, the NBA's current TV deal brings in roughly $2.1 billion for the league. This stark contrast highlights the significant disparity in financial resources between the WNBA and its male counterpart in professional basketball.\n\nThe WNBA Players Association has long advocated for better travel accommodations, citing fatigue and a compressed schedule as hurdles to peak performance. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has previously acknowledged the issue, but improvements have been slow.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "satyajeet_chall@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Satyajeet Chall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/eaa1a-17147514295804-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Today I was part of the problem,\" he wrote in a post with the column's link. \"What I've learned is that I need to be more aware about how I talk to people -- not just athletes,\" Doyel wrote in his column. \"You can say that's absurd, that I should've known better, and I do. But here we are. I was just doing what I do, talking to another athlete, another person, and didn't see the line -- didn't even know there was a line in the vicinity -- until I crossed it.\"\n\nHe added, \"In my haste to be clever, to be familiar and welcoming (or so I thought), I offended Caitlin and her family.\"\n\nClark and the Fever fell short to the Dallas Wings in her preseason debut.

Disregard the age of the opponent, she's the best player on the floor, in a packed arena.\n\nOn Friday night at the College Park Center in Arlington on the campus of UTA, the Dallas Wings' WNBA team, thanks to some shrewd foresight, were the first team to host the Indiana Fever and the biggest thing to hit women's sports in this country ever.\n\nThis was not your standard preseason game. This felt like the playoffs, even if the players dismissed it as a scrimmage.\n\nClark's arrival to Arlington sold all 6,251 tickets for a game that normally is free. This was one of the Wings' two preseason games, and tickets for these exhibitions are typically giveaways.\n\nEven if it's a warmup, you don't give away tickets to watch Elvis in a recording session. On the secondary market, one ticket was going for $666 on the floor. The bad seats, which there are not many in this quaint arena, were going for about $75.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The only hitch to this script was she missed a short bunny in the final minute, and after the Wings took the lead in the waning seconds, Clark's difficult game-tying 3-point shot from the deep corner was off.\n\nThe Wings won the game, 79-76, but this was a win for everyone.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better first game, really, for women's basketball,\" Clark said after the game. \"Tremendous game, down to the wire, both teams competing; that's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIdeally.\n\nThere was not a single negative to be found here on Friday night, with one glaring exception. The WNBA needs more, real players. And until not only that happens, we have to get over all of this \"explosion\" talk surrounding this league, and women's sports.\n\nUntil we as a sports consuming culture focus on the performance rather than the \"movement\" of girls and women playing basketball, volleyball, softball, and anything else, we ain't there. Until the focus is primarily on the production of the player and coach and GM, rather than equality and Title IX, this is all in the development stages.\n\nThat's not an indictment on any woman playing these games but where America is in its evolution buying women's sports.\n\nBecause the concept of buying women's sports is still relatively new. Think 1990-ish as a launch date. The concept of a Caitlin Clark in 1985 was a fantasy.\n\nBe patient, people.\n\nThe first year of the NBA was in 1946-'47, but the league didn't find stability, and popularity, until the '80s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along. Before Magic and Bird, pro basketball was 30 years of small crowds, folding teams, and a product that was second tier behind baseball and football.\n\nThe WNBA's first season was in 1997, so you do the math.\n\nWe have a ways to go, but it's better than it's ever been, and Clark's arrival will eventually be viewed as a marker. Because she's a prodigy.\n\nShe's not Bird. She's Beethoven.\n\nAfter Bird's first few practices as a rookie with the Boston Celtics, he said he knew he could dominate the NBA.\n\nAfter watching Caitlin Clark cook and smoke defenders on Friday night, she might be the Rookie of the Year who wins the MVP award, too.\n\nShe is already its best shooter; the NBA should extend an invite to her to compete in what should now be a WNBA v. NBA 3-point shootout competition during the 2025 All-Star weekend.\n\nShe barely knows her new teammates and yet displayed the vision and passing skills that former Syracuse men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim compared to the late Pete Maravich. Her teammates blew at least three layups off her perfect passes.\n\nShe might be the best passer in the WNBA, NBA or NCAA right now. Her basketball IQ is as good as any player in the sport, men or women.\n\nAs evidenced by her second half on Friday night where she scored five points, this transition from college to the pros will have a bump or two, or three. She has been with this team for five days.\n\nWith 2:19 remaining in the game on Friday night, the Fever led the Wings by two and it felt like it all mattered. This was a good atmosphere, and a good product. And it was a preseason game.\n\nFor anyone over the age of 35, to see this for a women's game is not just progress but a real tearjerker.\n\n\"The excitement around women's basketball, honored. Grateful. Proud,\" said Wings coach Latricia Trammell, who has been in the sport for more than 30 years. \"I have to give credit to these players, they are putting a great product on the floor. When I drove up to the arena, to see the line waiting 2 1/2 hours early I knew it was going to be special.\"\n\nThey were in line for one reason.\n\nMuch more has to be done, and will, for the WNBA, and women's sports to \"make it,\" but Caitlin Clark is not marketing gimmick.\n\nIt's an organic creation that Americans want to buy, and she's worth the price.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

Once it became clear the Indiana Fever would be bringing Caitlin Clark to town, tickets for May 14 went quickly.\n\nThe secondary market is a different story. Nose-bleeds are out there for hundreds of dollars, courtside seats for thousands. The Sun front office is still getting media requests for the game, up to 89 by Friday.\n\nSo the Caitlin Clark Effect is real, and the impact of the star power coming into the WNBA is uplifting for all franchises, even the Sun, which has long been one of the league's more successful, on and off the court. Season ticket sales have roughly doubled for 2024.\n\nFrom Storrs to Seattle, UConn women's basketball players implement lessons from Kelsey Plum's Dawg Class\n\n\"As someone who has been around a long time, from the infancy of this league, it's fun to see,\" Sun coach Stephanie White said at training camp Friday. \"We've had moments when we've had some momentum, but this feels like a true movement, right? A true movement.\"\n\nIn Connecticut, women's basketball has been mainstream for decades, thanks to UConn, and when the landscape of the professional women's game settled in the mid-1990s with one league, the WNBA, Southeastern Connecticut became the base for one of the league's few stand-alone franchises.\n\nThe Sun averaged 6,244 per game last season in its 10,000-seat arena, holding steady between 6-8,000 throughout its 21-year history. The Las Vegas Aces, assembled as a super team that delivered a second straight championship, led the WNBA with 9,551 per game. Other franchises, in much larger markets, including New York (7,777), Chicago (7,242) and LA (6,554), drew marginally better than the Sun.\n\nBut the arrival of Clark, the all-time scoring leader in NCAA men's or women's basketball, from Iowa, Angel Reese from LSU, and with Paige Bueckers coming from UConn next year, has elevated a buzz to what now sounds like thumping speakers at a rock concert. TV viewership for the NCAA women's tournament shattered previous records, and the Iowa-South Carolina final, watched by 18.9 million, a 90 percent increase over 2023, got more eyeballs than the UConn-Purdue men's final (14.8 million). More than 2.4 million tuned in to the WNBA Draft to watch the formality of the Fever picking Clark No.1.\n\n\"Man, that was crazy, because we haven't seen that,\" said the Sun's DeWanna Bonner, who has been in the WNBA since 2009, when she was the No.5 pick overall. \"We've seen jumps here and there. But to see it jump off the table like that, that's amazing, because when I played (at Auburn) there was no social media, there was no talk about women's basketball. so to see this now is very exciting. Let's just keep it positive, we're all here for the same reason.\"\n\nPositive long-term ramifications could include WNBA expansion into places like Philadelphia or Boston, and increased TV revenue which would lead to better work conditions and higher salaries.\n\nLast season, mirroring the NBA's trend toward \"super teams,\" free agency and trades moved several of the best players in The W to Vegas, which could be the front-runner for an NBA expansion franchise one day, and New York, where the Liberty have yet to win a championship. With former UConn superstar Breanna Stewart, former Sun MVP Jonquel Jones, and Sabrina Ionescu, who was the biggest college star a few years ago, the Liberty reached the finals, but lost to the Aces.\n\nThe Sun retooled with White, the WNBA coach of the year, and made it to the semifinals, losing a competitive series to New York. With Alyssa Thomas, the MVP runner up to Stewart, Bonner and Brionna Jones back from her season-ending knee surgery, the Sun figure to be a contender again in 2024.\n\nAs Bonner touched on, social media, Instagram, TikTok, whatever the platform, has given women's stars like Clark, Reese and Bueckers a pop-icon status their predecessors didn't have. Talent and charisma, a little edginess here and there, it's a powerful combination.\n\nSo Mohegan hit the jackpot, in a manner of speaking, with its random drawing of Indiana for its opener. The Aces moved their games against Indiana from their 12,000-seat home to 18,000-seat T-Mobile; Washington, which plays in a 4,200-seat arena, is moving to 20,000 seat Capital One Arena for Clark's appearances. Certainly, the Sun-Fever game on May 14 could have sold out 15,000-seat XL, but it's staying put.\n\n\"I don't think there's a team in the league that's not excited about the attention being paid to the WNBA right now,\" said Jen Rizzotti, former UConn star and UHart coach, and now the Sun's president. \"If (Clark) walks in the building and we have 9,000 people and a sellout, they're also going to be seeing the Connecticut Sun play.\"\n\nDom Amore's Sunday Read: Jen Rizzotti loving Olympic 3-on-3 basketball; Sun vs. Caitlin Clark one hot ticket and more\n\nThe Sun report more than 1,100 new season-ticket subscriptions, bringing its base up to 2,500. The team has sold more than 20 percent of the individual game tickets for its 20 home games. Of course, former UConn players will becoming in with many of the visiting teams, including just-drafted Nika Muhl with Seattle and Aaliyah Edwards with Washington, and walk-up sales for games played in the middle of a casino always figure to be solid. But the season-ticket base suggests, as White said, a \"true movement,\" people coming to see the Sun and the WNBA for their own sakes.\n\n\"There are going to be new fans to our league,\" White said. \"Every year it happens a little bit more. I'm not sure that we've had a year where it's happening to this magnitude. It's the perfect intersection of players. great players, fan engagement, interaction, social media and just a heightened interest overall with carrying certain players from college to the NBA. The more and more we see the transfer portal, less affiliation with teams and more affiliation with players, you're going to continue to see that trend.\n\n\"So I'm excited about the opportunity for the new fans of the W to see our team, to see the players who have been playing in this league for a long time and welcoming them into the next level.\"", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType":

And after Clark got the ball off a screen late in the first quarter, she tried selling a call after getting elbowed.\n\nShe jumped backward and ended up on the deck while Caitlin drained a three. And with the offensive foul not getting called, it appeared that she got dropped by the latter. Clark went viral on social media right after.\n\nYou can see the play here:\n\nAlso Read: Everyone Is Losing Their Minds Over Perfectly-Timed Action Shot Of Caitlin Clark Leaving A Defender In An Uncomfortable Position During Her WNBA Debut\n\nThe above wasn't a great look for Jacy Sheldon, but all publicity is good publicity, so she got several more followers after the viral moment.\n\nSheldon and the Wings also got the win, beating the Fever 79-76. She scored both of her three-point attempts for six points in 13 minutes, adding two assists and one rebound.\n\nThanks to her moment with Caitlin Clark, Jacy's gotten a lot more attention than she might have had in preseason, as well as some traction on social media. You can see some of her best snaps right below:\n\nThe 23-year-old Ohio native was a five-star recruit ahead of her commitment to Ohio State, where she played from 2019 to 2024.\n\nShe was drafted by the Wings as the No. 5 overall pick this year.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lou_kavan_flavius@totalprosports.com", "name": "Lou Kavan Flavius", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacy_Sheldon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacy Sheldon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0478.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The WNBA's No. 1 selection has turned into a bona fide superstar in the sports world. As she prepares for her rookie campaign, many are wondering whether her talent is enough to carry the Indiana Fever to a championship so early in her career.\n\nThe Fever currently have the fifth-best odds to win the WNBA Championship this season. Indiana is priced at 23/1 at FanDuel Sportsbook following Clark's arrival, which is some decent value considering where this team was at the end of last year. Should bettors trust or fade Clark's Fever in this spot?\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook BET $5, WIN $200 BONUS BETS! IF YOUR BET WINS! 21+ and present in participating states. Gambling problem? Call 1-800-Gambler.\n\nShould bettors fade Caitlin Clark's Indiana Fever in their quest to win a WNBA Championship this season?\n\nIt's not often that teams go from worst to first in one year. It's only happened once in WNBA history when the Detroit Shock lifted the title in 2003 following a 9-23 campaign the season prior. They spoiled the Los Angeles Sparks' chance at a three-peat that year, something the Fever will be looking to rob the Los Vegas Aces of this season.\n\nWhile Indiana (13-27) was not the worst team in the WNBA last year, it was among the bottom dwellers. Only the Seattle Storm (11-29) and Phoenix Mercury (9-31) were worse. However, the Fever did finish in the basement of the Eastern Conference Standings.\n\nClark -- alongside reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston -- will be looking to turn the team's fortunes around this year. A tall task lies ahead of the dynamic duo, and while I believe they will lift many trophies throughout their careers, I recommend fading the Fever this season.\n\nIf you wanted to get in on the action and bet on a historic turnaround from Indiana, you missed the train. The Fever's odds to win the title at FanDuel Sportsbook were bet down from +3300 to +2300 in the last three days alone.\n\nClark and Boston are undoubtedly going to make some noise this season. Boston is only going to continue to improve and challenge for the unofficial title of the most dominant paint player in the league. Meanwhile, Clark (-700) is the runaway favorite to succeed her new teammate as the Rookie of the Year.\n\nA run at the postseason is in store for Indiana. Barring injury, a 13-27 campaign is no longer on the cards. However, a title challenge looks to be too hefty of an ask with such a young core.\n\nIf there is a team that could ascend the league standings in a short span, it'll likely be the Storm. Seattle added Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith to complement an already-established star in Jewell Lloyd. The experience on the Storm's roster gives them a much more realistic shot at title contention, as their +1000 odds display.\n\nFurthermore, the giants of the sport don't look ready to be dethroned just yet. A'ja Wilson and the Aces return their core as they look to become only the second team in league history to go back-to-back-to-back (Houston Comets, 1997 to 2000). Further, Breanna Stewart and the Liberty are desperate for the franchise's first title following a runner-up finish in 2023.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I recommend fading Clark and Co. in favor of another title contender with more experience, such as the Storm.\n\nThe 2024 WNBA regular season tips off on May 14 at 6 p.m. CT when the New York Liberty take on the Washington Mystics. Let's take a look at the title odds (as of May 6, 2024) via FanDuel Sportsbook:\n\n2024 WNBA Championship odds\n\nLas Vegas Aces (+100)\n\nNew York Liberty (+230)\n\nSeattle Storm (+1000)\n\nConnecticut Sun (+1200)\n\nIndiana Fever (+2300)\n\nDallas Wings (+2600)\n\nPhoenix Mercury (+2600)\n\nAtlanta Dream (+4200)\n\nMinnesota Lynx (+4200)\n\nChicago Sky (+6500)\n\nWashington

The video caption by the Fever read, \"Caitlin Clark shakes off the defender and buries her fourth three of the half \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udca8\"\n\nThe post has 1.4 million impressions, and it sparked a round of criticism before people realized he was joking and actually defending Clark through sarcasm.\n\nIn fact, Eickholt was actually criticizing another writer, Doug Gottlieb, who had been critical of Clark previously, according to The Spun.\n\nThe Fox Sports Radio host had posted on X, \"The amount of work it takes to be consistent through her mechanical flaw is really impressive. If you were advising her, would you fix it in the offseason? @HoopConsultants.\" And he was serious.\n\nEickholt's X profile reads, \"The Iowa Hawkeye Insider for @247Sports and @CBSSports || Host of #Swarmcast.\"\n\nThe writer made it clear that his post was sarcasm. \"Oh my god -- people are actually taking this serious,\" he wrote in the replies under the post after it went viral.\n\n\"Homey missed the joke,\" another person agreed on X, referring to a critic of the post. \"Lot of them did \ud83d\ude02\" Eickholt wrote. \"We are supposed to research some rando before replying?\" another person laughed.\n\nIn the replies, some people took the joke seriously and were critical. \"*breaks every D-1 scoring record* but hey her shot form sucks huh?\" wrote one.\n\n\"The closest I've been to a WNBA game is walking through a Las Vegas casino with my wife on vacay. The haters seem determined to keep the WNBA an afterthought. Here you have all these new people looking their way, and still you spew,\" wrote another.\n\n\"Don't think it's smart to comment something like that when she made the basket \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 just a thought,\" another fan wrote.\n\nEickholt has shared some of the negative tweets he received in response, including, \"She's hoopin, and your wastin your energy trying to bring her down. Mannn, who hurt you? Empowering goes so much further than negativity.\"\n\nHe responded, \"It's very abundantly clear who has come across my tweets and who hasn't. These comments have me rolling \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\"\n\nOthers wrote that Eickholt should have done more to make it clear his post was sarcasm. \"Use quotes or emojis or some s***. There are ways to indicate sarcasm,\" wrote another X user that Eickholt shared. Eickholt responded, \"Or you could see I covered her high school and college career for a living. Not that hard.\"\n\nDespite the comment, Eickholt has also posted positively about Clark on X. \"Former Hawkeye Caitlin Clark shined in her WNBA debut, finishing with 21 points and showcasing her range. Despite the loss, there are plenty of reasons for optimism in Indianapolis,\" he wrote after the joke.\n\nEickholt's post linked to an article he wrote about Clark's debut for 247Sports. \"One of the most highly-anticipated debuts in women's sports history occurred on Friday night when Iowa native Caitlin Clark took the floor for her Indiana Fever. Clark, who has been the biggest reason for the growth of women's basketball, dazzled in her opening game,\" his story for \"Hawkeye Insider\" says.\n\nAnother person defended Eickholt, writing, \"I don't think the majority of the country outside of Iowa knows you are a fan of iowa lol.

She is only the third retired WNBA player to move into ownership, joining Lisa Leslie (Los Angeles Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream).\n\nBird's move comes during a time in which the sports of women's basketball -- at both the professional and collegiate levels -- is on an upswing, assuming the spotlight and picking up momentum across fans of all ages, genders and backgrounds.\n\nNow, one key question remains: How does the sport keep the momentum going?\n\n\"I don't think the moment comes in the form of, 'Oh, it's starting to grow,'\" Bird, also a co-founder of sports media company TOGETHXR and production company A Touch More, told CBS Sports. \"I can talk about my experience [at UConn]. My Final Four, which was 22 years ago, there were 30,000 people at that game. But why didn't it continue to grow? Because no investment, because no coverage. ...\n\n\"I walked into an arena with 30,000 people. I leave, I go into the WNBA, and now everyone is telling me nobody cares. That never added up.\"\n\nThe math is finally making sense. The 2024 WNBA Draft was seen a record-breaking 2.45 million viewers; this as the league prepares for what might be one of the best seasons in its history.\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert is hoping the league can capitalize off this momentum.\n\n\"We hope to at least double our rights fees,\" Engelbert told CNBC. \"Women's sports rights fees have been undervalued for too long, so we have this enormous opportunity at a time where the media landscape is changing so much.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Engelbert said she is \"pretty confident\" the WNBA will expand to 16 teams by 2028. Currently, half of all players selected during the WNBA Draft don't make the cut because there are not enough roster spots.\n\nAfter leading the UConn Huskies to a pair of national championships, Bird was selected No. 1 overall in the 2002 WNBA Draft. She went on to spend the next 20 seasons with the Storm before retiring in 2022. She didn't stay away too long, still hoping to help her team succeed even without being on the court.\n\n\"As a player, I poured my heart into every game for the Seattle Storm, and now, as part of the ownership group, I am thrilled to continue contributing to the growth of the game,\" Bird said upon acquiring her ownership stake.\n\n\"Investing in women's sports isn't just about passion; it's smart business. It's about recognizing the immense talent, dedication, and market potential our league has always had. Force 10 Hoops and the Storm have been at the forefront of this for decades. Together, we're not just shaping the future of basketball, but also paving the way for a more equitable and inclusive society.\"\n\nNBA, WNBA players with team ownership stakesPlayerTeamYear\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nCharlotte Bobcats/Hornets (NBA)\n\n2006\n\nLisa LeslieLos Angeles Sparks (WNBA)\n\n2011\n\nMagic Johnson\n\nLos Angeles Sparks (WNBA)\n\n2014\n\nGrant Hill\n\nAtlanta Hawks (NBA)\n\n2015\n\nRenee Montgomery\n\nAtlanta Dream (WNBA)\n\n2021\n\nDwayne Wade\n\nUtah Jazz (NBA)\n\n2021\n\nSue Bird\n\nSeattle Storm (WNBA)\n\n2024", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabel_gonzalez@cbssports.com", "name": "Isabel Gonzalez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sue Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renee_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renee Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Leslie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Leslie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/06/d9c00369-7b43-4309-9bb3-9cf53ab0b04f/thumbnail/1200x675/2fa9131804a1af1b536fc651e22907b9/sue-bird-suit-g.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

It's technically an acronym, which stands for \"before anyone else\".\n\nClark initially didn't understand the question. So the reporter rephrased by saying, \"Is 'bae' gonna be here?\"\n\n\"Uh no, he's working,\" the 2024 WNBA Draft's No. 1 overall pick responded.\n\nYeah, I'm flying solo. I better get used to it, man,\" she added with a smile. \"This is the pros, this is my job.\"\n\nSo although we might not see McCaffrey at Fever games in the near future, it seems Clark and her \"bae\" are still going strong.\n\nLike Clark, McCaffrey is a name that conveys basketball royalty at the University of Iowa.\n\nAlbeit not because of Connor.\n\nConnor's dad Fran McCaffrey has been the Iowa men's basketball head coach since 2010. On January 15, McCaffrey became the winningest coach of Iowa men's basketball history, per The Athletic.\n\nMcCaffrey currently has a 280-181 record coaching at Iowa, and has a career 531-368 record across 28 seasons coaching four different teams.\n\nConnor spent six years playing for his father at Iowa, and was a starting guard for three seasons. He averaged 6.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.3 steals per game in 32 appearances during the 2022-23 season.\n\n\"It's a way in. It's an entry-level job,\" said McCaffery of the Pacers job, per ESPN. \"You've got to work hard and work your way up. That's obviously what I want to do.\"\n\nPerhaps it was divine intervention that Clark was drafted into the same city where McCaffrey is now coaching.\n\nYet, since McCaffrey's Pacers team still is in the NBA Playoffs, he has clearly been too busy to watch Clark live.\n\nThe Fever's first home game is on May 9. The Pacers have an away game in New York on May 8. But they'll then return to Indianapolis for a home game on May 10.\n\nTherefore, perhaps McCaffrey can spare the night of May 9 to watch his girlfriend's home debut.\n\nHer boyfriend's absence didn't stop Clark from a dominant WNBA debut on May 3.\n\nIn 28 minutes played against the Dallas Wings, Clark scored 21 points, including shooting 5 of 13 from three point range.\n\nAmong Clark's best moments in the game were her scoring her first career WNBA points with a deep three pointer.\n\nClark's excellent showing wasn't enough to get Indiana the preseason win. Yet, it did show any doubters that her college scoring will translate in the WNBA.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_young@heavy.com", "name": "Grant Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151503327-e1714921576395.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537457", "eventUri": "eng-9537457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-15", "textStart": 948, "textEnd": 958}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1843, "textEnd": 1848, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1894, "textEnd": 1899}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1960, "textEnd": 1966}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2138, "textEnd": 2143}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Omaha Productions collaborated with NFL Films to produce \"Quarterback,\" a series that followed Kirk Cousins, Patrick Mahomes, and Marcus Mariota throughout the 2022 season, and Manning himself hosts a show called \"Peyton's Places,\" where he breaks down different moments in sports history.\n\nInsider: Final shot aside, Caitlin Clark showed how much of a game-changer she can be\n\nHe wanted to do the same thing with women's college basketball, which was on the rise to be the most popular it has ever been. So, he pitched the idea to Clark at Iowa, Kamilla Cardoso at South Carolina and Kiki Rice at UCLA to see if they wanted to participate in a documentary following them throughout the 2023-24 season. All of them said yes.\n\nThe idea coming from Manning, a legend in a different sport, showed how much the game has grown since Clark, Cardoso and Rice started their college careers.\n\n\"I think there's always other women's basketball legends supporting women's basketball, that's never been the issue, it's like almost other sports, and I think that's grown so much,\" Clark said following Indiana Fever practice Monday. \"Whether it's football players, whether it's men's basketball players, whether it's golfers, swimmers, you can go down the list of the amount of professional athletes or even just public figures, famous public figures that are now supporting women's basketball, investing in women's basketball... for me, that's the coolest thing.\"\n\nThe docuseries starts with Iowa's historic scrimmage against DePaul, which the Hawkeyes held at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Over 55,000 fans attended, doubling the women's college basketball attendance record. The show follows the three players through their respective seasons and ends with the WNBA draft in Brooklyn, where Clark went No. 1 overall to the Fever and Cardoso went No. 3 to the Chicago Sky. Rice was a sophomore at UCLA through the 2023-24 season, so she was not eligible for the draft.\n\nAlong with the three players, it also features their teammates, coaches and families.\n\nThe show, which Clark was also an executive producer on, premieres Monday night at the Tobias Theater at Newfields in Indianapolis. Clark, Cardoso, Rice and Manning are all scheduled to be at the premiere. Clark said her coaches from Iowa are also planning to attend.\n\nWith this docuseries, Clark said, fans will get a better look at what happens in their lives; more than the on-court action or news conferences online. It will show both sides of the national championship game, as well -- Cardoso won the championship with South Carolina, while Clark and Iowa fell short.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing was just that you can see what we do outside of basketball,\" Clark said. \"When you're in college, you come and see us twice a week, see us play for two hours on the court. That's really all you get, you don't get anything else. Now you get to see a little more into our lives; you don't get to see every single second of our lives, but you're getting to see a lot of things that had maybe never been shown before, conversations people didn't know we had or interactions with family members, coaches, or teammates or fans, whatever it is, or how you're prepping for certain games like March Madness, a lot of that is covered. It's not something a lot of people will get to see, whether it's from the normal media or coming and watching us in-person, so it's definitely a different glimpse for fans or viewers.\"\n\nFor Clark

Roasting records. Taking the \"hand heart\" to Swiftian levels.\n\nCaitlin Clark has changed the face of basketball, bringing a groundswell of excitement to the sport. That well-deserved and carefully cultivated hype has resulted in a slew of Clark-adjacent conversations. From an increase in ticket sales to a boom in women's apparel stock to the creation of CC-specific betting props, the fever is real.\n\nThe odds for success certainly favor Clark, and that's great for the WNBA. But how can bettors cash in on the fun? Here are five prop bets to consider heading into Clark's highly anticipated rookie campaign:\n\nLines from ESPN BET as of time of publication.\n\nIt's ponytails over pistols for me. Clark broke Pete Maravich's record for the most points scored by a Division I basketball player (3,667) in March, racking up 3,951 points over her stellar college career. The Iowa legend also bested Kelsey Plum's single season points record (1,109), averaging 28.42 points per outing in 2023. Of course expectations are sky high, but are they realistic? Is the hype inflating the market?\n\nI lean towards the latter. Only three players -- Jewell Loyd, Breanna Stewart, and A'Ja Wilson -- cleared this line last season. All three of them are stars. None of them are rookies. In order for Clark to register 850 points, she'd have to average 21.25 points per game. But just two rookies in WNBA history have managed that many points per contest (Cynthia Cooper in 1997 and Seimone Augustus in 2006).\n\nClark, undoubtedly, has the talent to produce, but she's also coming off of a rigorous few months in college before diving straight into her first pro campaign.\n\nThe rookie wall is real. So is the likelihood of her smashing this total in year two.\n\n548. That's the number of 3-pointers Clark sunk over her college career. Nearly 37% of those buckets (201) came in her final year as a Hawkeye. There's no doubt Clark's long-range shooting prowess will be called upon in the pros, particularly when noting that the Fever made the third-fewest number of 3-pointers (269) in 2023.\n\nBut 135 3s is a lot. A number that high would break the single-season record, which was set by Sabrina Ionescu last year. The Liberty star made 128 shots from beyond the arc, averaging 3.6 3PM per game. She missed four games due to injury, but was also a fourth-year guard playing on a team with the fifth-highest pace. Ionescu isn't the league's only long-range shooting star, of course. Diana Taurasi can still deal from downtown and remains the last player to lead the league in threes in back-to-back years (2016-18). Taurasi hit that milestone over a decade into her career.\n\nIt is well within reason to assume Clark will record triple-digit 3s in her first pro campaign. She could even average up to 3.0 3-point shots per contest (which was the second-highest 3PM average in 2023, posted by Loyd). Managing that lofty bar, however, would still only put Clark at 120 total 3PM over a 40-game season. The math just doesn't work on this one.\n\nWinning is still winning even if the payout is more pocket change than bag sized. Plus, after so many unders it might feel refreshing to align with the bandwagoners. Clark isn't just a heavy favorite for ROY, she also has the third-shortest odds to win the WNBA regular season MVP (+900, behind Wilson and Stewart).\n\nThe former Hawkeye's popularity isn't the only factor in making her such a shoo-in for ROY honors. She was the first overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft and two most recent No. 1 overall picks also earned Rookie of the Year honors: Aliyah Boston in 2023 and Rhyne Howard in 2022. In fact, the No. 1 pick has won the ROY award in 11 of the past 16 seasons.\n\nClark's addition to the Fever will certainly lift the squad. She's not only an ace shooter, but she's also a dazzling facilitator. Surrounded by more talent -- including the aforementioned dynamo, Boston -- Clark won't need to carry the team every contest. That figures to boost the Fever's win total by a significant number. Indiana will, absolutely, best their 13-27 record from last year. But they are unlikely to add eight wins.\n\nFor context, only four teams won more than 20 games last year. Two of them included the conference champions; the Aces and Liberty. Speaking of the Liberty, New York went from 16 to 32 wins from 2022 to 2023. However, the front office was able to accomplish that feat by creating a super-team of seasoned vets that included Stewart, Jonquel Jones and Courtney Vandersloot.\n\nThis is not that. Indiana is on the way to being a contender, but this line is too elevated to reach for.\n\nThere's no doubt that the Fever are improving. Clark's aptitude as a (long-range) shooter as well as her ability to dole out dimes should help Indiana space the floor. These were two areas in which the team struggled (third-fewest 3s per game and second-fewest assists) last season. An ascent is, therefore, imminent.\n\nThe club also added Katie Lou Samuelson (who was on maternity leave last season) and Damiris Dantas. Samuelson managed a career effort with the Sparks back in 2022, averaging nearly 10 points and 3 points per effort. Dantas, for her part, missed significant time due to injury and personal reasons, but her presence adds depth and veteran savvy to this young team.\n\nThe Fever are evolving and figure to finish inside the top-eight clubs, securing a spot in (at least) Round One.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

People already have plenty to say about WNBA salaries, and now the conversation has shifted to charter flights. Again.\n\nCharter flights are a known issue that became a hot-button topic after a Brittney Griner incident last year but have resurfaced with the introduction of stars like Caitlin Clark.\n\nAt some point -- perhaps when players can opt out of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) by November 1, 2024 -- the WNBA will have to address charter flights fully.\n\nIf Brittney Griner and her teammates being harassed at DFW Airport in 2023 -- to the point that legitimate security concerns surfaced -- wasn't enough to shift the conversation, perhaps Caitlin Clark, Aliyah Boston and their Fever teammates walking through that same airport in 2024 might help the whispers become full-on screams.\n\nIn 2023, the league announced it would offer charter flights during back-to-back regular season games and through the playoffs. Admittedly, that helped, but it won't immediately solve the security concerns or many other issues that come with athletes flying commercial, including additional travel hours and loss of recovery time, as Dallas Wings star Satou Sabally pointed out last season.\n\nAlso, the hefty price tag associated with providing charter flights for all 12 WNBA teams could make this an eyesore for quite some time.Per ESPN's Mike Voepel, WBNA commissioner Cathy Engelbert acknowledged that footing that bill could be an uphill battle.\n\nHere's what Engelbert shared last year:\n\n\"And the thing some people are missing is that this isn't a one-year funding,\" Engelbert told ESPN. \"This is something you've got to fund -- I want to say in perpetuity -- but let's say you have to make sure you have a business model to fund it for at least a decade.\n\n\"So even if you brought a sponsor in to fund it one year ... sponsors can come and go.

He journeyed to Italy to escape from the mounting pressure of life. It's something Clark can identify with. The culmination of his marriage breaking down after six years, and the knock-on effect of stopping work for the first time in 10 years, sent Clark into a \"downward spiral\", he says.\n\n\"I tried to finish myself off. I didn't eat. I went down to 9 stone (57kg). I'm 6ft 4in (1.9m), I looked horrendous,\" he says.\n\nGrateful for everything he has built, having grown up in a council house in Stepney Green, east London, with not very much, Clark says he would give it all up not to have put his mother, Linda, through the trauma of that difficult time.\n\n\"She's a 70-year-old woman and she had to watch her successful son literally disintegrate.\"\n\nHe adds that starting afresh - going out on dates when you're in the public eye - brings with it its own difficulties.\n\n\"I always thought when I was younger, imagine being known, you'd probably be able to get anyone you want. It's the complete opposite,\" he says.\n\nRinder, a criminal barrister who rose to prominence as a TV judge, had been with his partner for 11 years, but his relationship broke down four years into their marriage.\n\nFor him, one of the hardest things to do is live in the moment, rather than in his head.\n\n\"Recently, I went on a date and I thought it had gone rather well, and he said, 'Well I did rather feel like I was being cross-examined',\" he says.\n\n\"I'm one of life's great overthinkers, it stops me doing everything. It stops me finding joy, it stops me taking risks.\"\n\nOn his arrival in Italy, Byron fell in love. Like the original tourists on the Grand Tour, Rinder and Clark met up with prospective love interests too, taking themselves out of their comfort zone to date Venetian men. But they also studied the art, architecture and culture of the historic Italian cities.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I know a lot about art,\" says Clark. \"I come from quite a working-class background and art wasn't the thing that we had hanging up in our houses. It would be fake chandeliers from down the market - that was our family heirlooms.\"\n\nRinder comes from a working-class background too and was brought up by his single-parent mother.\n\n\"Opera wasn't on the buffet - or ballet or books,\" he says. \"Really for me, education - be it in the music or the arts - it was the way out.\"\n\nAlthough Rinder has studied art, the Grand Tour was not just about him educating Clark, but Clark educating him, he says.\n\n\"Every painting we've looked at, some of which I've seen multiple times, he's found something new and beautiful in it,\" he says.\n\nFor Clark, the tour has given him the confidence to not feel intimidated to talk about art any more. He has made no secret, he says, of the fact he didn't have that much confidence in himself.\n\nJust as carnival guests in Venice would wear make-up to conceal their identities, Clark says he too wears a mask every day in the form of make-up.\n\n\"I'm very much two people,\" says Clark. \"So everyone knows me as Rylan - has a laugh, big teeth, wears a bit of make-up - a lot of make-up - and is just that presenter off the telly - or that idiot off the telly.\n\n\"Whereas actually at home, I'm Ross. Ross is who I grew up as, Rylan's my job. Ross is the one that sits at home with a tracksuit on and a Peroni in the hand, so I am very different.\"\n\nHe says the make-up he wears is his suit of armour.\n\n\"So you can take the piss out of my teeth, you can say I look orange, but at the end of the day when I wipe it all off, Ross isn't bruised, Rylan takes the battering, that's how I deal with it.\"\n\nFor Clark, who loves design and says he wanted to be an architect growing up, the trip has given him the chance to redefine himself.\n\n\"When you're 'something', people want you to be that 'something' and stay in your lane, sometimes it's nice to indicate, slip over,\" he says.\n\nIt does feel like he and Rinder have had a renaissance of their own on the trip.\n\n\"I've got no limits now, nothing fazes me,\" says Clark. \"I'm willing to try anything - or anyone.\"\n\n\"I'm 34 and I'm young enough to start again when it comes down to my personal life.\"\n\nThe experience has been just as liberating for Rinder.\n\n\"I feel like I've learnt living life can't just be in books, it's got to be real,\" he says.\n\n\"You can't write about love, or paint about it, unless you've done it.\"\n\nRob and Rylan's Grand Tour starts

She scored 21 points for the Fever in a 79-76 preseason loss to the Dallas Wings, which drew national attention.\n\n\"The atmosphere,\" Clark told reporters about what she remembers most from the May 3 game. \"I remember my first game in college really well, too ... this is a big milestone for me, I've always dreamed of playing in the WNBA.\"\n\nIndiana made Clark the No. 1 pick in this year's draft after a stellar college career where she became a national sensation at Iowa. Clark led the Hawkeyes to a pair of Final Four appearances, which drew record ratings, and she hit the NCAA's all-time scoring record.\n\n\"My biggest goal coming into tonight was to continue to be myself, play aggressive,\" Clark said. \"I thought that's what I did. I think there's a lot to be proud of.\"\n\nClark buried her first shot, an extra-long three-pointer. She continued her strong play throughout which included three rebounds, two assists, and two steals in 28 minutes of play.\n\n\"I was able to get a pretty clean look for my first shot,\" Clark said. \"It's always nice to see your first shot go in when you're a shooter.\"\n\nThe last one didn't go in for Clark and the Fever unfortunately. She missed a last-second three-pointer that would have tied the game at the end of regulation, but Clark kept the preseason defeat in perspective afterward.\n\n\"There's a lot of good to take away from it. At the same time, it's a preseason game, so don't get too disappointed by it,\" Clark said. \"Just go back and watch the film, learn from it and get ready for our next one.\"\n\nShe also expressed her appreciation of the game overall itself despite the loss.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better game, really, for women's basketball to kick off this year,\" Clark said. \"A tremendous game coming down to the wire, both teams competing. That's going to be the story of the entire year.\"\n\nIndiana played many close games last season, a theme that came up when Fever head coach Christie Sides spoke with the media.\n\n\"This is when you fix things. You play these games so you can fix some of the things,\" Sides said.\n\nIndiana has a few days to regroup before a preseason home opener on May 9 against the Atlanta Dream. Atlanta won its preseason opener 87-84 over the Washington Mystics on May 4.\n\nThe Dream recently added former WNBA Rookie of the Year Crystal Dangerfield to the lineup after a trade with the Wings.

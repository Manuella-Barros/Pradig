Barstool founder Dave Portnoy unloaded on X, calling it, \u201cthe dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d after multiple reports said the Indiana Fever rookie would not make the 12-player roster. \u201cHow dumb are these people?\u201d Portnoy added. \u201cNever complain about women salaries ever again. Make that team fly commercial. Unreal dumb.\u201d Portnoy further railed against the decision in a two-plus minute video rant. \u201cI\u2019d rather watch grass grow, I\u2019d rather watch paint dry. I\u2019d rather watch dirt just be moved around because Caitlin Clark is not on the team,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she\u2019s there, it\u2019s appointment TV. You people, whoever did this, take your brain, put it in a museum and study it for how dumb you are.\u201d Colin Cowherd compared Clark to Christian Laettner, who was part of the 1992 Dream Team coming right out of college at Duke. \u201cChristian Laettner made the Dream Team. Caitlin Clark can\u2019t make the women\u2019s Olympic basketball team?\u201d Cowherd, the Fox Sports host, wrote. \u201cWhat mostly pays for the Olympics \u2014 oh wait \u2014 revenue generated from broadcasting partners. As in TV. As in Caitlin is TV GOLD. Opportunity wasted.\u201d Justine Termine of Sirius XM pointed out how silly it is for a sport that is trying to grow to not have someone as popular as Clark. \u201cEven if she stinks, which she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s horrible vision,\u201d he posted. US soccer legend Alexei Lalas had a rather blunt take on the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about USA women\u2019s Olympic basketball to know if Caitlin Clark\u2019s omission is a snub. I do know that, right now, she would be the only reason I would remotely care about USA women\u2019s Olympic basketball,\u201d he wrote. Michele Tafoya called it a \u201clost opportunity,\u201d writing that it was a chance to not only grow the sport, but create interest. She went as far as to call the decision \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the sport. The news of Clark\u2019s commission, which is not official yet, comes after her fantastic performance on Friday night. She equaled a WNBA rookie record with seven 3-pointers for the Fever in front of the largest WNBA crowd in 17 years of 20,333 in Washington, D.C. Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve, who will coach Team USA this summer, reportedly wanted to go with a more veteran roster, according to reports. She was critical during the preseason of the WNBA\u2019s heavy focus on Clark. Five-time gold medalist Diana Taurasi was reportedly invited, along with Phoenix Mercury teammate Brittney Griner. Olympic veterans such as Breanna Stewart, A\u2019ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd and Chelsea Gray will also be on the team. Clark\u2019s absence, though, is the major story. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you leave the country without her,\u201d four-time Olympic gold medalist Lisa Leslie told The Sporting News in April. Team USA\u2019s decision-makers apparently found a way.", "summary": "Caitlin Clark's Olympic team snub predictably got shredded on social media by Dave Portnoy and the sports world.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/sports/dave-portnoy-slams-unreal-dumb-caitlin-clark-2024-olympics-snub/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-ljy6ebbwc-1717863079347.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717848842&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:41:16", "author": "Zach Braziller", "authors": ["Zach Braziller"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.005}

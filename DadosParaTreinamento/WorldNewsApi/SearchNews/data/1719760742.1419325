{"id": 225027554, "title": "Recklessly uttering that public servant was &#8216;cheater, corrupt&#8217; not abuse but defamation: Bombay HC", "text": "Observing that recklessly uttering that public servant was 'cheater, corrupt' can hardly be said to be a form of abuse but instead constitutes defamation, the Bombay High Court recently refused to set aside proceedings against a real estate agent for shouting in presence of few persons that the police officer was 'corrupt and cheater' despite being exonerated by ACB. The bench noted that defamation proceedings were justified as the accused was aware that Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) had closed an inquiry against the cop on allegations of disproportionate assets. A single-judge bench of Justice N J Jamadar passed a verdict earlier this month in a plea by the accused Naresh Kanayalal Rajwani challenging December, 2022 order passed by the sessions judge whereby his revision application against the February, 2019 order of Magistrate court to initiate proceedings against him under section 500 (punishment for defamation) of IPC was dismissed. The complainant was working as police official for nearly 30 years till 2009 and when he was posted as Police Sub-Inspector (PSI) at Chembur Police station, he became acquainted with Rajwani who was a real estate agent. In 2011, the retired cop and his family members approached the accused to purchase shops and a dispute arose between them and Rajwani. As per the complainant cop, Rajwani made false and vexatious allegations and wrote to the superior of the cop and the ACB claiming that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known source of income. He later approached HC in 2016 with a writ petition seeking registration of FIR against the ex-cop, which was dismissed by court in 2017. The ACB conducted an open inquiry against the ex-cop and closed the inquiry in 2018 as it could not find disproportionate assets and informed the businessman about the same. As per the ex- police officer who ran a medical and general store, in May, 2018, Rajwani came to his shop and the presence of few known persons, workers in the shop and customers, he shouted 2-3 times about the ex-cop being corrupt, which prompted the complainant to lodge a defamation case and the magistrate initiated proceedings in the same in 2019. After the sessions court upheld the magistrate's decision, the aggrieved Rajwani approached the HC last year. Advocates Abhinav Chandrachud and Snehal Chaudhari for the accused claimed that utterances were not made with intent to harm the reputation of the complainant and were at best abusive but not defamatory. \"Hurling of abuses without intent to harm the reputation of the person to whom the abuses are hurled does not constitute defamation,\" he argued. However, Justice Jamadar observed that \"the accused knew that the concerned investigating authority found no substance in the allegations, and, yet the accused made the said imputation.\" \"In the backdrop of the surrounding circumstances, especially the dismissal of the writ petition and the exoneration by the ACB, the imputation can only be said to have, prima facie, been made with intent to harm the reputation of the complainant, thus, satisfying the criteria mentioned in section 499 of IPC. Prima facie, the element of good faith was non-existent. To utter that a public servant was cheater and corrupt, can hardly be said to be a form of abuse. Instead, if made recklessly and sans good faith, such imputation, prima facie, constitutes defamation,\" the bench observed and dismissed the plea.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-recklessly-uttering-public-servant-was-cheater-corrupt-defamation-9359529/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/bombay-hc-5.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:54:49", "author": "Omkar Gokhale", "authors": ["Omkar Gokhale"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.386}

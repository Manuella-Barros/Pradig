Her tour, entitled 'Out of the Box', will see her perform from September to November 2024 in various UK locations, starting in Lichfield and wrapping up in Stafford.\n\nCombining singing, comedy, and quizzing elements, Jenny recently discussed her tour on Good Morning Britain.\n\nRanvir Singh, a GMB host, was eager to discover if Jenny would go back to The Chase, and Jenny confirmed that she indeed would. She expressed how it feels daunting to reveal her \"softer\" side during the tour after years of portraying a \"stern\" figure on the quiz show.\n\nThe tour's official synopsis describes an evening where Jenny, known for her formidable persona as The Vixen on The Chase, steps out from behind the television screen offering an array of entertainment, including songs, anecdotes, and perhaps even some industry insider knowledge.\n\nAnticipated to share music and personal stories live on stage, Jenny is also set to showcase the powerful vocal talent that impressed the judges on X Factor Celebrity, reports the Mirror.\n\nWhile speaking to GMB hosts Ed Balls, Ranvir, and entertainment reporter Scarlette Douglas, Jenny revealed:\"We took the show to Edinburgh Fringe last year really on sort of a whim.\n\n\"It's a big risk to take something like this, as presenters know, after a stern role and you try something new. It's a bit of a challenge for people to change their expectations and perceptions of you.\"\n\nEd quickly added his experience with a joking note: \"Tell me about it!\" referring to his own shift from politics to television presenting.\n\nJenny then expanded on her own experiences, illustrating her vulnerability in embracing a different public persona: \"Putting myself out there to show a softer side of me putting everything out there, my background, everything... was a bit of a risk. We sold out [at the Fringe] and we got such excellent feedback.\"\n\nInterjecting, Ranvir posed an intriguing question to Jenny: \"Jenny, can I ask... are you worried? Because presumably you're going to go back onto The Chase? Are you worried that people won't be as scared of you because they'll have seen a softer side?\"\n\nWith a light-hearted response, Jenny confirmed her return to the ITV quiz show and chuckled at the idea suggested by Ranvir.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jess_phillips@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Jess Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chase_(British_game_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Chase (British game show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vixen_(drag_queen)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Vixen (drag queen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranvir_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranvir Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stafford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stafford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlette_Douglas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scarlette Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The X Factor (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Balls", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fringe (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29647065.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_screenshot-2024-07-31-at-081853.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778278", "eventUri": "eng-9778278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

mostly for my own benefit and my own mental health and singing with my little ukulele group - but to do that show and to get the validation of the British public who voted me all the way to the final, it was life changing because I realised not only does singing bring me joy, it brings a lot of other people joy,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Jenny promised she would be back on The Chase and reunited with her fellow Chasers soon.\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_allday@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jasmine Allday", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chase_(British_game_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Chase (British game show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vixen_(drag_queen)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Vixen (drag queen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabaret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichfield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lichfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lichfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Festival Fringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andover,_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andover, Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andover, Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runcorn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Runcorn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Runcorn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Shields", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Shields"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Shields"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taunton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taunton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taunton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The X Factor (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukulele", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukulele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33363392.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GMB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778278", "eventUri": "eng-9778278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

reveals home robbery", "body": "Watch the video to see the ITV star's sage words of advice after the ordeal\n\nTHE Chase star Jenny Ryan issued a stark warning to Good Morning Britain viewers as she detailed a horror robbery at her London home.\n\nThe quiz champion, known as The Vixen on the ITV game show, told how \"irreplaceable\" items were swiped from her bedroom in \"a moment of loss of concentration.\"\n\nJenny, 42, was on Wednesday's Good Morning Britain to talk about her new cabaret show.\n\nYet after the light-hearted banter about the tour, talk turned to more serious matters as the I'm A Celeb alumni opened up on the shock crime.\n\nShe told of the \"robbery scam\" and said she had a knock on the door from a workman, who said there was a leak in the flat upstairs and he needed to take some photos.\n\nThe Chase favourite Jenny said: \"He didn't just take some photos, he took my phone and some jewellery that was irreplaceable.\n\n\"It was made for me as a gift by my mum and step dad.\"\n\nIssuing a warning to GMB viewers she continued: \"It was a moment of losing concentration, of probably being too polite, of not wanting to say 'no let me see your ID, wait there.'\n\n\"I just wanted it to be over and by that time he was in my house, he has shut himself in my bedroom and was rifling though my stuff.\"\n\nThe brainbox told how it was the work of \"professional criminals\" who target vulnerabilities.\n\nJenny, recalling the troubling time earlier this year, said: \"I just think people should be on their guard of anything that seems out of the ordinary.\n\n\"If your hackles are up, then don't be afraid to be impolite, just say no and it probably wont happen to you - hopefully.\"\n\nJenny told GMB anchors Ed Balls and Ranvir Singh how she realised she'd been robbed \"as soon as he was out the door.\"\n\nShe dubbed it a \"really clever bit of scam\" detailing how the criminal had at first left the bedroom door open, showing the phone perched on the sheets, before shutting it and swiping it.\n\nPreviously, the red-head told how she was \"scared to stay in my house\" following the ordeal.\n\nIn a chat on BBC Morning Live which aired in April, she told how she had reported the theft to the police but has hit out at their response and support so far.\n\nShe added at the time: \"I've told them that there are probably fingerprints because he moved furniture, there's lots of CCTV on my street and I know exactly where he went because I had the phone on tracker.\n\n\"What I really wanted was a police officer or someone from the local force to call me and make sure I was ok because it's a very scary thing, I was feeling very vulnerable.\"\n\nIn 2023, she starred in an episode of Celebrity Escape to the Country and became emotional when she talked of relocating \"back home.\"\n\nJenny and partner Tom Tuck opened up to presenter Jules Hudson about their plans to move from the city to the countryside near her hometown, Bolton.\n\nShe made London her home after signing up to The Chase and filming episodes in the UK capital.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors":

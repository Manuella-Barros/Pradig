Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military aid package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military aid package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favour in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill also includes about US$26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defence spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than US$20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a US$1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe US$61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military aid package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n''It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,'' said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. ''Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.''\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza ''without delay.''\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he ''would encourage'' Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want'' to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting ''American and European soldiers at increased risk.'' But in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime-time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted weeks earlier at the urging of restive legislators on the right.\n\nFar-right Republicans have adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a monthslong, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. On explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they ''stepped up and did the right thing.''\n\n''History will remember this moment,\" he said.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to ''just keep talking, keep working,'' according to a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting to Kyiv additional weaponry that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n''I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed,'' Bowman said, \"but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S. Republicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

Next is the Senate\n\nBut significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid. Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military aid package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nPast coverage: Bill that could ban TikTok passes House, Wash. lawmakers weigh in\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far-right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime-time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far-right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nMore context: US aid to Ukraine hinges on House Speaker Johnson. His leadership is being tested by the far right\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as a direct and honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff was in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

Despite Republican delays, the aid package is expected to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. The measure also includes humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza and a deadline for TikTok's sale due to national security concerns. Despite Republican opposition, funding for Ukraine was secured through negotiations and Biden's strategy of avoiding pressure on Speaker Johnson. Experts emphasize the need for sustained support for Ukraine to avoid Russian success and maintain stability in the region.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law on Wednesday a USD 95 billion war aid measure that includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that also includes a provision that would force social media site TikTok to be sold or be banned in US.\n\nThe announcement marks an end to long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"We rose to the moment. we came together. and we got it done,'' Biden said at White House event to announce the signing. ''Now we need to move fast, and we are.\" But significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's brutal invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid. Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours'' -- the first tranche from about USD 61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to US officials.\n\nIt is expected to include air defence capabilities, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favour in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\" Tucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep US data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\" Biden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay\".\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city, pummelling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said on Tuesday. ''Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\" Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk\".\n\nBiden days later called Trump's comments ''dangerous'' and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning October 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than USD 20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued US backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a USD 1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the US semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with US adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around US and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, US officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe USD 61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defence strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.''\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

(AP Photo / Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden signed into law on Wednesday a $95 billion war aid measure that includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and that also has a provision that would force social media site TikTok to be sold or be banned in the U.S.\n\nThe announcement marks an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,\" Biden said at White House event to announce the signing. \"Now we need to move fast, and we are.\"\n\nBut significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid. Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden approved immediately sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance and said the shipment would begin arriving in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.wttw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTTW News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@news.wttw.com",

It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win. But longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine - after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure - can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money. \"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\"\u009d said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\u009d Russia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city. House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war. \"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\"\u009d McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\u009d Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States. Indeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\"\u009d Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\"\u009d to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House. It was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\"\u009d Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\"\u009d and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands. But in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier. Biden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding. At the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone. Far-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing. By late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote. In private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going - an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives. On explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid - a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff. For his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding. At frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\"\u009d according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions. So they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides - seated around a big oval table in Zients' office - would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid. Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus. The White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. - two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson. All the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct. \"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\"\u009d Schumer said. In public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions. For example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran. The $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say. Realistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine - and its allies - include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington. \"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\"\u009d Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\" ___ This story has been corrected to show the signing was Wednesday, not Thursday. ___ Associated

The package provides air defense, artillery, and armored vehicles for Ukraine, where they're experiencing setbacks in the Russian invasion. Despite the new aid, Ukraine faces challenges in recovering and may face further Russian gains in the short term. The bill also includes provisions for TikTok's sale or ban, Israeli aid, Palestinian humanitarian relief, and conditions for European NATO support. Republicans initially delayed the aid but later reversed their stance, with some urging increased support for Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he was immediately rushing badly needed weaponry to Ukraine as he signed into law a USD 95 billion war aid measure that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots.\n\nThe announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine, with Biden promising that US weapons shipment would begin making the way into Ukraine ''in the next few hours''.\n\n''We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,'' Biden said at a White House event to announce the bill signing. ''Now we need to move fast, and we are.'' But significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine. Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine USD 1 billion in military assistance, the first installment from about USD 61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defence capabilities, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed on Wednesday. The US is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorised to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new US aid flows into Ukraine, it is possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n''The fact is that it is going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,'' he said.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about USD 26 billion in aid for Israel and about USD 1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory ''without delay''.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The US is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new U.S. aid flows into Ukraine, it's possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The fact is that it's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,\" he said.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While the former president stopped short of endorsing the funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nMany European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump term would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and NATO. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" But in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' October 7 attack on Israel, used a prime-time address to make his pitch for the funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted weeks earlier at the urging of restive legislators on the right.\n\nFar-right Republicans have adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a monthslong, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. On explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" he said.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with US adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around US and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting to Kyiv additional weaponry that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed,\" Bowman said, \"but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster US border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the US Republicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news",

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military aid package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" But in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime-time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted weeks earlier at the urging of restive legislators on the right.\n\nFar-right Republicans have adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a monthslong, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. On explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" he said.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting to Kyiv additional weaponry that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed,\" Bowman said, \"but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S. Republicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "wbal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nTHE HOUSE: Ukraine, Israel aid advances in rare House vote as Democrats help Republicans push it forward\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine.

Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden approved immediately sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance and said the shipment would begin arriving in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first installment from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new U.S. aid flows into Ukraine, it's possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The fact is that it's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,\" he said.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While the former president stopped short of endorsing the funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nMany European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump term would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com",

This came after the US Senate passed the package after months of delays following a furious debate over US priorities.\n\nThe announcement marks an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,\" Biden said at White House event to announce the signing. \"Now we need to move fast, and we are.\"\n\nBut significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid.

So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern. TikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress. \"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay\".\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk\". Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier. Biden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning October 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued US backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid. Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the US semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing\".\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\" At frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working\", according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid. Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus. The White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-SC, two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner. In public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with US adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defence industrial complex and get around US and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say. Realistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defence strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\" Biden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster US border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the US.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration. \"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"\n\n(AP)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden said the transfer of an initial aid package of military assistance will begin in a matter of hours -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source":

The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden approved immediately sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance and said the shipment would begin arriving in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime-time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far-right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as a direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea, and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics, and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft, and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum, and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The package includes USD 61 billion for Ukraine, USD 26 billion for Israel, and aid for Palestinians in Gaza. Notably, it also includes a provision potentially leading to TikTok's ban in the US. Despite the aid, Ukraine faces ongoing challenges and may need further support. The bill's passage followed a lengthy debate over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine, with some Republicans opposing it. Biden played a key role in securing support for the package, emphasizing the stakes and working behind the scenes with Speaker Johnson and other Republicans. Military experts caution that Ukraine will require ongoing support and may need to recalibrate its goals to secure its long-term defense. The package did not include funding for US border security, a request from Biden that was rejected by Republicans.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law on Wednesday a USD 95 billion war aid measure that includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and that also has a provision that would force social media site TikTok to be sold or be banned in the US.\n\nThe announcement marks an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,'' Biden said at White House event to announce the signing. ''Now we need to move fast, and we are.\" But significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid. Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden approved immediately sending Ukraine USD 1 billion in military assistance and said the shipment would begin arriving in the \"next few hours'' -- the first tranche from about USD 61 billion allocated for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes air defence capabilities, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favour in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\" Tucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe bill also includes about USD 26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about USD 1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay\".\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk\". Biden days later called Trump's comments ''dangerous'' and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning October 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than USD 20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued US backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a USD 1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the US semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing''.\n\n\"History will remember this moment,'' Biden said. ''For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\" At frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working\", according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with US adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defence industrial complex and get around US and European sanctions.\n\nThe USD 61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defence strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.'' Biden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster US border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the US.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier.

Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry.

So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\n'Unconstitutional' TikTok ban\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States.\n\nThe president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAid for Gaza 'without delay'\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nThe political challenge of approving the aid\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far-right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine.\n\nWhile he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance.\n\nThe European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defence spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\"\n\nBiden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House's manoeuvring to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning October 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime-time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier.\n\nMcCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far-right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money to Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight.\n\nBiden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued US backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker.\n\nBiden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia.\n\nFive days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as a direct and honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official.\n\nBiden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the US semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits.\n\nAnd he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Representatives Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with US adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defence industrial complex and get around US and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, US officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry.\n\nEarlier, the White House publicised intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nMore aid required\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defence strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden is expected to quickly approve the transfer of an initial aid package of about $1 billion in military assistance -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nIn a statement after the Senate passed the package Tuesday night, Biden said he would sign it as soon as he receives it on Wednesday.\n\n\"This critical legislation will make our nation and world more secure as we support our friends who are defending themselves against terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin,\" Biden said.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source":

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden is expected to quickly approve the transfer of an initial aid package of about $1 billion in military assistance -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nIn a statement after the Senate passed the package Tuesday night, Biden said he would sign it as soon as he receives it on Wednesday.\n\n\"This critical legislation will make our nation and world more secure as we support our friends who are defending themselves against terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin,\" Biden said.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first installment from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new U.S. aid flows into Ukraine, it's possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The fact is that it's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,\" he said.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While the former president stopped short of endorsing the funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nMany European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump term would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" But in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a prime-time address to make his pitch for the funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted weeks earlier at the urging of restive legislators on the right.", "source": {"uri": "virginislandsdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.Biden said the transfer of an initial aid package of military assistance will begin in a matter of hours -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.But longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"Russia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city, pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.Indeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.It was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.But in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.Biden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.At the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.Far-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.By late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.In private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.On explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.For his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.At frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.So they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.The White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.All the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.In public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.For example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.The $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.Realistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"___Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law into law Wednesday a $95 billion war aid measure that includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that also includes a provision that would force social media site TikTok to be sold or be banned in U.S.\n\nThe announcement marks an end to long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"We rose to the moment. we came together. and we got it done,\" Biden said at White House event to announce the signing. \"Now we need to move fast, and we are,\"\n\nBut significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's brutal invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFLA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nGOP opposition to Ukraine aid\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden to aides: 'Just keep talking'\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first installment from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new U.S. aid flows into Ukraine, it's possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The fact is that it's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,\" he said.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine.

The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe bill also includes about USD 26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about USD 1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay\".\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk\". Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning October 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than USD 20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued US backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a USD 1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the US semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing\".\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working\", according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with US adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defence industrial complex and get around US and European sanctions.\n\nThe USD 61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defence strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster US border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the US.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.metrovaartha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "metrovaartha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden approved immediately sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance and said the shipment would begin arriving in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time.

Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city, pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far-right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime-time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a monthslong, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as a direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\n0

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nAlso Read | Japan: Smoke Seen as ANA Flight Carrying About 200 People Lands Safely in Northern Japan, Public TV Says.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine USD 1 billion in military assistance, the first installment from about USD 61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defence capabilities, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed on Wednesday. The US is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorised to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new US aid flows into Ukraine, it is possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The fact is that it is going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,\" he said.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about USD 26 billion in aid for Israel and about USD 1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory \"without delay\".\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While the former president stopped short of endorsing the funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nMany European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump term would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and NATO. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that do not meet defence spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk\". But in reality, the White House manoeuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' October 7 attack on Israel, used a prime-time address to make his pitch for the funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted weeks earlier at the urging of restive legislators on the right.\n\nFar-right Republicans have adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than USD 20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a monthslong, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia.

Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source":

Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as a direct and honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff was in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker.

And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said shipment would begin in the \"next few hours\" -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBiden is expected to quickly approve the transfer of an initial aid package of about $1 billion in military assistance -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a statement after the Senate passed the package Tuesday night, Biden said he would sign it as soon as he receives it on Wednesday.\n\n\"This critical legislation will make our nation and world more secure as we support our friends who are defending themselves against terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin,\" Biden said.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden said the transfer of an initial aid package of military assistance will begin in a matter of hours -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source":

In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the signing was Wednesday, not

Watch the event in the player above.\n\nThe announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine, with Biden promising that U.S. weapons shipment would begin making the way into Ukraine \"in the next few hours.\"\n\n\"We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,\" Biden said a White House event to announce the bill signing. \"Now we need to move fast, and we are.\"\n\nBut significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine.

The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan cautioned that even as new U.S. aid flows into Ukraine, it's possible that Russia will continue to make tactical gains in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"The fact is that it's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay,\" he said.", "source":

The Senate passed the legislation Tuesday night, and Biden signed it into law Wednesday morning.\n\nThe new funding ended months of political deadlock that saw the bill stall because some Republicans were opposed to arming Ukraine even though Russia gained momentum on the battlefield.\n\n\"When our allies are stronger, we are stronger. This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences,\" Biden said.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in posts on X thanked the House and Senate for passing the foreign aid package.\n\n\"I am also grateful to all Americans who continue to support Ukraine and recognize that the historical significance of this bill extends beyond politics,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement Tuesday. \"Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner.\"\n\nPrevious aid has been provided through presidential drawdown authorities, where equipment is pulled from existing U.S. military stocks and sent to Ukraine on an emergency basis, or long-term assistance to procure weapons and munitions from the defense industry or partner countries for a later time.\n\nWith the latest package, the U.S. has provided nearly $46 billion in aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022 that has stretched into its third year.\n\n* Small arms and additional rounds of small arms ammunition, including .50 caliber rounds to counter drones.\n\n* Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket

Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nTwo

The package also includes a bill that could eventually lead to the banning of TikTok in the United States - giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else it will be banned from app stores in the United States.\n\nWearing a US-Ukrainian flag pin and speaking from the White House after signing the bill on Wednesday, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\"\n\nThe aid package, Biden said, is \"going to make America safer. It's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world.\"\n\nThe signing of the aid package was the culmination of months of tense negotiations, personal lobbying from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a split in the House Republican conference that continues to threaten the leadership position of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline House conservatives opposed further US funding to Kyiv and threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of the negotiations. Conservatives in Congress have opposed additional assistance for what they view as an unwinnable war.\n\nBiden had spent months lobbying Johnson to move forward with aid to Ukraine, enlisting top administration officials and CIA Director Bill Burns to lay out the stakes for Ukraine - and ultimately democracy in Europe and across the world - if Russia continued to make inroads in its military campaign there.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signaled his intentions to make significant immigration-related concessions if Congress were to move forward with the aid bill. Republicans in Congress had demanded those concessions, but retreated from the issue after former President Donald Trump signaled his opposition to allowing Biden to claim a win on an issue Trump hopes to campaign on.\n\nHe acknowledged the bumpy road to get the package passed in his remarks on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was a difficult path,\" Biden said. \"It should have been easier. It should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, came together. We got it done.\"\n\nSpending the bulk of his remarks talking about the Ukraine aid, Biden noted that Russia has \"been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"They've killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians,\" Biden said, \"bombed hospitals ... kindergartens, grain silos, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold dark winter.\"\n\nBut left unsaid in that statement is something that is likely to cause further frustrations from Biden's left flank: Israel has also been accused of targeting hospitals in Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war and carrying out an imprecise military campaign that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, many of them children. The aid package includes billions of dollars worth of additional military equipment for that country.\n\nSome of the Democrats who voted against the bill cited the Israel aid as the reason why they did so.\n\nThe final vote in the Senate was 79-18. Fifteen Republicans voted with two Democrats and an independent against the bill. Among the senators who voted against the bill was Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spent time with Biden earlier this week and said he was against further US funding of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Sanders said in a post on X shortly after the bill's passage. \"No more money for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's war machine.\"\n\nFunding going to Ukraine quickly\n\nThe bill's effects will be felt most quickly and acutely on battlefields in Ukraine, whose soldiers have faced ammunition shortages and battlefield losses in the absence of US assistance this year.\n\nBiden said the shipments of military supplies to Ukraine will begin \"in the next few hours,\" and would include air-defense equipment and munitions for artillery and rocket systems, along with armored vehicles.\n\nThe Pentagon announced a $1 billion aid package would go to Ukraine just moments after Biden signed the bill into law.\n\nAmong the capabilities included in the new package is ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), artillery rounds, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and more. It also includes various logistics and tactical vehicles, anti-armor systems, training munitions and spare parts, and small arms ammunition including .50 caliber rounds to counter drones.\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that administration officials have indicated to Congress the US would send long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, a system Ukraine has long asked for. The Pentagon revealed it already sent those long-range missiles earlier this month after Biden spoke.\n\nBiden secretly approved the transfer of the long-range missiles in February for use inside Ukrainian territory. The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the $300 million aid package announced on March 12 and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn.\n\n\"It was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine's military.\n\nLast fall, the US first sent Ukraine the mid-range variant of the ATACMS missile system, which can reach about 100 miles, while the longer-range version can reach as far as 190 miles.\n\nUkrainian officials have been asking the US in private and in public for the long-range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Moscow if they are deployed.\n\nBiden's campaign will continue to use TikTok\n\nBiden's campaign will still utilize TikTok to reach voters, officials say, despite Biden signing the potential ban into law.\n\nThe decision underscores the fraught dynamic of the platform, which is owned by a Chinese company. While national security officials, including those in the Biden administration, have warned of its risks, it remains enormously popular with young Americans, who Biden will rely upon to win reelection.\n\nAsked Wednesday whether the campaign would continue using the app, an official said it would.\n\n\"A fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are - and that includes online,\" the official said. \"TikTok is one of many places we're making sure our content is being seen by voters. When the stakes are this high in the election, we are going to use every tool we have to reach young voters where they are. We are using enhanced security measures.\"\n\nBiden joined Tiktok earlier this year, and often posts video meant to contrast his policies with Trump, who is not on the platform.\n\nThe bill Biden signed Wednesday gives TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from \"internet hosting services\" that support it.\n\nThat would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden's decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company's made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban.\n\nCNN's Haley Britzky, Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The package also includes a bill that could eventually lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States -- giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else be banned from app stores in the United States.\n\nWearing a US-Ukraine flag pin and speaking from the White House after signing the bill Wednesday, Biden said it was a good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\n\nThe aid package, Biden said, will make America safer. It will make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world.\n\nThe signing of the aid package was the culmination of months of tense negotiations, personal lobbying by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a split in the House Republican caucus that continues to threaten House Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership position. House hardliners opposed further US funding to Kiev and threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of the negotiations. Conservatives in Congress have opposed additional aid for what they see as an unwinnable war.\n\nBiden had spent months lobbying Johnson to move forward with aid to Ukraine, asking senior administration officials and CIA Director Bill Burns to lay out the stakes for Ukraine -- and ultimately democracy in Europe and around the world. - if Russia continues to make inroads into its military. campaign there.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signaled his intentions to make significant concessions on immigration if Congress moves forward with the aid bill. Republicans in Congress had sought those concessions but backed away from the issue after former President Donald Trump signaled his opposition to allowing Biden to claim a victory on an issue Trump hopes to campaign on.\n\nHe acknowledged the bumpy road to getting through the pack in his remarks on Wednesday.\n\nIt was a tough road, Biden said. It should have been easier. Should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, we came together. We are done.\n\nSpending much of his remarks talking about aid to Ukraine, Biden noted that Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine.\n\nThey have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians, Biden said, bombed hospitals, gardens, grain silos, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold, dark winter.\n\nBut left unsaid in that statement is something likely to cause further frustration from the Bidens' left: Israel has also been accused of targeting hospitals in Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war and waging a campaign military inaccuracy that has killed dozens of people. thousands of Palestinians, many of them children. The aid package includes billions of dollars in additional military equipment for that country.\n\nSome of the Democrats who voted against the bill cited aid to Israel as the reason they did so.\n\nThe final vote in the Senate was 79-18. Fifteen Republicans voted against the bill with two Democrats and one independent. Among the senators who voted against the bill was Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spent time with Biden earlier this week and said he opposed further US funding of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nEnough is enough, Sanders said in a post on X shortly after the bills passed. There is no more money for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's war machine.\n\nThe effects of the bills will be felt most quickly and acutely on the battlefields of Ukraine, whose soldiers have faced ammunition shortages and battlefield losses in the absence of U.S. aid this year.\n\nBiden said shipments of military supplies to Ukraine would begin in the coming hours and would include air defense equipment and ammunition for artillery and missile systems, along with armored vehicles.\n\nThe Pentagon announced that a $1 billion aid package would go to Ukraine just moments after Biden signed the bill.\n\nAmong the capabilities included in the new package are munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Missile Systems (HIMARS), artillery shells, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and more. It also includes various logistical and tactical vehicles, anti-armor systems, training munitions and spare parts, as well as small arms ammunition, including 50-caliber rounds to combat drones.\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that administration officials have told Congress that the U.S. would send the Army's Long-Range Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, a system that Ukraine has long requested. The Pentagon revealed it had already sent those long-range missiles earlier this month after Biden spoke.\n\nBiden secretly approved the transfer of the long-range missile in February for use inside Ukrainian territory. The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the $300 million aid package announced on March 12 and were finally delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn.\n\nIt was not announced that we were providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request, Garn said, deferring to questions about their use for the Ukrainian military.\n\nLast fall, the U.S. first sent the short-range variant of the ATACMS missile system to Ukraine, which can reach about 100 miles, while the longer-range version can reach up to 190 miles.\n\nUkrainian officials have privately and publicly asked the US to target long-range missiles deeper behind Russian lines. US officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Moscow if they are deployed.\n\nBiden's campaign will still use TikTok to reach voters, officials say, despite Biden signing the potential ban into law.\n\nThe decision underscores the tense dynamics of the platform, which is owned by a Chinese company. While national security officials, including those in the Biden administration, have warned of its dangers, it remains hugely popular with young Americans, on whom Biden will rely to win re-election.\n\nAsked Wednesday if the campaign would continue to use the app, an official said it would.\n\nA fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are, and that includes online, the official said. TikTok is one of the many places where we made sure our content was seen by voters. When the stakes are so high in an election, we'll use every tool at our disposal to reach young voters where they are. We are using enhanced security measures.\n\nBiden joined Tiktok earlier this year, and often posts videos aimed at comparing his policies to Trump, who is not on the platform.\n\nThe bill signed by Biden on Wednesday gives TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be banned from US app stores and from web hosting services that support it.\n\nThis would effectively limit new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden's decision to sign the bill Wednesday sets the deadline for the sale at Jan. 19, 2025. However, under the legislation, Biden can extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the companies have made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Haley Britzky, Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William J.

While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said a defense strategy and policy analyst, Bradley Bowman, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Mr. Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results.

Biden accused China, Iran, North Korea of aiding Russia. Blinken announced new package. Biden warned of potential Russian attack on NATO ally.Washington, The US has secretly delivered long-range ballistic missiles to Ukraine to be used against Russian forces, the Pentagon has confirmed, while President Joe Biden alleged that China, Iran and North Korea were supplying weapons and technology to Moscow to boost its military. President Biden secretly approved the transfer of the long-range ATACMS missiles in February for use inside Ukrainian territory. The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the USD 300 million aid package announced on March 12 and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn said on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine's military.\n\nThe US previously supplied Ukraine with a mid-range version of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) but had been reluctant to send anything more powerful, partly over concerns about compromising US military readiness.\n\nThe ballistic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometres, nearly doubling the striking distance of Ukraine's missiles.\n\nPresident Biden directed his team to take this step following Russia's procurement and use of North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine, according to US media outlets.\n\nUkrainian officials have been urging the US for the long-range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Russia if they are deployed.\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Wednesday after signing into law a USD 61 billion aid package providing crucial military assistance to Ukraine, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\"\n\nOver two years, Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's friends keeping him well supplied. Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden on Wednesday signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said on the aid package which was passed by Congress after months of negotiations and debate.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken also announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine.\n\n\"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally.\n\n\"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview with Fox News, thanked the US for sending much-needed military aid amounting to USD 61 billion.\n\n\"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America.... And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The package also includes a bill that could eventually lead to the banning of TikTok in the United States - giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else it will be banned from app stores in the United States.\n\nWearing a US-Ukrainian flag pin and speaking from the White House after signing the bill on Wednesday, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\"\n\nThe aid package, Biden said, is \"going to make America safer. It's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world.\"\n\nThe signing of the aid package was the culmination of months of tense negotiations, personal lobbying from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a split in the House Republican conference that continues to threaten the leadership position of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline House conservatives opposed further US funding to Kyiv and threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of the negotiations. Conservatives in Congress have opposed additional assistance for what they view as an unwinnable war.\n\nBiden had spent months lobbying Johnson to move forward with aid to Ukraine, enlisting top administration officials and CIA Director Bill Burns to lay out the stakes for Ukraine - and ultimately democracy in Europe and across the world - if Russia continued to make inroads in its military campaign there.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signaled his intentions to make significant immigration-related concessions if Congress were to move forward with the aid bill. Republicans in Congress had demanded those concessions, but retreated from the issue after former President Donald Trump signaled his opposition to allowing Biden to claim a win on an issue Trump hopes to campaign on.\n\nHe acknowledged the bumpy road to get the package passed in his remarks on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was a difficult path,\" Biden said. \"It should have been easier. It should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, came together. We got it done.\"\n\nSpending the bulk of his remarks talking about the Ukraine aid, Biden noted that Russia has \"been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"They've killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians,\" Biden said, \"bombed hospitals ... kindergartens, grain silos, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold dark winter.\"\n\nBut left unsaid in that statement is something that is likely to cause further frustrations from Biden's left flank: Israel has also been accused of targeting hospitals in Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war and carrying out an imprecise military campaign that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, many of them children. The aid package includes billions of dollars worth of additional military equipment for that country.\n\nSome of the Democrats who voted against the bill cited the Israel aid as the reason why they did so.\n\nThe final vote in the Senate was 79-18. Fifteen Republicans voted with two Democrats and an independent against the bill. Among the senators who voted against the bill was Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spent time with Biden earlier this week and said he was against further US funding of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Sanders said in a post on X shortly after the bill's passage. \"No more money for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's war machine.\"\n\nFunding going to Ukraine quickly\n\nThe bill's effects will be felt most quickly and acutely on battlefields in Ukraine, whose soldiers have faced ammunition shortages and battlefield losses in the absence of US assistance this year.\n\nBiden said the shipments of military supplies to Ukraine will begin \"in the next few hours,\" and would include air-defense equipment and munitions for artillery and rocket systems, along with armored vehicles.\n\nThe Pentagon announced a $1 billion aid package would go to Ukraine just moments after Biden signed the bill into law.\n\nAmong the capabilities included in the new package is ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), artillery rounds, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and more. It also includes various logistics and tactical vehicles, anti-armor systems, training munitions and spare parts, and small arms ammunition including .50 caliber rounds to counter drones.\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that administration officials have indicated to Congress the US would send long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, a system Ukraine has long asked for. The ATACMS were not included in the Pentagon's official list of equipment being sent to Ukraine, though that's not entirely unusual; last year, when the US provided a particular variant of the ATACMS, the administration did so quietly.\n\nAn official told CNN at the time that the intent in keeping it quiet was to surprise Russia, lest they moved weapons out of range of the missiles before Ukraine could use them.\n\nLast fall the US first sent Ukraine the midrange variant of the ATACMS missile system, which can reach about 100 miles, while the longer-range version can reach as far as 190 miles. Ukrainian officials have been asking the US both in private and in public for the long-range missile to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have resisted, citing both supplies and further provoking Moscow as excuses.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday ATACMS should be quickly sent to Ukraine.\n\n\"Getting this additional equipment as quickly as possible, I hope once this gets to the president by Tuesday or Wednesday, that these shipments will be literally launched with that longer range ATACMS,\" he said.\n\nBiden's campaign will continue to use TikTok\n\nBiden's campaign will still utilize TikTok to reach voters, officials say, despite Biden signing the potential ban into law.\n\nThe decision underscores the fraught dynamic of the platform, which is owned by a Chinese company. While national security officials, including those in the Biden administration, have warned of its risks, it remains enormously popular with young Americans, who Biden will rely upon to win reelection.\n\nAsked Wednesday whether the campaign would continue using the app, an official said it would.\n\n\"A fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are - and that includes online,\" the official said. \"TikTok is one of many places we're making sure our content is being seen by voters. When the stakes are this high in the election, we are going to use every tool we have to reach young voters where they are. We are using enhanced security measures.\"\n\nBiden joined Tiktok earlier this year, and often posts video meant to contrast his policies with Trump, who is not on the platform.\n\nThe bill Biden signed Wednesday gives TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from \"internet hosting services\" that support it.\n\nThat would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden's decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company's made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Haley Britzky contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The National Security supplemental aid provides roughly $26 billion for Israel, $61 billion for Ukraine and $8 billion for U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific -- namely Taiwan.\n\nThe package headed to Ukraine comes after dire warnings by top U.S. military officials in Europe about Ukraine's fastly depleting artillery and other air defense munitions needed to defend itself against Russia.

Pat Ryder said the U.S. would deliver equipment to Ukraine using \"a very robust logistics network\" and \"a variety of means to get capabilities into Ukraine to include from preexisting storage facilities that are located and lots of different places to include Europe.\"\n\n\"This is directly in the United States national security interest. If Putin tries to triumph in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally,\" Biden said. \"We'd have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 attacks.\"\n\nThe package includes billions of dollars worth of air defense for Israel to defend against attacks from Iran, Hezbollah and other proxy groups in the region, Biden said, as well as $1 billion additional for humanitarian aid for Palestinians living in Gaza who are displaced due to the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe package also includes humanitarian aid for other places around the world like Haiti, Sudan, and Somalia.", "source": {"uri": "taskandpurpose.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Task & Purpose"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patty_nieberg@taskandpurpose.com", "name": "Patty Nieberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Defense_Artillery_Branch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air Defense Artillery Branch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_G._Cavoli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher G.

The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the USD 300 million aid package announced on March 12 and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn said on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine's military.\n\nThe US previously supplied Ukraine with a mid-range version of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) but had been reluctant to send anything more powerful, partly over concerns about compromising US military readiness.\n\nThe ballistic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometres, nearly doubling the striking distance of Ukraine's missiles.\n\nPresident Biden directed his team to take this step following Russia's procurement and use of North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine, according to US media outlets.\n\nUkrainian officials have been urging the US for the long-range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Russia if they are deployed.\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Wednesday after signing into law a USD 61 billion aid package providing crucial military assistance to Ukraine, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\" Over two years, Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's friends keeping him well supplied. Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden on Wednesday signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said on the aid package which was passed by Congress after months of negotiations and debate.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken also announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine.\n\n\"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally.\n\n\"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview with Fox News, thanked the US for sending much-needed military aid amounting to USD 61 billion.\n\n\"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America....

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday. The U.S. is providing more of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in the new military aid package, according to one official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.\n\nJohnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nBiden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they \"stepped up and did the right thing.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"History will remember this moment,\" Biden said. \"For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past three years, we've seen it time and again on the critical issues. We've actually come together.\"\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions that it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S.\n\nRepublicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\n\"It should have been included in this bill,\" Biden said. \"I'm determined to get it done for the American people.\"\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI (Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nThe votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "trentonian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trentonian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@trentonian.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armoured fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the USD 300 million aid package announced on March 12 and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn said on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine's military.\n\nThe US previously supplied Ukraine with a mid-range version of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) but had been reluctant to send anything more powerful, partly over concerns about compromising US military readiness.\n\nThe ballistic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometres, nearly doubling the striking distance of Ukraine's missiles.\n\nPresident Biden directed his team to take this step following Russia's procurement and use of North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine, according to US media outlets.\n\nUkrainian officials have been urging the US for the long-range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Russia if they are deployed.\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Wednesday after signing into law a USD 61 billion aid package providing crucial military assistance to Ukraine, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\" Over two years, Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's friends keeping him well supplied. Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden on Wednesday signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said on the aid package which was passed by Congress after months of negotiations and debate.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken also announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine.\n\n\"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally.\n\n\"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview with Fox News, thanked the US for sending much-needed military aid amounting to USD 61 billion.\n\n\"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America.... And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.

The package also includes a bill that could eventually lead to the banning of TikTok in the United States - giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else it will be banned from app stores in the United States.\n\nWearing a US-Ukrainian flag pin and speaking from the White House after signing the bill on Wednesday, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\"\n\nThe aid package, Biden said, is \"going to make America safer. It's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world.\"\n\nThe signing of the aid package was the culmination of months of tense negotiations, personal lobbying from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a split in the House Republican conference that continues to threaten the leadership position of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline House conservatives opposed further US funding to Kyiv and threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of the negotiations. Conservatives in Congress have opposed additional assistance for what they view as an unwinnable war.\n\nBiden had spent months lobbying Johnson to move forward with aid to Ukraine, enlisting top administration officials and CIA Director Bill Burns to lay out the stakes for Ukraine - and ultimately democracy in Europe and across the world - if Russia continued to make inroads in its military campaign there.\n\nEarlier this year, Biden signaled his intentions to make significant immigration-related concessions if Congress were to move forward with the aid bill. Republicans in Congress had demanded those concessions, but retreated from the issue after former President Donald Trump signaled his opposition to allowing Biden to claim a win on an issue Trump hopes to campaign on.\n\nHe acknowledged the bumpy road to get the package passed in his remarks on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was a difficult path,\" Biden said. \"It should have been easier. It should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, came together. We got it done.\"\n\nSpending the bulk of his remarks talking about the Ukraine aid, Biden noted that Russia has \"been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"They've killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians,\" Biden said, \"bombed hospitals ... kindergartens, grain silos, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold dark winter.\"\n\nBut left unsaid in that statement is something that is likely to cause further frustrations from Biden's left flank: Israel has also been accused of targeting hospitals in Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war and carrying out an imprecise military campaign that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, many of them children. The aid package includes billions of dollars worth of additional military equipment for that country.\n\nSome of the Democrats who voted against the bill cited the Israel aid as the reason why they did so.\n\nThe final vote in the Senate was 79-18. Fifteen Republicans voted with two Democrats and an independent against the bill. Among the senators who voted against the bill was Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spent time with Biden earlier this week and said he was against further US funding of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Sanders said in a post on X shortly after the bill's passage. \"No more money for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's war machine.\"\n\nThe bill's effects will be felt most quickly and acutely on battlefields in Ukraine, whose soldiers have faced ammunition shortages and battlefield losses in the absence of US assistance this year.\n\nBiden said the shipments of military supplies to Ukraine will begin \"in the next few hours,\" and would include air-defense equipment and munitions for artillery and rocket systems, along with armored vehicles.\n\nThe Pentagon announced a $1 billion aid package would go to Ukraine just moments after Biden signed the bill into law.\n\nAmong the capabilities included in the new package is ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), artillery rounds, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and more. It also includes various logistics and tactical vehicles, anti-armor systems, training munitions and spare parts, and small arms ammunition including .50 caliber rounds to counter drones.\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that administration officials have indicated to Congress the US would send long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, a system Ukraine has long asked for. The Pentagon revealed it already sent those long-range missiles earlier this month after Biden spoke.\n\nBiden secretly approved the transfer of the long-range missiles in February for use inside Ukrainian territory. The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the $300 million aid package announced on March 12 and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn.\n\n\"It was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine's military.\n\nLast fall, the US first sent Ukraine the mid-range variant of the ATACMS missile system, which can reach about 100 miles, while the longer-range version can reach as far as 190 miles.\n\nUkrainian officials have been asking the US in private and in public for the long-range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Moscow if they are deployed.\n\nBiden's campaign will still utilize TikTok to reach voters, officials say, despite Biden signing the potential ban into law.\n\nThe decision underscores the fraught dynamic of the platform, which is owned by a Chinese company. While national security officials, including those in the Biden administration, have warned of its risks, it remains enormously popular with young Americans, who Biden will rely upon to win reelection.\n\nAsked Wednesday whether the campaign would continue using the app, an official said it would.\n\n\"A fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are - and that includes online,\" the official said. \"TikTok is one of many places we're making sure our content is being seen by voters. When the stakes are this high in the election, we are going to use every tool we have to reach young voters where they are. We are using enhanced security measures.\"\n\nBiden joined Tiktok earlier this year, and often posts video meant to contrast his policies with Trump, who is not on the platform.\n\nThe bill Biden signed Wednesday gives TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from \"internet hosting services\" that support it.\n\nThat would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden's decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company's made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Haley Britzky, Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantavoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta Voice | Atlanta GA News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approval was expected either late Tuesday or today.\n\nThe votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built during the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects President Joe Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nThis photo, provided by head of the Odesa Regional Military Administration Oleh Kiper, firefighters work on the site of a damaged building after a Russian drone attack in Odesa, Ukraine, Tuesday, April 23, 2024.

Biden said the package showed that the United States and its allies fully support Ukraine in its battle against invading Russian forces and that the approval was important to show \"we stand up against Putin,\" a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"In the next few hours we will begin sending air defense munitions, for artillery, for rocket systems, and armored vehicles,\" Biden said. \"I'm making sure the shipments start right away.\"\n\nThe State Department confirmed later on April 24 that the United States sent long-range missile systems known as ATACMS to Ukraine for use inside its territory and the weapons arrived in the country this month. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters that the ATACMS, short for Army Tactical Missile System, were sent at Biden's direction.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Biden for authorizing the desperately needed military aid that had stalled in Congress since late last year.\n\n\"No matter what anyone says, we are getting the support we need to continue to protect lives from Russian attacks,\" Zelenskiy said on X. \"Over the past few days, we have already been actively working with our American friends on all levels to include the exact types of weapons that our warriors require in this package.\"\n\nBiden said that the package was \"literally an investment not only in Ukrainian security but in Europe's security, in our own security.\" He said that if Congress had not stepped up and passed the aid to Ukraine, it would have sent the wrong signal to NATO, which he said the United States has worked to unify, strengthen, and expand since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"Imagine instead if we had failed...to step up now and to support Ukraine. All those gains would have begun to unravel. The cohesion of NATO would have been weakened. And our national security would have been undermined without any question,\" the president said.\n\nBiden spoke from the White House after the U.S. Senate easily approved a package of bills late on April 23. The legislation had stalled in the House of Representatives for months, but House Republican leaders decided last week to bring the measures up for a vote, and they passed on April 20, sending it to the Senate.\n\nThe bills provide $61 billion for Ukraine, $26 billion for Israel, and $8.12 billion \"to counter communist China\" in the Indo-Pacific. The fourth bill includes a potential ban on the social media app TikTok, measures for the transfer of seized Russian assets to Ukraine, and new sanctions on Iran.\n\nDuring debate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat-New York) had urged his Senate colleagues to pass the legislation as Kyiv struggles to hold its territory amid a shortage of weapons and ammunition caused in large part by the delay in U.S. aid.\n\n\"This is an is an inflection point in history. Western democracy perhaps faced its greatest threat since the end of the Cold War,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer told a news conference after the aid to Ukraine passed that it was \"one of the most important measures Congress has passed in a very long time to protect American security and the security of Western democracy.\"\n\nMany of the no votes against the bill came from Republicans, most of whom are allied with former President Donald Trump. The Republicans said they oppose the bill in part because it doesn't include any U.S. security matters, particularly to strengthen the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nZelenskiy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he was grateful to the United States Senate for approving the aid.\n\n\"I equally appreciate President Biden's support and look forward to the bill being signed soon and the next military aid package matching the resoluteness that I always see in our negotiations. Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery, and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner,\" he added.\n\nIn the face of an expected wave of weaponry from U.S. and Ukraine's other allies, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces would expand their aerial bombardment of Ukraine to include storage bases that house Western-supplied weapons.\n\nAn intense Russian missile and drone strikes campaign on Ukrainian cities has taken a large toll in human lives and has caused huge damage to the country's already battered energy infrastructure after more than two years of war.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-140_ATACMS",

The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the USD 300 million aid package announced on March 12 and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn said on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read | Karachi Shocker: District Judge's Son Shot Dead by Friend for Eating Half of His Girlfriend's Burger in Pakistan, Accused Arrested.\n\n\"It was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine's military.\n\nThe US previously supplied Ukraine with a mid-range version of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) but had been reluctant to send anything more powerful, partly over concerns about compromising US military readiness.\n\nAlso Read | 'Deeply Biased': India Reacts to US Report Alleging Human Rights Violations, Says It Reflects 'Poor Understanding' of Country (Watch Video).\n\nThe ballistic missiles have a range of up to 300 kilometres, nearly doubling the striking distance of Ukraine's missiles.\n\nPresident Biden directed his team to take this step following Russia's procurement and use of North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine, according to US media outlets.\n\nUkrainian officials have been urging the US for the long-range missiles to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have previously resisted, citing supply issues and concerns about further provoking Russia if they are deployed.\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Wednesday after signing into law a USD 61 billion aid package providing crucial military assistance to Ukraine, Biden said it was a \"good day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\"\n\nOver two years, Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's friends keeping him well supplied. Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden on Wednesday signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said on the aid package which was passed by Congress after months of negotiations and debate.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken also announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine.\n\n\"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally.\n\n\"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview with Fox News, thanked the US for sending much-needed military aid amounting to USD 61 billion.\n\n\"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America.... And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"We rose to the moment. we came together. and we got it done,\" Biden said at White House event to announce the signing. \"Now we need to move fast, and we are,\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut significant damage has been done to the Biden administration's effort to help Ukraine repel Russia's brutal invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid. Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden said the transfer of an initial aid package of military assistance will begin in a matter of hours -- the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to U.S. officials. It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the signing was Wednesday, not Thursday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nBiden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first installment from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine. The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nStill, longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine, after months of losses and massive damage to its infrastructure, can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe bill includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the bill reaches the Hamas-controlled territory \"without delay.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delayed the aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While the former president stopped short of endorsing the funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nMany European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump term would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting to Kyiv additional weaponry that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed,\" Bowman said, \"but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security. The White House had proposed including in the package provisions it said would have helped stem the tide of migrants and asylum seekers coming to the U.S. Republicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that's been an albatross for the Democratic administration.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Lolita C.

The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approval was expected either Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nThe votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects President Joe Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nAlso Read | Japan: Smoke Seen as ANA Flight Carrying About 200 People Lands Safely in Northern Japan, Public TV Says.\n\nBiden said the transfer of an initial aid package of military assistance will begin in a matter of hours -- the first tranche from about USD 61 billion allocated for Ukraine, according to US officials.\n\nIt is expected to include air defence capabilities, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favour in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city, pummelling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.

Biden said he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.\n\nThe initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\n\nBiden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion for more than two years.\n\nTrump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.\n\nBiden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.\n\n\"This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences,\" he said.\n\nBiden blamed \"MAGA Republicans\" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nHe said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.\n\n\"He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin,\" he said.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe social media platform is particularly popular with left-leaning young Americans, a group crucial to Biden's victory in November.\n\nCongress's stalemate on the Ukraine aid bill ended when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives abruptly changed course and approved four bills that included funding for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other US partners in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday.\n\nBiden and House Speaker Johnson held intense talks about Ukraine in February and the president has both pleaded with Republicans to back the package and scolded them for not doing so. Johnson, who faces calls by some right-leaning Republicans to oust him for his turnaround on aid, met with Trump in Florida earlier this month; the former president said Johnson was \"doing a really good job.\"\n\nThe US Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, passing a sweeping bill that provides $61 billion in aid to the country, which has suffered setbacks in the war that supporters blame on the delay in getting the additional US funding.\n\nHeather Conley, an expert on European affairs, said the victory for US allies and for Biden was tempered by effects that the delay has had for Kiev on the battlefield.\n\n\"This is a strong message of American leadership at a time of enormous instability, but the delay created cracks in that credibility,\" said Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nBiden has argued that he helped restore US credibility on the world stage after Trump's tumultuous four-year tenure, in part by strengthening the NATO alliance and providing a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump has argued for an \"America First\" policy and has threatened to let NATO allies fend for themselves if they do not increase their defence spending.\n\nRepublicans who backed the aid package said it was not a vote for Biden but a reflection of their party's values.\n\n\"Peace through strength. That's our tradition,\" Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said in a Senate speech. \"To my Republican colleagues and friends in the Senate, our tradition is much more serious. It's prouder. And I will tell you this: It's much more supported by the American people. Peace through strength, not American retreat.\"", "source": {"uri": "gdnonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf Daily News Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate began debate on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approval was expected either Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nThe votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects President Joe Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aamer_madhani@eagletribune.com", "name": "Aamer Madhani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lolita_c_baldor@eagletribune.com", "name": "Lolita C.

Biden said the package showed that the United States and its allies fully support Ukraine in its battle against invading Russian forces and that the approval was important to show \"we stand up against Putin,\" a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"In the next few hours we will begin sending air defense munitions, for artillery, for rocket systems, and armored vehicles,\" Biden said. \"I'm making sure the shipments start right away.\"\n\nThe State Department confirmed later on April 24 that the United States sent long-range missile systems known as ATACMS to Ukraine for use inside its territory and the weapons arrived in the country this month. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters that the ATACMS, short for Army Tactical Missile System, were sent at Biden's direction.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Biden for authorizing the desperately needed military aid that had stalled in Congress since late last year.\n\n\"No matter what anyone says, we are getting the support we need to continue to protect lives from Russian attacks,\" Zelenskiy said on X. \"Over the past few days, we have already been actively working with our American friends on all levels to include the exact types of weapons that our warriors require in this package.\"\n\nBiden said that the package was \"literally an investment not only in Ukrainian security but in Europe's security, in our own security.\" He said that if Congress had not stepped up and passed the aid to Ukraine, it would have sent the wrong signal to NATO, which he said the United States has worked to unify, strengthen, and expand since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"Imagine instead if we had failed...to step up now and to support Ukraine. All those gains would have begun to unravel. The cohesion of NATO would have been weakened. And our national security would have been undermined without any question,\" the president said.\n\nBiden spoke from the White House after the U.S. Senate easily approved a package of bills late on April 23. The legislation had stalled in the House of Representatives for months, but House Republican leaders decided last week to bring the measures up for a vote, and they passed on April 20, sending it to the Senate.\n\nThe bills provide $61 billion for Ukraine, $26 billion for Israel, and $8.12 billion \"to counter communist China\" in the Indo-Pacific. The fourth bill includes a potential ban on the social media app TikTok, measures for the transfer of seized Russian assets to Ukraine, and new sanctions on Iran.\n\nDuring debate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat-New York) had urged his Senate colleagues to pass the legislation as Kyiv struggles to hold its territory amid a shortage of weapons and ammunition caused in large part by the delay in U.S. aid.\n\n\"This is an is an inflection point in history. Western democracy perhaps faced its greatest threat since the end of the Cold War,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer told a news conference after the aid to Ukraine passed that it was \"one of the most important measures Congress has passed in a very long time to protect American security and the security of Western democracy.\"\n\nMany of the no votes against the bill came from Republicans, most of whom are allied with former President Donald Trump. The Republicans said they oppose the bill in part because it doesn't include any U.S. security matters, particularly to strengthen the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nZelenskiy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he was grateful to the United States Senate for approving the aid.\n\n\"I equally appreciate President Biden's support and look forward to the bill being signed soon and the next military aid package matching the resoluteness that I always see in our negotiations. Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery, and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner,\" he added.\n\nIn the face of an expected wave of weaponry from U.S. and Ukraine's other allies, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces would expand their aerial bombardment of Ukraine to include storage bases that house Western-supplied weapons.\n\nAn intense Russian missile and drone strikes campaign on Ukrainian cities has taken a large toll in human lives and has caused huge damage to the country's already battered energy infrastructure after more than two years of war.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/biden-signs-ukraine- military-aid-bill-shipments-start/32919148.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2024.

Biden said he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.\n\nThe initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\n\nBiden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion for more than two years. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.\n\nBiden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.\n\n\"This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences,\" he said.\n\nBiden blamed \"MAGA Republicans\" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nHe said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.\n\n\"He's failed again,\" Biden said. \"America stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short-video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe social media platform is particularly popular with left-leaning young Americans, a group crucial to Biden's victory in November.\n\nCongress's stalemate on the Ukraine aid bill ended when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives abruptly changed course and approved four bills that included funding for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other U.S. partners in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday.\n\nBiden and Johnson held intense talks about Ukraine in February, and the president has both pleaded with Republicans to back the package and scolded them for not doing so. Johnson, who faces calls by some right-leaning Republicans to oust him for his turnaround on aid, met with Trump in Florida earlier this month; the former president said Johnson was \"doing a really good job.\"\n\nThe U.S. Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, passing a sweeping bill that provides $61 billion in aid to the country, which has suffered setbacks in the war that supporters blame on the delay in getting the additional U.S. funding.\n\nHeather Conley, an expert on European affairs, said the victory for U.S. allies and for Biden was tempered by effects that the delay has had for Kyiv on the battlefield.\n\n\"This is a strong message of American leadership at a time of enormous instability, but the delay created cracks in that credibility,\" said Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nBiden has argued that he helped restore U.S. credibility on the world stage after Trump's tumultuous four-year tenure, in part by strengthening the NATO alliance and providing a united front against Putin.\n\nTrump has argued for an \"America First\" policy and has threatened to let NATO allies fend for themselves if they do not increase their defense spending.\n\nRepublicans who backed the aid package said it was not a vote for Biden but a reflection of their party's values.\n\n\"Peace through strength. That's our tradition,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said in a Senate speech. \"To my Republican colleagues and friends in the Senate, our tradition is much more serious. It's prouder. And I will tell you this: It's much more supported by the American people. Peace through strength, not American retreat.\"", "source": {"uri": "asia.nikkei.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nikkei Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nLove 0

In divided government, the only way to ever get things done is bipartisanship,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said on April 23, before thanking House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, for moving the legislation along.\n\nThe new legislation means that U.S. military supplies could be moved to Ukraine in a matter of days.\n\nIn early April 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid out the stakes for the U.S. support saying, \"If the Congress doesn't help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war.\" Russia had increased its bombing of Ukraine in recent months, and the battle lines between Russia and Ukraine have moved little in the past year.\n\nPressure increased on lawmakers to pass the aid package after Iran's drone missile attack on Israel on April 14, 2024.\n\nThe U.S. has been the largest single donor backing Ukraine since Russian troops invaded the country in February 2022. Since then, the U.S. has sent Ukraine approximately $113 billion in a combination of cash, military supplies and machinery, as well as food and other humanitarian supplies.\n\nAs a scholar of Eastern Europe, I think there are a few important reasons why the U.S. has a lot at stake in supporting Ukraine.\n\nRepublicans divided over Ukraine aid\n\nSince February 2024, Johnson had delayed initiating a vote on the Ukraine foreign aid bill in the House of Representatives for a few reasons. One major factor was fighting between Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the House.\n\nWhile some centrist Republican politicians supported Ukraine funding and pushed for a vote on the foreign aid package, others - hard-right Republicans - wanted a bill that prioritized what they said are American interests, meaning more of a focus on domestic U.S. problems.\n\nAnother issue was a threat of other Republicans trying to remove Johnson from his leadership role.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky called on Johnson to resign and joined Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a Republican who filed a motion on March 22, 2024, to prompt a vote that could push Johnson out of his House leadership position.\n\nEventually, Johnson reportedly settled on the idea that supporting the legislation was the right decision - and reached out to Democrats across the aisle to help him see the bills through.\n\nDelays on Ukraine benefit Putin\n\nAs the House was stalling on a vote, Ukraine was rationing ammunition and supplies. This, in turn, provided an opportunity for Russia to strengthen its arsenal.\n\nDelays with foreign aid to Ukraine give Putin time to move forward with plans to purchase ballistic missiles from Iran. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby expressed concerns in early January 2024 that Russia was close to acquiring short-range ballistic weapons from Iran.\n\nRussia already buys drones from Iran and ballistic missiles from North Korea.\n\nIn February, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan pointed out that Ukrainian forces lost a major center of resistance in the east of Ukraine called Avdiivka to Russia because of a shortage of ammunition.\n\nWithout foreign aid from the U.S., Ukraine faces a strategic disadvantage that could lead to Russia winning the war. That could lead to Russia increasing its threats on nearby NATO countries.\n\nRussian and Chinese leaders declared a military and political partnership days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They announced on April 9, 2024, that they want to find ways to strengthen their joint security work across Asia and Europe.\n\nU.S. political and military leaders have noted that supporting Ukraine and pushing back against Russia is one clear way to deter China from strengthening its global political power and military reach.\n\nNavy Adm. Samuel J. Paparo said in February 2024 that Russia's potential loss in Ukraine is \"a deterrence in the western Pacific and directly reassures partners.\"\n\nThe admiral said that China is studying the Ukraine invasion for its own purposes, in order to \"effect a short, sharp conflict that presents a fait accompli to all of the world.\" He called for the U.S. to continue to fund Ukraine's war.\n\nThe U.S. needs its long-standing allies in Europe to help push back against China - and deterrence is only as effective as the size of the force doing the deterring.\n\nEly Ratner, the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, recently explained this principle and how it relates to China: \"We believe deterrence is real and deterrence is strong, and we're working every day to keep it that way.\"\n\nForeign aid benefits US arms industry\n\nMost of America's military aid to Ukraine consists of arms and ammunition from existing U.S. stockpiles. More than one-third of the $61 billion spending includes $23 billion dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition systems for the U.S. military.\n\nIn December 2023, Biden signed a U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record-high $886 billion in spending from July 2023 through June 2024. This includes a 5.2% pay raise for troops, $11.5 billion in support of initiatives to help deter China and $800 million to support Ukraine's counteroffensive war.\n\nBut it also allows for the purchasing of new ships, aircraft and other types of ammunition. For defense stocks, that means a promising start to 2024, as the military will be likely to boost defense contractors' revenues looking to restock supplies shipped to Ukraine.\n\nEven though politicians do not always follow public opinion, there are clear reasons why it is in the U.S.'s best interests to keep funding Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The 79-18 vote provided Biden another legislative accomplishment to point to, even in the face of an obstructionist House.\n\nThe Pentagon said Wednesday it would rush the first $1 billion in aid to Ukraine, including shoulder-fired Stinger surface-to-air missiles and other air defense munitions, 155 mm shells, Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, cluster munitions and battlefield vehicles.\n\nBut even as he hailed the package Wednesday, Biden said the process should have \"been easier, and should have gotten there sooner.\"\n\n\"It was a difficult path,\" he added, saying that those on the ground in Ukraine had cheered the news. \"But in the end we did what America always does. We rose to the moment.\"\n\nThe measure comes as Biden faces backlash in the United States over his support for Israel in the war in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government's campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and created a hunger crisis there.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel,\" Biden said, \"is ironclad.\"\n\nBiden's critics on the left are angry about his willingness to provide more weapons to Israel, though the legislation also includes $1 billion for humanitarian aid that the president said will be rushed to Gaza.\n\n\"Israel must make sure this aid reaches all of the Palestinians in Gaza, without delay,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president's signature capped a long road for the White House, one of careful political maneuvering with a new House speaker who faced vehement opposition from the far right of the Republican Party over helping Ukraine.\n\n\"Imagine if instead we had failed,\" Biden said as he admonished \"MAGA Republicans\" for allowing Ukrainian officials to run low on artillery.\n\nThe White House first sent a request for the security package in October, but Republicans -- many of them egged on by former President Donald Trump -- said the United States was bearing too much of the burden. Trump, who has long expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia, has made clear that he would not back Ukraine if he wins in November.\n\nUS officials have bluntly acknowledged that the six-month delay put Ukraine at a disadvantage in its fight against Russia.\n\n\"The Russians have slowly but successfully taken more ground from the Ukrainians and pushed them back against their first, second and, in some places, their third line of defense,\" John Kirby, a spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council, said on Tuesday on Air Force One. \"The short answer is: Yes, there absolutely has been damage in the last several months.\"\n\nThe White House strategy in recent months involved impressing upon members of Congress - and the American people -- that Ukraine could lose the war without the desperately needed aid.\n\nBiden instructed his top aides to avoid publicly criticizing Speaker Mike Johnson but instead to provide him with regular security briefings on the risks of not sending aid, according to senior administration officials. The officials asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nJake Sullivan, the national security adviser, assured Johnson in one call that the United States would be sure to track all of the aid after the speaker called for more accountability over the security assistance.\n\nBiden's chief of staff, Jeff Zients, held daily strategy sessions with the president's top aides, including Sullivan; Steve Ricchetti, a senior counselor; and Shuwanza Goff, the director of legislative affairs.\n\nLast month, as the aid remained stuck in gridlock, Sullivan made a secret mission to Kyiv, Ukraine, keeping the issue in the headlines.\n\nJohnson has said that the security briefings, led by CIA director William Burns, were a crucial factor to winning over his support.\n\nThe aid is broken up into four pieces: a measure for each of the three US allies and another meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that includes a provision that could result in a nationwide ban on TikTok.\n\nThe bill includes $60.8 billion for Ukraine; $26.4 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It also includes sanctions against Iranian and Russian officials.\n\nThe House also added a provision that would require the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion. The idea to include some of the aid for Ukraine in the form of a loan was another example of the influence Trump has over Congress.\n\nTrump has called to make any future aid to Ukraine a loan.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_guided_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank guided missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Dining_Room_of_the_White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State Dining Room of the White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIM-92 Stinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FGM-148 Javelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cluster munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The Israeli government's campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and created a hunger crisis there.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel,\" Biden said, \"is ironclad.\"\n\nBiden's critics on the left are angry about his willingness to provide more weapons to Israel, though the legislation also includes $1 billion for humanitarian aid that the president said would be sent quickly to Gaza.\n\n\"Israel must make sure this aid reaches all of the Palestinians in Gaza, without delay,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president's signature capped a long road for the White House, one of careful political maneuvering with a new House speaker who faced vehement opposition from the far right of the Republican Party over helping Ukraine.\n\n\"Imagine if instead we had failed,\" Biden said as he admonished \"MAGA Republicans\" for allowing Ukrainian officials to run low on artillery.\n\n\"It's a good day for world peace,\" he said.\n\nThe White House first sent a request for the security package in October, but Republicans -- many of them egged on by former president Donald Trump -- said the United States was bearing too much of the burden. Trump, who has long expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia, has made clear that he would not back Ukraine if he wins in November.\n\nUS officials have acknowledged that the six-month delay put Ukraine at a disadvantage in its fight against Russia.\n\n\"The Russians have slowly but successfully taken more ground from the Ukrainians and pushed them back against their first, second and, in some places, their third line of defense,\" John Kirby, a spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council, said on Tuesday on Air Force One. \"The short answer is: Yes, there absolutely has been damage in the last several months.\"\n\nThe White House strategy in recent months involved impressing upon members of Congress -- and the American people -- that Ukraine could lose the war without the desperately needed aid.\n\nBiden instructed his top aides to avoid publicly criticizing Speaker Mike Johnson but instead to provide him with regular security briefings on the risks of not sending aid, according to senior administration officials. The officials asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nJake Sullivan, the national security adviser, assured Johnson in one call in October that the United States would track all of the aid after the speaker called for more accountability over the security assistance.\n\nBiden's aides even went as far as to ask President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and retired US generals to call Johnson directly to make their case.\n\nStill, for months Johnson and right-wing Republicans refused to consider aid to Ukraine unless Biden agreed to measures that would crack down on immigration at the southern border of the United States.\n\nOfficials in the White House grew hopeful when Senate Democrats agreed to legislation that would pair border security with the Ukraine aid in February. But Republicans took a cue from Trump, who wanted to deny Biden an election year victory, and rejected the proposal.\n\nLast month, as the aid remained stuck in gridlock, Sullivan made a secret mission to Kyiv, Ukraine, keeping the issue in the headlines.\n\nWith prospects for the aid looking increasingly grim, Biden directed his staff to ensure that intelligence briefings were made available to the Republicans.\n\nJohnson has said that those briefings, led by William Burns, the CIA director, were a crucial factor in winning over his support.\n\nThe aid is broken up into four pieces: a measure for each of the three US allies and another meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that includes a provision that could result in a nationwide ban on TikTok.\n\nThe bill includes $60.8 billion for Ukraine; $26.4 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It also includes sanctions against Iranian and Russian officials.\n\nThe House also added a provision that would require the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion. The idea to give some of the aid to Ukraine in the form of a loan was another example of the influence Trump has over Congress.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_guided_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank guided missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIM-92 Stinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FGM-148 Javelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cluster munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said as he signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air-defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We are sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles. Then we will replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" the president said.\n\nSecretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. \"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. \"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. \"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff

Biden said he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.\n\nThe initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\n\nBiden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion for more than two years. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.\n\nBiden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.\n\n\"This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences,\" he said.\n\nBiden blamed \"MAGA Republicans\" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nHe said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.\n\n\"He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin,\" he said.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe social media platform is particularly popular with left-leaning young Americans, a group crucial to Biden's victory in November.\n\nCongress's stalemate on the Ukraine aid bill ended when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives abruptly changed course and approved four bills that included funding for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other US partners in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday.\n\nBiden and House Speaker Johnson held intense talks about Ukraine in February and the president has both pleaded with Republicans to back the package and scolded them for not doing so. Johnson, who faces calls by some right-leaning Republicans to oust him for his turnaround on aid, met with Trump in Florida earlier this month; the former president said Johnson was \"doing a really good job.\"\n\nThe US Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, passing a sweeping bill that provides $61 billion in aid to the country, which has suffered setbacks in the war that supporters blame on the delay in getting the additional US funding.\n\nHeather Conley, an expert on European affairs, said the victory for US allies and for Biden was tempered by effects that the delay has had for Kiev on the battlefield.\n\n\"This is a strong message of American leadership at a time of enormous instability, but the delay created cracks in that credibility,\" said Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nBiden has argued that he helped restore US credibility on the world stage after Trump's tumultuous four-year tenure, in part by strengthening the NATO alliance and providing a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump has argued for an \"America First\" policy and has threatened to let NATO allies fend for themselves if they do not increase their defense spending.\n\nRepublicans who backed the aid package said it was not a vote for Biden but a reflection of their party's values.\n\n\"Peace through strength. That's our tradition,\" Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said in a Senate speech. \"To my Republican colleagues and friends in the Senate, our tradition is much more serious. It's prouder. And I will tell you this: It's much more supported by the American people.

Join us in this fight.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden announced during a briefing on April 24 he had signed the foreign aid bill containing close to $61 billion for Ukraine into law, marking the final step of the legislative process.\n\nAfter months of political infighting and a deteriorating situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed the crucial foreign aid package on April 20, which includes $60.84 billion for Ukraine.\n\nThe House voted on three separate bills on April 20 granting aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific region, which is intended to address Chinese aggression in the region. In addition to aiding Ukraine, the bills include $26.4 billion to aid Israel and $8.1 billion to be spent on Indo-Pacific security.\n\nA fourth bill on national security priorities catered to Republican goals, including sanctions on Iran, the potential transfer of seized Russian assets to Ukraine, and a measure that could lead to a ban on TikTok.\n\nThe Senate then overwhelmingly approved the bill on April 23, with 79 votes in favor and 18 against.\n\nAfter the Senate vote, Biden said he would very shortly sign the bill into law.\n\nPentagon spokesperson General Pat Ryder said that the flow of U.S. military assistance could resume within days following Biden's signature.\n\n\"Thanks to organizations like the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine and plus our efforts with international allies and partners, we have created a very robust logistics network to enable the delivery of aid into Ukraine,\" Ryder said.\n\nThe new tranche of aid will stem from Biden's presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which takes military equipment from existing stockpiles, meaning that potential procurement-related delays will be limited.\n\nReuters reported on April 23, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that the U.S. was preparing a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine to be issued once Biden signed the bill.\n\nThe $1 billion package will reportedly include vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions, and additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS).\n\nSources told Reuters it would also contain 155-millimeter artillery shells and \"other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\"\n\nSome of the U.S. military aid for Kyiv is already reportedly in Germany and Poland, cutting down the time needed for the weapons and equipment to reach the front line.\n\nOther pieces derived from the $61 billion package may take more time, as they may need to be sent from the U.S. or other locations. Some potential items of military aid will also need to be purchased or even manufactured, which will take even longer.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv

Now we need to move fast, and we are,\" Biden said at the White House event to announce the signing.\n\nBiden also signed an initial aid package of military assistance and said the shipment of weapons and equipment would start in the \"next few hours.\" It will be the first tranche of the $60 billion assistance package for Ukraine approved by the Senate, Congress, and the US president, according to US officials.\n\nUS Senate advances Ukraine aid bill as Pentagon set to send $ 1 bn package once bill clears Senate and Biden\n\nIt is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, and other weapons to boost the capabilities of the Ukrainian forces, who have seen morale sink after months of Russian attacks and assaults.\n\nDespite receiving substantial financial support, Ukraine's ability to maintain American political backing remains uncertain. After enduring months of losses in the eastern region and significant damage to its infrastructure, it remains to be seen if Ukraine can make sufficient progress before exhausting the latest influx of funds.\n\nCurrently, Russia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to create a \"sanitary zone,\" which was announced by Russian leader Vladimir Putin, clear from civilians and military. Russian forces launch dozens of air assaults on the city daily, destroying its energy infrastructure.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression. Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face,\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nIn turn, former US President Donald Trump accused European allies of not doing enough to help Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the funding package, his tone has shifted recently, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is vital to the US after Iran attacks Israel.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a Trump presidency would mean decreased US support for Ukraine and the NATO military alliance. These concerns were exacerbated in February when Trump suggested in a campaign speech that he would not intervene if Russia acted aggressively towards countries failing to meet defense spending targets.\n\nWhile the $61 billion aid package can provide crucial support to Ukrainian forces, military experts warn that Kyiv will require significantly more assistance for what could be a protracted war. Realistic objectives for Ukraine and its allies in the coming months include preventing the loss of main cities, stopping Russia's advance, and supplying additional weaponry to Kyiv to enhance its offensive capabilities in 2025, according to Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of significant cities, slowing Russia's momentum, and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States.\n\nThe US president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there is a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will make a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep US data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation.\n\n\"This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nMr Biden underscored that the Bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza, suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nMr Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

President Joe Biden asserted that countries like China, Iran, and North Korea are aiding Russia in the conflict.\n\nPresident Biden accused Russian President Vladimir Putin's allies of providing significant support to Russia, including drones from Iran, ballistic missiles and artillery shells from North Korea, and defense components and expertise from China.\n\nBiden made these remarks while signing the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and bolstering security efforts in the Indo-Pacific region, including support for Taiwan.\n\nHighlighting Russia's intensified airstrikes on Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, Biden stressed on America's commitment to providing Ukraine with the necessary supplies to continue its defense against the invasion.\n\nFollowing Biden's statement, the United States promptly commenced the shipment and airlift of equipment to Ukraine, including air-defense munitions, artillery, rocket systems, and armored vehicles. President Biden underscored that this assistance not only enhances Ukraine's security but also contributes to the security of Europe and the United States.\n\n\"We are sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles. Then we will replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" the president said.\n\nSecretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. \"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support - together with some 50 allies and partners - to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. \"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. \"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

short of ammunition and suffered battlefield setbacks.\n\n\"I just signed into law the national security package that was passed by the House of Representatives this weekend, and by the Senate yesterday,\" Biden told reporters, saying he is \"making sure the shipments start right away, in the next few hours.\"\n\nMinutes after Biden spoke, the Pentagon announced a $1 billion package for Kyiv using the new funding, including air defense munitions, artillery rounds, ammunition for HIMARS precision rocket launchers, anti-tank weapons and armored vehicles.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly expressed thanks on social media.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans who recognize that we must cut the ground under Putin's feet rather than

March that was only made possible by using money that the Pentagon had saved on other purchases.\n\nThe State Department confirmed Wednesday that the United States had secretly sent long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine as part of the March assistance package, fulfilling a long-standing request from Kyiv.\n\n\"We did not announce this at the onset in order to maintain operational security for

Sullivan said Wednesday that it is \"certainly possible that Russia could make additional tactical gains in the coming weeks.\"\n\nThe bill signed by Biden also provides for much-needed humanitarian assistance to Sudan, Haiti and Gaza, with the president calling on Israel to allow aid to quickly reach Palestinians in the war-racked coastal enclave.\n\n\"We're going to immediately secure that aid

Of this, $23.2 billion is intended to replenish U.S. weapons stocks.\n\nIn addition to aid to Ukraine, the package also includes $26 billion in aid to Israel, $8 billion in support of U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as provisions for new sanctions against Russia, China and Iran and powers for the U.S. president to use frozen Russian assets in favor of Ukraine.\n\nOn April 23, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with U.S. President Joseph Biden, during which Biden assured him that if the bill was approved by the Senate, he would immediately sign the law. The heads of state also discussed joint defense production and U.S. participation in the aviation coalition, as well as the signing of a security agreement with the United States, preparations for the inaugural peace summit and the NATO anniversary summit in Washington in July 2024.\n\nIn turn, the White House website confirms Biden's words that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages for Ukraine in combat and air defense, once the Senate passes the additional national security package and he signs it into law.", "source": {"uri":

However an unexpected turn from House Speaker Mike Johnson led the House to approve legislation over the weekend. with the Senate passing the package in a bipartisan vote Tuesday evening.

The legislation also features provisions to allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs, and a measure that could eventually lead to the ban of TikTok in the United States - giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else it will be banned from app stores in the United States.\n\nThe Pentagon announced a new round of military aid for Ukraine worth roughly $1 billion, with the president adding that the U.S. would begin sending weapons and military equipment to Ukraine \"in the next few hours.

The Senate approved a foreign aid package on Tuesday night that includes $61 billion for the war torn Ukraine. The first tranche of weapons is expected to land in Kyiv within days.\n\n'I'm making sure the shipment starts right away,' President Joe Biden said Wednesday shortly after he signed the bill at the White House . 'In the next few hours, literally, a few hours.' Within minutes of Biden's announcement, the Pentagon released a detailed list of weapons and equipment headed toward Kyiv.\n\nFor the first time, the aid package will include long-range ATACMS, or Army Tactical Missile Systems. Kyiv has pledged not to use the weapons inside Russian territory. The aid package also includes Bradley fighting vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions, demolition weaponry and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield, officials told Reuters.\n\nThe overall $95 billion foreign aid package, which includes billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, after months of frustration. Speaker Mike Johnson pulled together a bipartisan coalition to approve the legislation as several members of his conservative wing opposed it.\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place and is 'doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly' once the bill is signed. Ryder said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and can tap into those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\n'We certainly understand and appreciate the urgency and are poised to move quickly,' he said. Russia has increased its bombardment of Ukraine in recent weeks. American military officials have described the situation in Ukraine as 'dire.'\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns testified to Congress earlier this month that Ukraine could lose the war by the end of this year without U.S. support. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers recently that Russia is making gains, as Ukraine struggles with ammunition shortages.\n\n'We're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in Russia's favor. We are seeing them make incremental gains. We're seeing the Ukrainians be challenged in terms of holding the line,' he said. The latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front.\n\nSince Russia's invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. Meanwhile, the U.K. on Tuesday, pledged an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lolita_c_baldor@thestar.com", "name": "Lolita C.

The Senate is expected to vote on several bills, including the Ukraine bill, which also includes provisions for further Presidential Drawdown Authority. This aid package aims to support Ukraine against Russia's increasing military pressure.The United States is preparing a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine, the first to be sourced from the yet to be signed Ukraine-Israel bill, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had asked the U.S. Congress to provide $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, but the initiative stalled when Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to move the measure forward for months.\n\nOn Tuesday the Senate was expected to vote on four bills now passed by the House.

This added to the $3.9 billion remaining from previously authorized PDA means Biden can transfer $11.9 billion worth of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.\n\nAs the replenishment funds are deployed, U.S. defense companies would gain more contracts as the Russia-Ukraine war grinds on.\n\nExperts expect a boost in the order backlog of RTX along

In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" the president said.\n\nSecretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. \"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. \"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. \"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.

It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\n0

Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.\n\nThe initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\n\nBiden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine.

BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said as he signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air-defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We are sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles. Then we will replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" the president said.\n\nSecretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. \"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. \"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. \"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approval was expected either Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nThe votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday at the Pentagon in Washington. Kevin Wolf/Associated Press\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement reflects President Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelensky attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nRelated Headlines Ukrainian and Western leaders laud U.S. aid package while Kremlin warns of 'further ruin' Zelensky urges U.S. to send weapons quickly ahead of Russian offensive\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

In the next few hours, literally in a few hours, we are going to begin sending in equipment to Ukraine for air defense, munitions for artillery, for rocket systems, and armored vehicles,\" the U.S. president said.\n\nHe emphasized that this package is long-awaited and vital for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield, as well as for residents of peaceful cities who suffer from Russian missile and drone strikes.\n\nIn this regard, Biden noted that he was amazed by reports of cheers breaking out of the trenches in Eastern Ukraine after the House of Representatives finally passed a bill laying down aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, the White House chief emphasized that defense assistance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine is an investment in the security of Ukraine, Europe, and the United States.\n\n\"We're sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles. Then we'll replace those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriots made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas,\" Biden explained.\n\nIn other words, the US is helping Ukraine while investing in its own industrial base and supporting jobs at businesses in nearly 40 states across America.\n\nThe U.S. president also noted the role of Europe and other allies, which also continue to send in support to Ukraine, as everyone understands that it is about collective security.\n\n\"If Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of the Russian Russian forces could well be a direct attack on NATO allies,\" Biden continued.\n\nThis, he said, would trigger action under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which states that an attack on one is an attack on all. This would mean that America would send its own men and women into battle just as U.S. allies from NATO came to America's aid after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nBiden explained that this is precisely the reason the U.S. has been supporting Ukraine and is now increasing this support - in order to prevent Putin from dragging the United States into a war in Europe in the future.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, on Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law H.R. 815 on national security supplemental, which includes more than $60 billion in support for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ukrinform-EN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trench warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrinform", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrinform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2024_04/thumb_files/630_360_1712996679-813.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it is unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nPolitics Is the US banning TikTok? Your key questions answered The Associated Press\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation.

Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nTwo

The first tranche of weapons is expected to land in Kyiv within days.\n\n'I'm making sure the shipment start right away,' President Joe Biden said Wednesday shortly after he signed the bill at the White House. 'In the next few hours, literally, a few hours.'\n\nWithin minutes of Biden's announcement, the Pentagon released a detailed list of weapons and equipment headed toward Kyiv.\n\nThe new round of aid comes as it was revealed the Biden administration last month secretly shipped long-range missiles to Ukraine for the first time.\n\nKyiv has already used the weapon twice to strike deep behind Russian lines, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight.\n\nThe new missiles give Ukraine nearly double the striking distance - up to 190 miles - that it had with the mid-range version of the weapon that it received from the U.S. last October.\n\nMore long-range missiles are expected to be sent as part of the latest aid package.\n\nBiden approved delivery of the long-range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in early March, and the U.S. included a 'significant' number of them in a $300 million aid package announced at the time, a US official said.\n\nThe aid package also includes Bradley fighting vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions, demolition weaponry and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield, officials told Reuters.\n\nThe overall $95 billion foreign aid package, which including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, after months of frustration.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson pulled together a bipartisan coalition to approve the legislation as several members of his conservative wing opposed it.\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place and is 'doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly' once the bill is signed.\n\nRyder said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and can tap into those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\n'We certainly understand and appreciate the urgency and are poised to move quickly,' he said.\n\nRussia has increased its bombardment of Ukraine in recent weeks. American military officials have described the situation in Ukraine as 'dire.'\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns testified to Congress earlier this month that Ukraine could lose the war by the end of this year without U.S. support.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers recently that Russia is making gains, as Ukraine struggles with ammunition shortages.\n\n'We're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in Russia's favor. We are seeing them make incremental gains. We're seeing the Ukrainians be challenged in terms of holding the line,' he said.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front.\n\nSince Russia's invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. on Tuesday, pledged an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nU.S. sends $1 billion in aid to Ukraine\n\nMinutes after President Joe Biden signed an aid package into Ukraine into law, the Pentagon outlined the equipment headed to Kyiv:\n\n* RIM-7 and AIM-9M missiles for air defense\n\n* Stinger anti-aircraft missiles\n\n* Small arms and additional rounds of small arms ammunition, including .50 caliber rounds to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)\n\n* Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)\n\n* 155mm artillery rounds, including High Explosive and Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions rounds\n\n* 105mm artillery rounds\n\n* 60mm mortar rounds\n\n* Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles\n\n* Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs)\n\n* High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs)\n\n* Logistics support vehicles\n\n* Tactical vehicles to tow and haul equipment\n\n* Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles\n\n* Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems\n\n* Precision aerial munitions\n\n* Airfield support equipment\n\n* Anti-armor mines\n\n* Claymore anti-personnel munitions\n\n* Demolitions munitions for obstacle clearing\n\n* Night vision

Oleksandr Syrski, right, look at a map during their visit to the front line city of Kupiansk, Kharkiv region, Ukraine, in November.\n\nWASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today the U.S. will send badly needed air defense weaponry once the Senate approves a massive national security aid package that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said in a posting on X that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would also include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nUkraine is awaiting U.S. Senate approval after the House this weekend approved the $95 billion package that also includes aid for other allies. It comes after months of delay as some Republican lawmakers opposed further funding for Ukraine and threatened to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., if he allowed a vote to take place.\n\nKyiv needs new firepower as Moscow has stepped up its attacks against an outgunned Ukraine. The Senate is expected to vote on the package this week, and Biden has promised to quickly sign it into law.\n\nZelenskyy said he and Biden also discussed \"Russia's air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\" including a strike on the Kharkiv TV tower just minutes before they spoke.\n\n\"Russia clearly signals its intention to make the city uninhabitable,\" Zelenskky said\n\nRussia has exploited air defense shortages in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to pummel the region's energy infrastructure and harm its 1.3 million residents. Some officials and analysts warn it could be a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for a summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nThe White House in a statement confirmed that Biden told Zelenskyy \"that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\"\n\n\"President Biden also underscored that the U.S. economic assistance will help maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,\" according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of U.S. Congress members today met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The delegation included Reps. Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, Bill Keating, D-Mass., and Madeleine Deane, D-Pa.\n\nKean told reporters \"we know that the needs of Ukraine are urgent\" and U.S. aid is \"crucial to stem the tide of Russia's assaults.\"\n\nKean said Biden should use the authority in the bill to quickly deliver to Ukraine the weapons that it has requested, including longer-range ATACM missiles.\n\nZelenskyy said that he discussed with the U.S. lawmakers Ukraine's need for artillery shells, long-range missiles, electronic warfare equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aviation and support in developing the Ukrainian defense industry.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraine's bid to eventually join NATO, U.S. participation in an international conference in Switzerland in June aimed at charting a path toward peace in Ukraine, and other issues.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It comes after months of delay as some Republican lawmakers opposed further funding for Ukraine and threatened to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., if he allowed a vote to take place.\n\nKyiv badly needs new firepower as Moscow has stepped up its attacks against an outgunned Ukraine. The Senate is expected to vote on the package this week, and Biden has promised to quickly sign it into law.\n\nZelenskyy said he and Biden also discussed \"Russia's air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\" including a strike on the Kharkiv TV tower just minutes before they spoke.\n\n\"Russia clearly signals its intention to make the city uninhabitable,\" Zelenskky said\n\nRussia has exploited air defense shortages in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to pummel the region's energy infrastructure and harm its 1.3 million residents. Some officials and analysts warn it could be a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for a summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nThe White House in a statement confirmed that Biden told Zelenskyy \"that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\"\n\n\"President Biden also underscored that the U.S. economic assistance will help maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,\" according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of U.S. Congress members on Monday met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The delegation included Reps. Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, Bill Keating, D-Mass., and Madeleine Deane, D-Pa.\n\nKean told reporters \"we know that the needs of Ukraine are urgent\" and U.S. aid is \"crucial to stem the tide of Russia's assaults.\"\n\nKean said Biden should use the authority in the bill to quickly deliver to Ukraine the weapons that it has requested, including longer-range ATACM missiles.\n\nZelenskyy said that he discussed with the U.S. lawmakers Ukraine's need for artillery shells, long-range missiles, electronic warfare equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aviation and support in developing the Ukrainian defense industry.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraine's bid to eventually join NATO, U.S. participation in an international conference in Switzerland in June aimed at charting a path toward peace in Ukraine, and other issues.\n\n-- --\n\nAP writer Jill Lawless in Kyiv contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My

It's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world,\" Biden said during a briefing following the signing ceremony. \"It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty and the lives and freedom of their citizens.\"\n\nThe president said that the security supplemental, worth about $95 billion, is not just an investment in the security of U.S. partners around the world, but also in U.S. security at home and abroad.\n\n\"This is directly in the United States' national security interest,\" Biden said. \"If Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally.\"\n\nIf that happened, Biden said, the U.S., as a NATO partner, would be bound to assist.\n\n\"We'd have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 attacks,\" he said. \"That's why we're supporting and surging support now to Ukraine, to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe.\"\n\nAmong expenditures in the security supplemental package is more than $60 billion for support to Ukraine. Biden said that assistance will begin to flow immediately, initially as part of a new package of security assistance through presidential drawdown authority, which involves military equipment pulled from existing U.S. inventory.\n\n\"I'm making sure the shipments start right away,\" he said. \"In the next few hours -- literally, a few hours -- we're going to begin sending in equipment to Ukraine for air defense munitions, for artillery, for rocket systems and armored vehicles.\"\n\nShortly after the president spoke, the Defense Department released details of a $1 billion security assistance package for Ukraine which includes, among other things, RIM-7 and AIM-9M missiles; Stinger anti-aircraft missiles; tube-launched, optically-tracked, wire-guided, or TOW, missiles; ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System; 155 mm and 105 mm artillery shells; and a variety of combat vehicles.\n\nThe bill also includes some $14.1 billion for funding to support Israel, Biden said.\n\nEarlier this month, on April 13, Iran and its proxy groups launched more than 300 airborne weapons at targets in Israel, but the U.S., Israeli and partner forces destroyed a significant portion of them before they reached their targets. The president said the U.S. remains committed to Israeli security.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel, I want to make clear again, is ironclad,\" Biden said \"The security of Israel is critical, and we'll always make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and the terrorists it supports.\"\n\nThe supplemental security bill, Biden said, helps Israel replenish its air defense capabilities and also provides for additional defense needs.\n\nThe supplemental funding also provides $9.5 billion for humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine and other populations caught in conflict zones across the globe.\n\n\"This bill includes $1 billion for additional humanitarian aid in Gaza,\" he said. \"We're going to immediately secure that aid and surge it ... including food, medical supplies [and] clean water.\"\n\nAlso included in the bill is funding for partners in the Indo-Pacific region, and humanitarian aid for Haiti, Biden said.\n\n\"This [bill] is a reminder what America can do when we come together, despite our differences,\" he said. \"I want to thank everyone in Congress who made it possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov",

JD Vance (R-Ohio), who led the opposition among Senate Republicans to pouring tens of billions of more dollars into the war effort.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday the new military aid package for Ukraine will last through the end of the year, raising the prospect that a new infusion of weapons and funding may be needed quickly in 2025.\n\nThat could make Ukraine's war with Russia, and U.S. support for Kyiv, a major issue in the presidential race between Biden and former President Trump and in the battles for the House and Senate.\n\nThe presidential and House races are both considered toss-ups, while Republicans are widely seen as favorites to win the Senate majority given a highly favorable map.\n\n\"So much of what happens next depends on the outcome of the November election,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\n\nSullivan on Wednesday said there's a \"deep reservoir\" of support for Ukraine in both parties.\n\nBut he acknowledged Ukrainian setbacks in the war because of dwindling supplies, telling reporters Ukraine has had to ration ammunition and is under \"severe pressure on the battlefield.\"\n\n\"It's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay before Congress passed the supplemental,\" he said.\n\nThere is support for Ukraine in both chambers of Congress, but House GOP support has been declining. While Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) brought legislation to the floor, he did so at risk to his political future. A majority of House Republicans voted against more aid to Ukraine, and some conservatives are threatening to oust Johnson as Speaker.\n\nA majority of GOP senators did back aid to Ukraine, and McConnell won nine more Republican votes than on a package earlier this year.\n\nStill, Vance noted Republican support for underwriting an open-ended war against Russia has dipped significantly over the past two years.\n\n\"I think it's going to be really hard to get a package out of Congress,\" said Vance, who argued in a recent New York Times op-ed that the military aid package approved this week won't turn the tide of the war.\n\n\"Fundamentally, we lack the capacity to manufacture the amount of weapons Ukraine needs us to supply to win the war,\" Vance wrote in an essay that made waves on Capitol Hill.\n\nMcConnell, however, told reporters Tuesday that Republicans who support sending more military aid to Ukraine are winning the argument with colleagues he called \"isolationists.\"\n\n\"I think we've turned the corner on the isolationist movement,\" he argued to reporters. \"I think we've made some progress.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) praised the bill that passed Tuesday as \"a very full package\" but declined to say how long it will keep Ukrainian forces supplied on the battlefield.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who voted for the $95 billion emergency foreign aid bill, which President Biden quickly signed into law, says more future aid will need to be structured as a loan.\n\n\"The loan component's going to be bigger, not smaller. If you want more for Ukraine in the future, it'll be more of a loan,\" he said.\n\nTo attract more Republican support for the package that passed this week, House leaders structured $9.5 billion worth of economic assistance as forgivable loans to help Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure needs, as well as help other countries impacted by the war.\n\nTo supporters of Ukraine aid, the question is not a matter of if, but rather when Ukraine will need another tranche of assistance.\n\nSenators in both parties expect the $61 billion Congress approved this week will cover Kyiv through November and potentially the end of the year. This tees up a fight in the lame-duck session after the November election over whether to continue U.S. support for the war at its current level.\n\n\"There's no question we're going to have to have another one. Whether or not we can even get through this year is a question. There could easily be something in the lame duck. We've got to be there as long as [Russian President Vladimir Putin] is,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).\n\nLawmakers have little idea of what to expect if former President Trump wins another term, given his constantly evolving stance on the war.\n\nTrump urged Republican senators to defeat the first version of the $95 billion foreign package they passed in February, but in recent weeks, he has softened his position against sending billions of dollars more to Ukraine after Johnson insisted on structuring the economic assistance as a forgivable loan.\n\nTrump allies said the former president also played an influential role in convincing lawmakers to add the REPO Act to the package, which authorizes the seizure of Russian assets to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\nBut the possibility of Trump returning to the White House is fueling anxiety among Democrats over Ukraine's future, given his past statements.\n\nA Republican congressional aide said Department of Defense officials and European allies will begin putting together a new funding request for Ukraine in September and for it to come to Congress in the lame-duck session.\n\n\"I would expect it in the lame-duck,\" said the source. \"If Biden loses, does he submit a supplemental before Trump is in office? The incoming administration would have to be consulted significantly.\"\n\nLawmakers who support funding for Ukraine do feel encouraged by the strong bipartisan votes that propelled the emergency spending package through the Senate and House.\n\nThirty-one Senate Republicans joined with almost every Democrat to push the package across the finish line -- an uptick of nine GOP members from the February vote. Ukraine advocates believe this gives them the wind in their sails when they inevitably push for another package.\n\n\"This is a pretty overwhelming vote,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said of the 31 Senate Republicans who joined a large majority of the Senate Democratic caucus in approving Ukraine funding this week. \"I don't think anybody should question our commitment.\"\n\nCornyn is vying with Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) to replace McConnell, the biggest champion of supporting the war in the Senate GOP conference, as party leader.\n\nRepublicans say they are encouraged Trump decided not to tank the Ukraine funding bill after meeting with the Speaker at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nGOP senators say Trump can be persuaded to change his mind on some issues and believe they can convince him to support more aid for Ukraine if he wins in November.\n\n\"I think it is [possible],\" Tillis said. \"I think [Trump] when he is fully briefed and his administration is overseeing the execution of it, yeah, I think he'll support it. I don't know that it would be one of his top priorities, but I do think he'll support it.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States.\n\nThe president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there is a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will make a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep US data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation.\n\n\"This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nMr Biden underscored that the Bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza, suffering as the Israel-Hamas war

Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,\" Biden said as he signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n\"With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" Biden said. Hours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air-defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden said. \"We are sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles. Then we will replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" the president said. Secretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said. \"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement. The Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks. \"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said. Biden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally.\n\n\"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said. \"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. \"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The first tranche of weapons is expected to land in Kyiv within days.\n\n'I'm making sure the shipment start right away,' President Joe Biden said Wednesday shortly after he signed the bill at the White House. 'In the next few hours, literally, a few hours.'\n\nWithin minutes of Biden's announcement, the Pentagon released a detailed list of weapons and equipment headed toward Kyiv.\n\nFor the first time the aid package will include long-range ATACMS, or Army Tactical Missile Systems. Kyiv has pledged not to use the weapons inside Russian territory.\n\nThe aid package also includes Bradley fighting vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions, demolition weaponry and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield, officials told Reuters.\n\nThe overall $95 billion foreign aid package, which including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, after months of frustration.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson pulled together a bipartisan coalition to approve the legislation as several members of his conservative wing opposed it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Wednesday\n\nUkrainian servicemen of the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, fire a BM-21 Grad multiple launch rocket system towards Russian troops\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj.

American military officials have described the situation in Ukraine as 'dire.'\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns testified to Congress earlier this month that Ukraine could lose the war by the end of this year without U.S. support.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers recently that Russia is making gains, as Ukraine struggles with ammunition shortages.\n\n'We're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in Russia's favor. We are seeing them make incremental gains.

front.\n\nSince Russia's invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. on Tuesday,

Biden said he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.\n\nThe initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\n\nBiden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.\n\n\"This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences,\" he said.\n\nBiden blamed \"MAGA Republicans\" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nHe said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.\n\n\"He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin,\" he said.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe social media platform is particularly popular with left-leaning young Americans, a group crucial to Biden's victory in November.\n\nThe U.S. Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, passing a sweeping bill that provides $61 billion in aid to the country, which has suffered setbacks in the war that supporters blame on the delay in getting the additional U.S. funding.\n\nBiden has argued that he helped restore U.S. credibility on the world stage after Trump's tumultuous four-year tenure, in part by strengthening the NATO alliance and providing a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump has argued for an \"America First\" policy and has threatened to let NATO allies fend for themselves if they do not increase their defense spending.\n\nRepublicans who backed the aid package said it was not a vote for Biden but a reflection of their party's values.",

Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production,'' Biden said as he signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan.\n\n''With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now, America is going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,'' Biden said.\n\nHours later, the United States started shipping and airlifting equipment to Ukraine for air-defence munitions, artillery, rocket systems and armoured vehicles. ''This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,'' Biden said.\n\n''We are sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles. Then we will replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,'' the president said.\n\nSecretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. ''This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,'' he said.\n\n''We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,'' Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n''With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,'' the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. ''You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,'' he said.\n\n''That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,'' Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. ''The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,'' he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

It will make the world safer. And it will continue America's leadership in the world,\" Biden said during a press conference after the signing ceremony. \"It provides vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty and the lives and liberties of their citizens.\"\n\nThe president said the security supplement, worth about $95 billion, is not only an investment in the security of America's partners around the world, but also in the security of the United States at home and abroad.\n\n\"This is directly in the national security interest of the United States,\" Biden said. \"If Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move by Russian forces may well be a direct attack on a niton ally.\"\n\nIf that were to happen, Biden said, the US, as a NATO partner, would be obliged to help.\n\n\"We would have no choice but to come to their aid, just as our NATO allies came to our aid after the 9/11 attacks,\" he said. \"That's why we are supporting and increasing support now for Ukraine, to stop Putin from dragging the United States into a war in Europe.\"\n\nAmong the expenses in the additional security package are more than 60 billion dollars to support Ukraine. Biden said the aid would begin flowing immediately, initially as part of a new package of security assistance through the president's withdrawal authority, which includes military equipment drawn from the existing US inventory.\n\n\"I am making sure that the deliveries start immediately,\" he said. \"In the next few hours - literally, a few hours - we will start sending equipment to Ukraine for air defense munitions, for artillery, for missile systems and armored vehicles.\"\n\nShortly after the president's speech, the Defense Department released details of a $1 billion security assistance package for Ukraine, which includes, among other things, RIM-7 and AIM-9M missiles; Stinger anti-aircraft missiles; tube-launched, optically-tracked, wire-guided or TOW missiles; ammunition for the high-mobility artillery rocket system; 155 mm and 105 mm artillery shells; and a variety of weapons of war.\n\nThe bill also includes about $14.1 billion in funding to support Israel, Biden said.\n\nEarlier this month, on April 13, Iran and its proxies launched more than 300 aerial weapons at targets in Israel, but US, Israeli and partner forces destroyed a significant number of them before they reached their targets. The president said the US remains committed to Israeli security.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel, I want to make it clear again, is ironclad,\" Biden said. \"Israel's security is critical, and we will always make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and the terrorists it supports. .\"\n\nThe additional security bill, Biden said, helps Israel supplement its air defense capabilities and also provides additional defense needs.\n\nThe additional funding also provides $9.5 billion for humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine and other populations caught in conflict zones around the globe.\n\n\"This bill includes $1 billion in additional humanitarian aid to Gaza,\" he said. \"We will immediately provide that assistance and increase it ... including food, medical supplies [and] clean water.\"\n\nAlso included in the bill is funding for partners in the Indo-Pacific region and humanitarian aid for Haiti, Biden said.\n\n\"This [bill] it's a reminder of what America can do when we come together, despite our differences,\" he said. \"I want to thank everyone in Congress for making it possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

Ukraine is awaiting US Senate approval after the House this weekend approved the USD 95 billion package that also includes aid for other allies. It comes after months of delay as some Republican lawmakers opposed further funding for Ukraine and threatened to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., if he allowed a vote to take place. Kyiv badly needs new firepower as Moscow has stepped up its attacks against an outgunned Ukraine.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the package this week, and Biden has promised to quickly sign it into law. Zelenskyy said he and Biden also discussed \"Russia's air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\" including a strike on the Kharkiv TV tower just minutes before they spoke. \"Russia clearly signals its intention to make the city uninhabitable,\" Zelenskky said Russia has exploited air defence shortages in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to pummel the region's energy infrastructure and harm its 1.3 million residents. Some officials and analysts warn it could be a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for a summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nThe White House in a statement confirmed that Biden told Zelenskyy \"that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\" \"President Biden also underscored that the US economic assistance will help maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,\" according to the White House.

Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, Bill Keating, D-Mass., and Madeleine Deane, D-Pa. Kean told reporters \"we know that the needs of Ukraine are urgent\" and US aid is \"crucial to stem the tide of Russia's assaults.\" Kean said Biden should use the authority in the bill to quickly deliver to Ukraine the weapons that it has requested, including the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. Zelenskyy said that he discussed with the US lawmakers Ukraine's need for artillery shells, long-range missiles, electronic warfare equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aviation and support in developing the Ukrainian defence industry.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraine's bid to eventually join NATO, US participation in an international conference in Switzerland in June aimed at charting a path

Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nGovernment-politics Is the US banning TikTok? Your key questions answered The Associated Press\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\n0

This decision comes at a critical moment as Ukrainian forces grapple with ammunition shortages and battlefield setbacks.\n\n\"I just signed into law the national security package that was passed by the House of Representatives this weekend, and by the Senate yesterday,\" Biden told reporters, saying he is \"making sure the shipments start right away, in the next few hours.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Biden's announcement, the Pentagon revealed a $1 billion aid package for Kyiv, utilizing the fresh funding.\n\nThis comprehensive aid package includes air defense munitions, artillery rounds, ammunition for HIMARS precision rocket launchers, anti-tank weapons, and armored vehicles.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly expressed gratitude on social media.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans who recognize that we must cut the ground under Putin's feet rather than obeying him, as this is the only way to truly reduce threats to freedom,\" he wrote.\n\nThis marks the second time this year that Washington has announced new aid for Ukraine. In March, a $300 million package was provided, made possible by reallocating funds saved by the Pentagon from other purchases.\n\nConfirming on Wednesday, the State Department disclosed that the United States had covertly shipped long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine as part of the March assistance package, fulfilling a longstanding request from Kyiv.\n\n\"We refrained from announcing this initially to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" said State Department spokesman Vedant Patel.\n\nThe bill signed by Biden on Wednesday passed after months of heated debate among lawmakers over how, or even whether, to aid Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion, launched by Moscow in February 2022.\n\nFacing a severe shortage of arms and recruits as Moscow applies constant pressure from the east, Ukraine's military is in dire need.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned on Wednesday that \"it is certainly possible that Russia could make additional tactical gains in the coming weeks.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ukraine's commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrski, said Russia's top military leadership ordered its soldiers to capture the town of [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday the U.S. will send badly needed air defense weaponry once the Senate approves a massive national security aid package that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said in a posting on X that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would also include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nUkraine is awaiting U.S. Senate approval after the House this weekend approved the $95 billion package that also includes aid for other allies. It comes after months of delay as some Republican lawmakers opposed further funding for Ukraine and threatened to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., if he allowed a vote to take place.\n\nKyiv badly needs new firepower as Moscow has stepped up its attacks against an outgunned Ukraine. The Senate is expected to vote on the package this week, and Biden has promised to quickly sign it into law.\n\nZelenskyy said he and Biden also discussed \"Russia's air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\" including a strike on the Kharkiv TV tower just minutes before they spoke.\n\n\"Russia clearly signals its intention to make the city uninhabitable,\" Zelenskky said\n\nRussia has exploited air defense shortages in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to pummel the region's energy infrastructure and harm its 1.3 million residents. Some officials and analysts warn it could be a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for a summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nThe White House in a statement confirmed that Biden told Zelenskyy \"that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\"\n\n\"President Biden also underscored that the U.S. economic assistance will help maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,\" according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of U.S. Congress members on Monday met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The delegation included Reps. Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, Bill Keating, D-Mass., and Madeleine Deane, D-Pa.\n\nKean told reporters \"we know that the needs of Ukraine are urgent\" and U.S. aid is \"crucial to stem the tide of Russia's assaults.\"\n\nKean said Biden should use the authority in the bill to quickly deliver to Ukraine the weapons that it has requested, including longer-range ATACM missiles.\n\nZelenskyy said that he discussed with the U.S. lawmakers Ukraine's need for artillery shells, long-range missiles, electronic warfare equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aviation and support in developing the Ukrainian defense industry.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraine's bid to eventually join NATO, U.S. participation in an international conference in Switzerland in June aimed at charting a path toward peace in Ukraine, and other issues.\n\n-- --\n\nAP writer Jill Lawless in Kyiv contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Reuters-Yonhap\n\nThe United States is preparing a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine, the first to be sourced from the yet to be signed Ukraine-Israel bill, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had asked the U.S. Congress to provide $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, but the initiative stalled when Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to move the measure forward for months.\n\nOn Tuesday the Senate was expected to vote on four bills now passed by the House. One for Ukraine, a second with $26 billion for Israel, a third with $8.12 billion \"to counter communist China\" in the Indo-Pacific and a fourth that includes a potential ban on the social media app TikTok.\n\nThe Ukraine bill also calls for the transfer of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) with a range of up to 190 miles, which Kyiv has pledged not to use inside Russia's territory.\n\nRussia has increased its long-range bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and its cities in recent weeks, ratcheting up the pressure on Kyiv as Moscow's more numerous and better equipped forces slowly advance on the battlefield in the east.\n\nOnce the Ukraine bill is signed, funds to replenish stocks would rebound, alleviating Pentagon concerns that the use of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to aid Ukraine would compromise U.S. military preparedness.\n\nTens of billions of dollars in the bill was earmarked to buy replacements for weapons sent to Ukraine along with transportation and administrative overhead.\n\nThe bill gives the president $8 billion worth of further Presidential Drawdown Authority. This added to the $3.9 billion remaining from previously authorized PDA means Biden can transfer $11.9 billion worth of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.\n\nAs the replenishment funds are deployed, U.S. defense companies would gain more contracts as the Russia-Ukraine war grinds on.\n\nExperts expect a boost in the order backlog of RTX along with other major companies that receive government contracts, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, following the passage of the supplemental spending bill.

That made Ukraine more desperate for aid as ammunition ran low and Russia pressed forward on the battlefield, putting Ukrainian troops on the backfoot.\n\nA key part of the new package is 155 mm artillery rounds and other mortar and artillery ammunition, along with RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense munitions. Kyiv has made both a priority, with artillery a major part of covering Ukrainian troops on the ground and air defenses crucial to defending cities.\n\nWednesday's package includes Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor launchers, small arms ammunition like .50 caliber rounds and munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.\n\nAnd Ukraine will get Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Humvees and other logistical and tactical vehicles, along with anti-armor mines, demolition material and other spare parts and equipment.\n\nNotably, the package does not include the long-range artillery weapon called the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can strike targets up to 190 miles away. The Biden administration has provided older versions of the ATACMS but not a newer model.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that he called Biden and there was an agreement to provide ATACMS, but he did not provide greater details, including when they might be delivered.\n\nAfter signing the $95 billion national security package into law, about $61 billion of which will go to supporting Ukraine, Biden said it was a \"good day for world peace\".\n\n\"Americans are going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" he stated, promising to start sending equipment within hours.\n\n\"This package is literally an investment in not only Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security.\"\n\nZelensky expressed his thanks after the Senate cleared the package Tuesday night, just days after the House. On Wednesday, Zelensky said the \"key now is speed\".\n\n\"Every leader who does not waste time is a life saver,\" he wrote on social platform X., adding,\"Every state that knows how to act quickly safeguards the rules-based world order.\"\n\nEven with the new weapons package, Ukraine will face an uphill battle against a larger Russian military, which has seized the initiative amid the delay of U.S. assistance to hammer the Ukrainians across the 600-mile eastern front line and press forward in the Donetsk region.\n\nBut the weapons will help to stabilize the front, where Russian forces have taken at least one city and are threatening another strategic one in the eastern Donetsk region.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [],

Following a phone call between the two leaders on April 22, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Biden would sign the bill \"as soon as it is approved by the Senate.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of the final vote in the Senate, Ryder did not provide specifics but said, \"We would expect to be able to deliver aid within days.\"\n\n\"Thanks to organizations like the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine and plus our efforts with international allies and partners, we have created a very robust logistics network to enable the delivery of aid into Ukraine,\" Ryder said.\n\nThe new tranche of aid will stem from Biden's presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which takes military equipment from existing stockpiles, meaning that potential procurement-related delays will be limited.\n\nReuters reported on April 23, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that the U.S. was preparing a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine to be issued once Biden signed the bill.\n\nThe $1 billion package will reportedly include vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions, and additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS).\n\nSources told Reuters it would also contain 155-millimeter artillery shells and \"other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.\"\n\nSome of the U.S. military aid for Kyiv is already reportedly in Germany and Poland, cutting down the time needed for the weapons and equipment to reach the front line.\n\nOther pieces derived from the $61 billion package may take more time, as they may need to be sent from the U.S. or other locations.

It took just a few hours longer for the Department of Defense to announce it was ready to send $1 billion in arms and equipment to eastern Europe.\n\n\"I'm grateful to all those in Congress -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- who voted for this bill. It's path to my desk was a difficult path. It should have been easier, and it should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,\" Biden said after signing the aid package into law.\n\n\"Now we need to move fast, and we are,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Department of Defense, they are already prepared to send \"significant new security assistance\" to Ukraine, including \"air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons.\"\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities, and counter Russia's continued attacks. With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute U.S. leadership to provide consistent security assistance support - together with some 50 Allies and partners - to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the DoD said in a statement.\n\nThis February marked the second anniversary of Russian President Vladimir Putin's unlawful \"special military operation\" against its Democratic neighbor, and for months Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of his country's flagging ability to defend itself in the face of continued Russian aggression without further assistance from the U.S. and other NATO nations.\n\nPassage of the $61 billion aid package through the divided Republican controlled House was met with cheers in the frontline trenches of the ongoing ground war, according to Biden.\n\n\"It's not like they don't understand what we've done. Not like they don't understand how critical this is for them. I'm making sure the shipments start right away. In the next few hours -- literally, the few hours -- we're going to begin sending in equipment to Ukraine for air defense; munitions for artillery, for rocket systems; and armored vehicles,\" Biden said.\n\nZelensky said the aid package is \"vital\" to Ukraine's ability to defend itself, and while thankful, made clear that support was a long time in coming.\n\n\"We will make every effort to compensate for the half-year spent in debates and doubts. We must turn everything the occupier has accomplished during this time, as well as everything Putin intends to do, against him. All of his frontline actions, strikes on our energy system and infrastructure, and terror against our cities and villages must unite us all -- everyone in the world who truly values life -- around the need to increase pressure on Russia,\" he said.\n\nRussia first attacked its fellow former Soviet state since 2014, when Putin illegally annexed Crimea. The conflict, which continued in a pair of separatist regions during the following eight years, exploded into full scale war in February of 2022, when the Russian military further invaded the country on three fronts.\n\nMoscow apparently had planned just days of military actions, but Russian forces have since been stalled in their advances by Ukrainian troops and civilian volunteers armed and trained by a global coalition of nations.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the war has displaced 3.7 million people within Ukraine and caused 6.5 million Ukrainians to flee the country. More than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and over 14 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"},

With Democratic help, the bill passed last week.\n\nSenate then passed its version of it Tuesday night, and Biden signed it into law Wednesday\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, Biden remarked on the delays, stating, \"For months, while MAGA Republicans were blocking aid, Ukraine has been running out of artillery shells and ammunition.\"\n\nMAGA is the acronym for the far-right Make America Great Again nativist political movement, made popular by Trump.\n\nBiden also said a new U.S. package of weaponry would be announced in the next few hours, calling it \"literally an investment, not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our our security.\"\n\n\"We're sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles, and then we'll replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America: Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas,\" he said.\n\n\"In other words, we're helping Ukraine while at the same time investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America.\"\n\nThe package announced Wednesday is the 56th for Ukraine from Pentagon inventories since August of 2021, and completed under the Presidential Drawdown Authority.\n\nIt includes air defense missiles, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, precision aerial munitions and a large variety of ammunition and rounds, including for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, which have proved effect in the theater.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\n\"The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Wednesday thanked Biden, Congress and Americans for supporting its defense against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"The six-month path is now over,\" he said in his nightly address to the nation.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Biden, the U.S. Congress and all Americans who realize the need to take the wind out of Putin's sails, not to submit to him, as only then will there truly be fewer threats to freedom.\"", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors":

According to three US officials, the dynamics on the battlefield have changed dramatically in recent months, partly because Ukraine ran out of weapons and ammunition while the US was debating the aid, on Wednesday, the 24th of April, reports Politico.\n\nUS officials are concerned about Russia's military superiority and question Ukraine's ability to recover months and years of territorial losses, questioning Kyiv's tactics and priorities after the failed counter-offensive operation.\n\n\"The immediate goal is to halt Ukraine's losses and help Ukraine regain momentum\n\nand turn the tide on the battlefield. After that, the goal is to help Ukraine regain its territory,\" one of the officials was quoted as saying. \"Will they have everything they need to win? In principle, yes. But it is not a guarantee that they will achieve it. Military operations are much more complex.\"\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill are also questioning whether increased US aid to Ukraine will ensure victory against Russia or only allow Ukraine to temporarily resist invasion.\n\nBiden, signing the aid package for Ukraine on Wednesday, stressed that Russia is using its military power to attack civilian infrastructure and underlined the need to increase Kyiv power.\n\n\"They have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians\", Biden was quoted as saying, \"bombed hospitals... kindergartens, grain bunkers, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold and dark winter\".\n\nRepresentative Bill Keating, who met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv this week, also expressed concern about Ukraine's ability to make significant gains against Russia, suggesting that\n\nthe conflict could enter a period of stagnation.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that Ukraine still lacks a comprehensive plan to defeat Russia but added that the US is engaged in discussions to refine Ukraine's strategy and will tailor future assistance accordingly.\n\nThe Biden administration has stressed that the outcome of the war will be determined by Ukraine, whether through military victory or negotiations. However, a senior Democratic Senate staffer said that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's commitment to reclaim Crimea and other territories is indicative of a long conflict with an uncertain outcome.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday that the Biden administration regrets the delay in delivering vital aid to Ukraine, acknowledging that Russia could use the gap to make further gains in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We will need time to dig out of the hole we dug by delaying for six months,\" he added.\n\nThe next package for Ukraine will total one billion US dollars and include long-range tactical missile system weapons for the army.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have stressed that the quality of the weapons sent is crucial to Ukraine's success.\n\n\"The administration needs to send high-quality weapons like ATACMS,\" Don Bacon, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, was quoted as saying.\n\nBiden administration officials expect the 60 billion dollars in aid to last until the end of Biden's term, but uncertainty remains over future aid if Biden is not re-elected.\n\nAnalysts argue that the main focus the aid assessment should be on its impact on Ukraine's position against Russia. Samuel Charap of the RAND Corporation has said that the aid could influence Russia's willingness to compromise, moving from a \"win or lose\" scenario to terms that are more favourable to Ukraine's endgame, adding that the aid gives Ukraine an advantage in improving its position.", "source": {"uri": "bnn-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Georgian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Keating_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Keating (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RAND Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bnn-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/53547493762_3d4242639b_k.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 394, "textEnd": 407}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That made Ukraine more desperate for aid as ammunition ran low and Russia pressed forward on the battlefield, putting Ukrainian troops on the backfoot.\n\nA key part of the new package is 155-millimeter artillery rounds and other mortar and artillery ammunition, along with RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense munitions. Kyiv has made both a priority, with artillery a major part of covering Ukrainian troops on the ground and air defenses crucial to defending cities.\n\nWednesday's package includes Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor launchers, small arms ammunition like .50 caliber rounds and munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.\n\nAnd Ukraine will get Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Humvees and other logistical and tactical vehicles, along with anti-armor mines, demolition material and other spare parts and equipment.\n\nNotably, the package does not include the long-range artillery weapon called the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can strike targets up to 190 miles away. The Biden administration has provided older versions of the ATACMS, but not a newer model.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that he called Biden and there was an agreement to provide ATACMS, but he did not provide greater details, including when they might be delivered.\n\nAfter signing the $95 billion national security package into law, about $61 billion of which will go to supporting Ukraine, Biden said it was a \"good day for world peace.\"\n\n\"Americans are going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,\" he said, promising to start sending equipment within hours. \"This package is literally an investment in not only Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security.\"\n\nZelensky expressed his thanks after the Senate cleared the package on Tuesday night, just days after the House. On Wednesday, Zelensky said the \"key now is speed.\"\n\n\"Every leader who does not waste time is a life saver,\" he wrote on X. \"Every state that knows how to act quickly safeguards the rules-based world order.\"\n\nEven with the new weapons package, Ukraine will face an uphill battle against a larger Russian military, which has seized the initiative amid the delay of U.S. assistance to hammer the Ukrainians across the 600-mile eastern frontline and press forward in the Donetsk region.\n\nBut the weapons will help to stabilize the front, where Russian forces have taken at least one city and are threatening another strategic one in the eastern Donetsk region.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-140_ATACMS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM-140 ATACMS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIM-92 Stinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FGM-148 Javelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_BMG", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".50 BMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humvee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortar (weapon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Land mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/TOP-Help-for-Ukraine_041924_AP_Efrem-Lukatsky.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

As I've argued for months, this is directly in America's national security interests.\"\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. commander in chief said air defense and rocket systems, as well as armored vehicles made in America, would be in the first tranche of combat equipment sent under the bipartisan supplemental package.\n\nBiden signed the measure, which he requested last fall, after it passed the Senate Tuesday night in a 79-18 vote. It passed the House Saturday as four different measures, with a floor rule bringing them together as one package, as designed by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. and blessed by Biden.\n\nAs Biden took a victory lap in the White House's Indian Treaty Room during an event that was quickly arranged, Republicans were still smarting from divisions the measure caused in their ranks.\n\nUnlike an earlier version of the measure the Senate passed in February, the revised package won support from a majority of Senate Republicans. A slim majority of House Republicans, however, still opposed the final package.\n\nBiden said the measure had a more \"difficult path than it should have\" to get to his desk, but he applauded lawmakers because \"we came together and got it done.\"\n\n\"Now we need to move fast,\" he said about turning the monies supplied by the emergency spending measure into combat shipments. \"And we are.\"\n\nThe president also warned that China, Iran, North Korea and other countries are providing Russian forces with new weapons. \"Meanwhile, Putin's friends have kept him well-supplied. With all that support, Russia has stepped up its airstrikes,\" he warned.\n\nBiden also touted the military aid the measure will send to Israel, and humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians inside the war-torn Gaza strip.\n\nThe U.S. has always \"made sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and the terrorists it supports,\" Biden said, touting $1 billion the measure will provide for \"food, medical supplies, clean water\" in Gaza. He added, \"Israel must make sure all of this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza -- without delay.\"\n\nBiden also applauded congressional leadership for negotiating the substance of a measure.\n\n\"They don't always get along,\" he said. \"But when you look over the past few years, we've seen time and again on critical issues, we've actually come together. ... That's exactly what will continue.\"\n\nBiden has been in full campaign mode this spring, with two more days on the trail planned this week. Despite his celebratory tone on Wednesday, the national security spending measure is not that popular with voters.\n\n\"Just over 4 in 10 (43 percent) of Americans are in favor of the recently passed bills to provide aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, while 35 percent are opposed,\" according to a Monmouth University Polling Institute summary of a survey of adults nationwide conducted April 18-22. \"Another 21 percent have no opinion. Democrats broadly support the foreign aid package (65 percent favor and 14 percent oppose), while Republicans (30 percent favor and 44 percent oppose) and independents (36 percent favor and 45 percent oppose) are somewhat more likely to be against than for the deal.\"\n\n\"The foreign aid package may be a big policy win, but politically it's a wash for Speaker Johnson,\" Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth institute said in the summary.\n\nPentagon details shipments\n\nIn the minutes after Biden announced he signed the bill, the Pentagon unveiled a $1 billion aid package for Ukraine, supplying the country with much-needed air defense systems, artillery rounds and anti-tank weapons.\n\nThat includes 155mm artillery rounds, including dual-purpose improved conventional munitions, or DPICMs; 60mm mortar rounds; additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems; Bradley Fighting Vehicles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; precision aerial munitions; and more.\n\nThe capabilities, which will be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent abroad, represent the first tranche of military support for Kyiv since mid-March, when Defense Department officials cobbled together savings from a number of previous Army contracts to cover a $300 million shipment of equipment.\n\nBut the Pentagon's ability to support Ukraine further had been hampered since December by the lack of funds to backfill U.S. military inventories. Though some $4 billion had remained in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine, officials were reluctant to tap into that authority without additional replenishment funds, or money that's used to buy back capabilities sent overseas.\n\nThat changed with the signing of the supplemental bill, which allocates $23.2 billion to replenish U.S. defense articles and defense services provided to Ukraine, $11.3 billion for current U.S. military operations in that region and $13.8 billion for the procurement of still more weapons and services.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

But Mr Johnson defied the party's rebels at the weekend, and their effort to remove him has sputtered.\n\n[ Inside US House speaker Mike Johnson's conversion on aid for Ukraine ]\n\nMr Biden said the bill's passage - despite months of delay - was a sign that a political consensus on the US's national security interests was still in place.\n\n\"We don't walk away from our allies, we stand with them,\" Mr Biden said. \"We don't let tyrants win, we oppose them. We don't merely watch global events unfold, we shape them.\"\n\nMr Biden added: \"That's what it means to be the 'indispensable nation'. That's what it means to be the world's superpower and the world's leading democracy.\"\n\nThe new aid package from the Pentagon includes Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, 155mm artillery rounds, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, TOW missiles, Javelins and other weapons and ammunition, according to the Pentagon.\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its front lines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said he had discussed the $1 billion package with Mr Biden during a phone call on Monday.\n\n\"Over the past few days, we have already been actively working with our American friends on all levels to include the exact types of weapons that our warriors require in this package,\" Mr Zelenskiy said.\n\nThe rest of the $95 billion in aid is earmarked for Israel and Taiwan. The legislation also includes a provision that requires the Chinese group ByteDance, the parent of TikTok, to divest the popular video app.\n\nTikTok said it would file a legal challenge against what it described as an \"unconstitutional law\" that amounted to a \"ban\" that would \"devastate 7 million businesses and silence 170 million Americans\".\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail. The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep US data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation,\" TikTok said.\n\nMr Biden and his most senior aides have been sounding increasingly dire warnings about the implications of the failure to aid Ukraine, with the lapse in funding so far this year already leading to setbacks on the battlefield.\n\n\"Had we failed to step up, Lord only knows what would happen to the cohesion of Nato,\" Mr Biden said. He added that if Russian leader Vladimir Putin \"triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a Nato ally\" and the US would \"have no choice but to come to their aid\".\n\nMr Zelenskiy said he was \"grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans who recognise that we must cut the ground under Putin's feet rather than obeying him, as this is

The Senate is expected to vote on the package this week, and Biden has promised to quickly sign it into law.\n\nZelenskyy said he and Biden also discussed \"Russia's air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\" including a strike on the Kharkiv TV tower just minutes before they spoke.\n\n\"Russia clearly signals its intention to make the city uninhabitable,\" Zelenskky said\n\nRussia has exploited air defence shortages in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to pummel the region's energy infrastructure and harm its 1.3 million residents. Some officials and analysts warn it could be a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for a summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nThe White House in a statement confirmed that Biden told Zelenskyy \"that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\"\n\n\"President Biden also underscored that the US economic assistance will help maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,\" according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of US Congress members on Monday met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The delegation included Reps. Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, Bill Keating, D-Mass., and Madeleine Deane, D-Pa.\n\nKean told reporters \"we know that the needs of Ukraine are urgent\" and US aid is \"crucial to stem the tide of Russia's assaults.\"\n\nKean said Biden should use the authority in the bill to quickly deliver to Ukraine the weapons that it has requested, including the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS.\n\nZelenskyy said that he discussed with the US lawmakers Ukraine's need for artillery shells, long-range missiles, electronic warfare equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aviation and support in developing the Ukrainian defence industry.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraine's bid to eventually join NATO, US participation in an international conference in Switzerland in June aimed at charting a path toward peace in Ukraine, and other issues.

The Pentagon hailed Congress' \"bipartisan\" support of Ukraine after the Senate late Tuesday passed a $95 billion foreign aid supplemental by a vote of 79 to 18, sending it to Biden's desk.\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities, and counter Russia's continued attacks,\" the statement read.\n\nThe bill authorized up to $60.8 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, $15 billion in weapons and $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Israel, and $8 billion for Taiwan, among other provisions.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute U.S. leadership to provide consistent security assistance support - together with some 50 Allies and partners - to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the statement read.\n\nBiden used Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to authorize the package, meaning the Pentagon will pull equipment from existing U.S. stockpiles, according to the DOD.\n\nThe package includes more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), much-needed 155mm artillery rounds, Stingers, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles, and other varieties of munitions as well as protected vehicles, spare parts, and night vision devices, according to the statement.\n\nReuters first reported the package would contain Stinger surface-to-air missiles, 155mm shells, anti-tank guided missiles, and armored vehicles.\n\nAdministration officials hinted to CNN the package would also include long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), but they were not listed in the Pentagon's description of the package.\n\nThe U.S. quietly shipped ATACMS to Ukraine in a package cobbled together from cost savings from previous Army contracts and announced on March 12, and Ukraine has used them for the first time, Reuters later reported, citing U.S. officials.\n\nA shorter-range version of the system appeared on the Ukrainian battlefield in October, revealing the Pentagon had conducted a secretive transfer earlier that fall. The Biden administration has resisted sending the longer-range version over concerns it could inflame tensions with Russia and provoke aggression against NATO.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs ATACMS to attack deep behind Russian lines, according to The New York Times.\n\nU.S. officials believe Ukraine's hope of a military victory against Russia is dwindling, and Kyiv could face defeat by the end of the year if its backers do not surge much-needed equipment.\n\nEven when the new tranche is approved, concerns remain regarding how quickly the equipment will actually reach the battlefield, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said on Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian politicians and battlefield commanders paint a picture of increasingly dire conditions, with soldiers forced to ration ammunition and give way to Russia's overpowering advance.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Even with a burst of new weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely Ukraine will immediately recover after months of setbacks.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The package includes air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time began using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday.\n\nBiden approved delivery of the long-range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in February, and then in March the U.S. included a \"significant\" number of them in a $300 million aid package announced, one official said.\n\nTucked into the new aid measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.\n\nThe package also includes about $26 billion in aid for Israel and a surge of about $1 billion in humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags

passed with bipartisan support on a 79-18 vote - which also contains a measure to ban TikTok in the United States if the social media app fails to cut ties with its Chinese parent company.\n\nThe United States hopes that the foreign aid package will bolster international alliances, fortify defense capabilities and extend humanitarian assistance to regions grappling with conflict and crisis.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has promised to sign the package Wednesday, and said in a statement shortly after the vote: 'I will sign this bill into law and address the American people as soon as it reaches my desk tomorrow so we can begin sending weapons and equipment to Ukraine this week.'\n\nAt the forefront of the package is a strategic allocation of military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, signaling unwavering support for key allies amid geopolitical tensions -

Then we will replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America. Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In other words, we are helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security and supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" the president said.\n\nSecretary of State Tony Blinken announced a new package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. \"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are sending a powerful message today about the power of American leadership as we support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression. The United States will continue to work with the coalition of more than 50 countries we have assembled to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon said this package will surge munitions, weapons and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden warned that if Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. \"You all know full well that invoking article five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one as an attack on all. If Putin attacks a NATO ally like he is attacking Ukraine today, we would have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 (2001) attacks here,\" he said.\n\n\"That is why we are supporting and surging support now to Ukraine to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future. You know, it seems to me, we should take a little bit of a step back and realise what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview to Fox News, thanked the US for this aid amounting to USD 61 billion. \"The moment when we waited for this six-month decision, 61 billion hopes. So I am thankful to the people of America, what I wanted to say. I am thankful, not the first time. And I hope that you and the Americans will feel the result of their help, a resolve to save Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he said.

As I've argued for months, this is directly in America's national security interests.\"\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. commander in chief said air defense and rocket systems, as well as armored vehicles made in America, would be in the first tranche of combat equipment sent under the bipartisan supplemental package.\n\nBiden signed the measure, which he requested last fall, after it passed the Senate Tuesday night in a 79-18 vote. It passed the House Saturday as four different measures, with a floor rule bringing them together as one package, as designed by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. and blessed by Biden.\n\nAs Biden took a victory lap in the White House's Indian Treaty Room during an event that was quickly arranged, Republicans were still smarting from divisions the measure caused in their ranks.\n\nUnlike an earlier version of the measure the Senate passed in February, the revised package won support from a majority of Senate Republicans. A slim majority of House Republicans, however, still opposed the final package.\n\nBiden said the measure had a more \"difficult path than it should have\" to get to his desk, but he applauded lawmakers because \"we came together and got it done.\"\n\n\"Now we need to move fast,\" he said about turning the monies supplied by the emergency spending measure into combat shipments. \"And we are.\"\n\nThe president also warned that China, Iran, North Korea and other countries are providing Russian forces with new weapons. \"Meanwhile, Putin's friends have kept him well-supplied. With all that support, Russia has stepped up its airstrikes,\" he warned.\n\nBiden also touted the military aid the measure will send to Israel, and humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians inside the war-torn Gaza strip.\n\nThe U.S. has always \"made sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and the terrorists it supports,\" Biden said, touting $1 billion the measure will provide for \"food, medical supplies, clean water\" in Gaza. He added, \"Israel must make sure all of this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza -- without delay.\"\n\nBiden also applauded congressional leadership for negotiating the substance of a measure.\n\n\"They don't always get along,\" he said. \"But when you look over the past few years, we've seen time and again on critical issues, we've actually come together. ... That's exactly what will continue.\"\n\nBiden has been in full campaign mode this spring, with two more days on the trail planned this week. Despite his celebratory tone on Wednesday, the national security spending measure is not that popular with voters.\n\n\"Just over 4 in 10 (43 percent) of Americans are in favor of the recently passed bills to provide aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, while 35 percent are opposed,\" according to a Monmouth University Polling Institute summary of a survey of adults nationwide conducted April 18-22. \"Another 21 percent have no opinion. Democrats broadly support the foreign aid package (65 percent favor and 14 percent oppose), while Republicans (30 percent favor and 44 percent oppose) and independents (36 percent favor and 45 percent oppose) are somewhat more likely to be against than for the deal.\"\n\n\"The foreign aid package may be a big policy win, but politically it's a wash for Speaker Johnson,\" Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth institute said in the summary.\n\nPentagon details shipments\n\nIn the minutes after Biden announced he signed the bill, the Pentagon unveiled a $1 billion aid package for Ukraine, supplying the country with much-needed air defense systems, artillery rounds and anti-tank weapons.\n\nThat includes 155mm artillery rounds, including dual-purpose improved conventional munitions, or DPICMs; 60mm mortar rounds; additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems; Bradley Fighting Vehicles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; precision aerial munitions; and more.\n\nThe capabilities, which will be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent abroad, represent the first tranche of military support for Kyiv since mid-March, when Defense Department officials cobbled together savings from a number of previous Army contracts to cover a $300 million shipment of equipment.\n\nBut the Pentagon's ability to support Ukraine further had been hampered since December by the lack of funds to backfill U.S. military inventories. Though some $4 billion had remained in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine, officials were reluctant to tap into that authority without additional replenishment funds, or money that's used to buy back capabilities sent overseas.\n\nThat changed with the signing of the supplemental bill, which allocates $23.2 billion to replenish U.S. defense articles and defense services provided to Ukraine, $11.3 billion for current U.S. military operations in that region and $13.8 billion for the procurement of still more weapons and services.\n\nBriana Reilly and David Lerman contributed to

He received artillery shells and ballistic missiles from North Korea. As he signed the National Security Supplemental USD 95.3 billion aid package to Ukraine and Israel and to strengthen the security of America and its allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, Biden stated, \"China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defence production.\"\n\nWith all of this backing, Russia has increased the number of airstrikes it has carried out on Ukrainian cities and vital infrastructure, and it has showered weapons on the valiant Ukrainians who are defending their country. And now, America will provide Ukraine with the supplies it needs to continue fighting,\" stated Biden.\n\nA few hours later, the US began airlifting and shipping artillery, rocket systems, armoured vehicles, and air defence munitions to Ukraine. \"This package is literally an investment not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security,\" Biden stated.\n\n\"We are shipping equipment from our own inventories to Ukraine. Next, we'll add fresh goods produced domestically by American businesses to those stockpiles.\n\n\"Artillery shells produced in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas; Patriot missiles manufactured in Arizona; Javelins manufactured in Alabama. Put another way, we are assisting Ukraine while also bolstering our own industrial base, enhancing national security, and sustaining employment in close to 40 states across the United States,\" the president stated.\n\nTony Blinken, the secretary of state, unveiled a fresh supply of arms and gear for Ukraine. \"This package, which is valued at up to USD 1 billion, includes urgently-needed capabilities, including air defence missiles, munitions for HIMARS, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, precision aerial munitions, anti-armour weapons, and small arms, equipment and spare parts to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,\" he stated.\n\n\"By supporting Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression, we are sending a strong message about the strength of American leadership today. In order to give Ukraine's forces vital support, the United States will keep collaborating with the coalition of more than 50 nations that we have brought together, Blinken stated in a statement.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, this package will push more munitions, weaponry, and equipment forward to help Ukraine defend its cities, its front lines, and it will fend off ongoing Russian attacks.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support -- together with some 50 allies and partners -- to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the Pentagon said.\n\nBiden issued a warning, stating that if Putin wins in Ukraine, there's a good chance that Russian forces will strike a NATO ally directly. Article five of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one person is an attack on all, is the first thing that would come to mind, as you are all well aware. In the same way that our NATO allies rescued us following the September 11 attacks here in 2001, we would be forced to defend them if Putin attacked a NATO ally the way he is attacking Ukraine today,\" the speaker said.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

But Kyiv still faces a daunting battle this year to achieve critical war aims.\n\nThe immediate effect of the U.S. package will be to help defend Ukrainian cities and defensive positions on the front lines, as artillery and air defenses have dwindled since the last U.S. shipments in December. The Biden administration is readying 155 mm artillery shells, air defense munitions and anti-tank munitions in an initial $1 billion package, according to Reuters.\n\nBut more ambitious goals, such as retaking territory in a renewed counteroffensive against entrenched Russian forces, may not happen this year, analysts say.\n\nBecca Wasser, a senior fellow for the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, said the incoming aid package is significant but will not \"magically solve all of Ukraine's problems,\" especially because additional timely U.S. assistance is not guaranteed.\n\n\"There's a choice that Ukrainian leaders need to make, which is: Are they going to try and break some of the deadlock and push for an offensive, or are they going to focus on holding the lines that they currently have?\" she said, noting a counteroffensive could consume resources fast.\n\n\"Considering ways in which they can leverage the current aid package and those also provided by European partners to last longer I think is probably a sound way forward,\" she added.\n\nKyiv breathed a sigh of relief after the House passed the aid over the weekend following months of delays. Russian forces have been taking advantage of the delay on the battlefield, making incremental gains across the 600-mile eastern front and putting Ukrainian troops on the back foot.\n\nThe $95 billion U.S. package, which will also fund Israel, Taiwan and other allies, cleared the Senate on Tuesday night and is expected to be swiftly signed into law by President Biden, whose administration has signaled it can move within days on getting Ukraine weapons, some of which are already in Europe.\n\nFor Ukraine's security needs, the package passed by the House includes more than $23 billion to replenish U.S. weapons stocks, which will allow Washington to send existing supplies.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address Sunday that advisers were working to ensure the package will deliver \"exactly what our warriors at the front are waiting for.\"\n\n\"This strength must be the one capable of truly changing the situation on the front lines,\" he said. \"Front-line air defense is just as important as protection for our cities and villages. Our long-range capabilities, artillery, and ability to expand our area of control are all important.\"\n\nZelensky added in a Monday video that he had spoken with Biden and was seeking three critical priorities: air defense munitions, long-range strike capabilities and artillery. He said Ukraine would for the first time receive the best versions of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which can strike targets up to 190 miles away.\n\nThe aid will certainly give Ukraine a desperately needed boost on the battlefield. The last available U.S. funds dried up at the end of 2023. Russian forces used the opportunity to pummel Ukrainian cities -- exhausting their air defense munitions -- and push ahead on the battlefield.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns warned last week that without more aid, Ukraine was facing a potential defeat by the end of the year.\n\nRussian forces took the city of Avdiivka in February and are inching toward seizing the town of Chasiv Yar, a strategic point because it could pave the way for more gains in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nJohn Hardie, deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said in a Monday press call that Chasiv Yar is \"militarily important as a door to other nearby cities\" and could give Russian forces a high ground for artillery.\n\nHardie explained Ukrainian units are struggling with a shortage of men and ammunition, and the problem has become particularly acute with a lack of 155 mm artillery shells.\n\n\"This U.S. aid is really coming in the nick of time, at a moment when Ukraine is starting to crack on the battlefield a little bit,\" he said. \"And I think they really need U.S. supplies, especially to backfill artillery units.\"\n\nBradley Bowman, senior director of the FDD's Center on Military and Political Power, added in the call that the delay of U.S. aid \"has been costly on the battlefield.\"\n\n\"We've seen the unnecessary loss of Ukrainian lives,\" he said.\n\nRussia is trying to hurt Ukraine as much as possible before more weapons arrive.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said in a Monday assessment that Russian forces are likely using the \"brief window\" before U.S. aid arrives to strike at Kharkiv, a city Moscow appears to have set its eyes on.\n\nRussia is also pushing northwest of Avdiivka, but more U.S. aid is likely to blunt the impact of Russian movement there and toward Kharkiv, researchers assessed.\n\nStill, Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, told BBC last week that Russian forces could create a major problem for Ukraine in mid-May to early June.\n\n\"A rather difficult situation awaits us in the near future,\" he said. \"But it is not catastrophic.\"\n\nWhile stabilizing the front is an important goal, Ukraine's ultimate objective is to retake eastern Ukraine from Russia, an effort that failed last year when Kyiv launched a highly anticipated summer counteroffensive that could not get past Russian lines.\n\nWith more aid, Ukraine may be able to start preparing for another counteroffensive but is unlikely to be in a position to launch one this year, experts say.\n\nAnalysts say Ukraine should work on holding the lines and preparing for a counteroffensive next year, including through training and mobilizing desperately needed forces. Ukraine has been unwilling to enforce a mass mobilization of some 500,000 troops, likely because of the unpopularity of such a move.\n\nBowman, from FDD, said Ukraine should focus on \"avoiding the loss of major cities\" this year.\n\n\"I really view this [current package] as stopping the momentum of Russian tactical offenses this year, and then building some of the momentum for offensive operations next year,\" he said. \"I will be shocked if Ukraine has the ability to put together any sort of operational, strategic-level offensive this year.\"\n\nWhile Congress finally moved to pass Ukraine more aid, a majority of House Republicans voted against the bill, foreshadowing the uphill battle facing future Ukraine aid packages. The lift could become even heavier depending on how U.S. presidential and congressional elections turn out this year.\n\nGrant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University, said that besides the far-right lawmakers in the House who unequivocally oppose funding Ukraine, other Republicans who voted against the last bill are more persuadable on the issue.\n\n\"There's a space to be persuaded that it's in our best interest to do this,\" he said. \"I don't see us abandoning Ukraine and just walking away.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) changed his tune on the issue, at first demanding Ukraine aid be tied to securing the U.S.-Mexico border before moving the package for Kyiv last week despite threats from the far right to remove him. Johnson said he heeded the intelligence briefings about the threat from Russia.\n\n\"I don't think he wanted to be the leader of a Congress that did not provide aid when it was needed,\" Reeher said of Johnson. \"Both for reasons of history and what his legacy will be and also, just the politics of this [because ...] it wouldn't reflect well.\"\n\nBrock Bierman, a visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said the new package will likely get Ukraine through the remainder of the year. If the Ukrainians continue to struggle on the battlefield, he said that could further complicate the debate on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"The Ukrainians showing that they have the ability to create victory and take back parts of Ukraine that had been recaptured or even occupied by the Russians, is going to be an important ingredient to why the Congress supports Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nBut Bierman said the majority of Americans support Kyiv and understand the importance of defending a sovereign nation and democracy. \"I think at the end of the day, we will continue to support Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Georgian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Front (World War II)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avdiivka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avdiivka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Avdiivka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasiv_Yar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chasiv Yar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chasiv Yar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress..\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep U.S. data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden underscored that the bill also includes a surge of humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nRussia now appears focused on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nTwo

CQ Brown, Jr., said today.\n\nSpeaking after President Joe Biden signed the national security supplemental budget request into law, Brown said the Pentagon has continued to lean forward as the $95 billion measure made its way through Congress.\n\n\"What we do in the Department of Defense is plan,\" Brown said during a keynote discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Global Security Forum in Washington. \"And we plan a lot.\"\n\nHe added that the Pentagon is \"well postured with the authorities\" needed to quickly provide Ukraine with munitions.\n\n\"We're moving out,\" he said. \"We'll get capability to Ukraine as quickly as possible.\"\n\nBiden requested the additional funding in October. The House passed the measure over the weekend, and it cleared the Senate on Tuesday.\n\nThe final bill includes $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine, as the country continues to defend against Russia's ongoing invasion. It also includes urgent assistance for Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas terrorists, along with humanitarian support for Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and support for key regional partners in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIn remarks at the White House before he signed the measure into law earlier today, Biden announced that the U.S. would send a fresh round of military aid to Ukraine within hours.\n\nThe Pentagon announced its first assistance package under the new funding soon afterward. The package, which is valued at up to $1 billion, includes key capabilities to include air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and antitank weapons.\n\nThe announcement marks the 56th drawdown of military equipment from DOD inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.\n\nBrown underscored the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the assistance it needs to defend itself against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"Think about what Ukraine has been able to do when they've been resourced,\" he said. \"Early in the conflict, they were able to take back 50% of the territory that they lost after Russia's initial invasion [despite being] against a much more capable force.\"\n\nHe added that Ukraine's success is critical for global stability.\n\n\"What happens in one part of the world doesn't stay in one part of the world,\" he said. \"We've seen that via history, and I think what we're collectively doing in support of Ukraine is important.\"", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Department of Defense"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Q._Brown_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Q.

Biden said he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine, and that the flow of the arms would start within hours.\n\nThe aid package includes Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be sent to the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday.\n\nBiden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation.\n\nJohnson's support for the bill, however, put him on shaky standing with the right wing of the GOP, with some members backing a motion to vacate his speakership.\n\nBiden also blamed \"MAGA Republicans\" loyal to former president Donald Trump for blocking the aid for months, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nThe president also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short-video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe social media platform is particularly popular with young Americans, and TikTok says it has 170 million users in the U.S..\n\nTrump, Biden's presumptive election opponent in November, supported a sale or ban of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by the courts. Trump has opposed the recent move to ban the app, saying Biden supported the ban \"to help his friends over at Facebook become richer and more dominant\".\n\n\"Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,\" Trump said on his Truth Social. \"There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.\"\n\nThe additional aid for Israel also comes as American college campuses are seeing increasing pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson went to the Columbia University campus in New York on Wednesday to support Jewish students after calling for university President Minouche Shafik to resign. He said he met briefly with Shafik and asked her to take more action against the protesters. Johnson's remarks outdoors were met with persistent boos and chants.\n\nCongress' stalemate on the Ukraine aid bill ended when the Republican-controlled House abruptly changed course and approved four bills on Saturday by a vote of 316-94, with 21 House members not voting.\n\nMany members of the House waved small Ukrainian flags when the Ukraine aid passed, a video on X showed.\n\n\"Ukrainian flags fly in the chamber of the UNITED STATES House of Representatives as they vote to send more of your hard-earned money to a corrupt foreign regime,\" Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, posted on X on April 20.\n\nThe U.S. Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, approving the package by a vote of 79-18. Three Republican senators -- Rand Paul, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama -- didn't vote.\n\nDavid Stockman, a former U.S. congressman who was the director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, called the aid package the \"final straw\".\n\n\"The dreadful grip of the UniParty (Democrats and Republicans) on national security policy has finally produced sheer madness in a single package,\" Stockman wrote on antiwar.com.\n\n\"It is bad enough that there is not an iota of informed consideration behind any of this. But what is really alarming is that every single House Democrat (210) voted in favor of $61 billion for the Ukrainian Demolition Derby.\n\n\"This included a 97-0 vote among so-called Dem 'progressives', who also voted 96-0 in favor of aid to Taiwan -- the purpose of which is surely not a more pacific neighborhood on the Pacific Rim,\" he wrote. \"Once upon a time, the Democrats were the party of the peace candidates.\n\n\"At the same time, only 14 Republicans voted against all four components of this wholesale assault on constitutional liberty and fiscal rectitude. As we have previously documented, America is now careening on fiscal automatic pilot toward a $140 trillion public debt by mid-century.\"\n\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said of the Ukraine aid in a recent interview: \"The U.S. debt goes up by another $61 billion, which is a lot of money for Americans that need the money. And nothing helps Ukraine right now. All it does is prolong the dying. It prolongs the destruction.\"\n\nU.S. Representative Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican, posted on X: \"Government has sent billions to Ukraine while completely neglecting the historic nat-sec crisis at OUR border.\"\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll found that only 4 in 10 Americans are in favor of the recently passed bills to provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with 35 percent opposed. The nationwide poll was conducted April 18-22.\n\n\"The foreign aid package may be a big policy win, but politically it's a wash for Speaker Johnson,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.", "source": {"uri": "ecns.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News \u4e2d\u56fd\u65b0\u95fb\u7f51"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNebraska volleyball coach John Cook gives update on Harper Murray First fully completed casino in Nebraska set to open in Columbus on May 13 Painted Tree store -- with as many as 250 vendors -- coming to SouthPointe Downtown Lincoln rooftop bar set to open in time for Huskers Spring Game Former Nebraska basketball coach denies sexual relationship with player Husker notes: Matt Rhule's standout Nebraska RB, most improved player and top two corners Why defensive coordinator Tony White apologized to the Nebraska defense after a scrimmage Felon voting rights bill becomes law in Nebraska without governor's signature It's 'The Voice' playoff time Monday for Lincoln singer Bryan Olesen Nebraska Gov.

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Pentagon hailed Congress' \"bipartisan\" support of Ukraine after the Senate late Tuesday passed a $95 billion foreign aid supplemental by a vote of 79 to 18, sending it to Biden's desk.\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities, and counter Russia's continued attacks,\" the statement read.\n\nThe bill authorized up to $60.8 billion in security assitance for Ukraine, $15 billion in weapons and $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Israel and $8 billion for Taiwan, among other provisions.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute U.S. leadership to provide consistent security assistance support - together with some 50 Allies and partners - to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the statement read.\n\nBiden used Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to authorize the package, meaning the Pentagon will pull equipment from existing U.S. stockpiles, according to the DOD.\n\nThe package includes more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), much-needed 155mm artillery rounds, Stingers, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles and other varieties of munitions as well as protected vehicles, spare parts and night vision devices, according to the statement.\n\nReuters first reported the package would contain Stinger surface-to-air missiles, 155mm shells, anti-tank guided missiles and armored vehicles.\n\nAdministration officials hinted to CNN the package would also include long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), but they were not listed in the Pentagon's description of the package.\n\nA shorter-range version of the system appeared on the Ukrainian battlefield in October, revealing the Pentagon had conducted a secretive transfer earlier that fall. The Biden administration has resisted sending the longer-range version over concerns it could inflame tensions with Russia and provoke aggression against NATO.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs ATACMS to attack deep behind Russian lines, according to The New York Times.\n\nU.S. officials believe Ukraine's hope of a military victory against Russia is dwindling, and Kyiv could face defeat by the end of the year if its backers do not surge much-needed equipment.\n\nEven when the new tranche is approved, concerns remain regarding how quickly the

Biden said he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine, and that the flow of the arms would start within hours.\n\nThe aid package includes Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be sent to the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials confirmed Wednesday.\n\nBiden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation.\n\nJohnson's support for the bill, however, put him on shaky standing with the right wing of the GOP, with some members backing a motion to vacate his speakership.\n\nBiden also blamed \"MAGA Republicans\" loyal to former president Donald Trump for blocking the aid for months, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nThe president also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short-video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe social media platform is particularly popular with young Americans, and TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US.\n\nTrump, Biden's presumptive election opponent in November, supported a sale or ban of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by the courts. Trump has opposed the recent move to ban the app, saying Biden supported the ban \"to help his friends over at Facebook become richer and more dominant\".\n\n\"Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,\" Trump said on his Truth Social. \"There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.\"\n\nThe additional aid for Israel also comes as American college campuses are seeing increasing pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson went to the Columbia University campus in New York on Wednesday to support Jewish students after calling for university President Minouche Shafik to resign. He said he met briefly with Shafik and asked her to take more action against the protesters. Johnson's remarks outdoors were met with persistent boos and chants.\n\nCongress' stalemate on the Ukraine aid bill ended when the Republican-controlled House abruptly changed course and approved four bills on Saturday by a vote of 316-94, with 21 House members not voting.\n\nMany members of the House waved small Ukrainian flags when the Ukraine aid passed, a video on X showed.\n\n\"Ukrainian flags fly in the chamber of the UNITED STATES House of Representatives as they vote to send more of your hard-earned money to a corrupt foreign regime,\" Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, posted on X on April 20.\n\nThe US Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, approving the package by a vote of 79-18. Three Republican senators -- Rand Paul, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama -- didn't vote.\n\nDavid Stockman, a former US congressman who was the director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, called the aid package the \"final straw\".\n\n\"The dreadful grip of the UniParty (Democrats and Republicans) on national security policy has finally produced sheer madness in a single package,\" Stockman wrote on antiwar.com.\n\n\"It is bad enough that there is not an iota of informed consideration behind any of this. But what is really alarming is that every single House Democrat (210) voted in favor of $61 billion for the Ukrainian Demolition Derby.\n\n\"This included a 97-0 vote among so-called Dem 'progressives', who also voted 96-0 in favor of aid to Taiwan -- the purpose of which is surely not a more pacific neighborhood on the Pacific Rim,\" he wrote. \"Once upon a time, the Democrats were the party of the peace candidates.\n\n\"At the same time, only 14 Republicans voted against all four components of this wholesale assault on constitutional liberty and fiscal rectitude. As we have previously documented, America is now careening on fiscal automatic pilot toward a $140 trillion public debt by mid-century.\"\n\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said of the Ukraine aid in a recent interview: \"The US debt goes up by another $61 billion, which is a lot of money for Americans that need the money. And nothing helps Ukraine right now. All it does is prolong the dying. It prolongs the destruction.\"\n\nUS Representative Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican, posted on X: \"Government has sent billions to Ukraine while completely neglecting the historic nat-sec crisis at OUR border.\"\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll found that only 4 in 10 Americans are in favor of the recently passed bills to provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with 35 percent opposed. The nationwide poll was conducted April 18-22.\n\n\"The foreign aid package may be a big policy win, but politically it's a wash for Speaker Johnson,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.", "source": {"uri": "global.chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "global.chinadaily.com.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

US Senate is to take up the measure on Tuesday\n\nUS President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday the US will send badly needed air defence weaponry once the Senate approves a massive national security aid package that includes US$61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nZelensky thanked Biden for unblocking the military aid, speaking in a phone call in which the two leaders discussed the latest attacks including the toppling of a major television tower in the war-battered city of Kharkiv.\n\nZelensky said in a posting on X that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would also include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nUkraine is awaiting US Senate approval after the House this weekend approved the US$95 billion package that also includes aid for other allies. It comes after months of delay as some Republican lawmakers opposed further funding for Ukraine and threatened to oust Speaker Mike Johnson if he allowed a vote to take place.\n\nThe Democratically controlled Senate is to take up the measure on Tuesday and Biden promised to sign the law as soon as it was passed.\n\nThe US president underscored America\u2019s \u201clasting commitment\u201d to Ukraine \u201cas it defends its freedom against Russian aggression\u201d, according to the White House.\n\nBiden said the US will \u201cquickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine\u2019s urgent battlefield and air defence needs\u201d.\n\nZelensky said he and Biden also discussed \u201cRussia\u2019s air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\u201d including a strike on the Kharkiv television tower just minutes before they spoke.\n\n\u201cRussia clearly signals its intention to make the city uninhabitable,\u201d Zelensky said\n\nRussia has exploited air defence shortages in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, to pummel the region\u2019s energy infrastructure and harm its 1.3 million residents. Some officials and analysts warn it could be a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for a summer offensive to seize the city.Ukraine, West laud US aid package, as Russia warns of \u2018further ruin\u2019\n\nThe White House in a statement confirmed that Biden told Zelensky his administration will quickly provide aid packages \u201cas soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law\u201d.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden also underscored that the US economic assistance will help maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,\u201d according to the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan delegation of US members of Congress on Monday met Zelensky in Kyiv. The delegation included congressmen Tom Kean Jnr, Nathaniel Moran, Bill Keating and congresswoman Madeleine Deane.\n\nKean told reporters \u201cwe know that the needs of Ukraine are urgent\u201d and

This announcement is the Biden Administration's fifty-sixth tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories to Ukraine since August 2021.\n\n\"This Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package has an estimated value of USD 1 billion and includes capabilities to support Ukraine's most urgent requirements, including air defence interceptors, artillery rounds, armoured vehicles, and anti-tank weapons,\" the release added.\n\nA key part of the new package is 155 mm artillery rounds and other mortar and artillery ammunition, along with RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defence munitions.\n\nThere was some other important ammunition as well which included 50 caliber, Unmanned Aerial Systems, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, etc.\n\nFurther, the release added that \"this package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities, and counter Russia's continued attacks. With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute US leadership to provide consistent security assistance support together with some 50 Allies and partners to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression.\"\n\nFollowing this Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his thanks after the Senate cleared the package Tuesday night.\n\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said, \"President Biden signed into law today the support package approved by Congress, which includes Ukraine aid. We completed this half-year path. Regardless of what anyone says, we are gaining the support we need to continue protecting lives from Russian attacks. Over the past few days, we have already been actively working with our American friends on all levels to include the exact types of weapons that our warriors require in this package. It totals $1 billion and includes exactly what we discussed with President Biden during our call. I am grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans who recognize that we must cut the ground under Putin's feet rather than obeying him, as this is the only way to truly reduce threats to freedom.

One for Ukraine, a second with $26 billion for Israel, a third with $8.12 billion \"to counter communist China\" in the Indo-Pacific and a fourth that includes a potential ban on the social media app TikTok.\n\nThe Ukraine bill also calls for the transfer of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) with a range of up to 190 miles, which Kyiv has pledged not to use inside Russia's territory.\n\nRussia has increased its long-range bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and its cities in recent weeks, ratcheting up the pressure on Kyiv as Moscow's more numerous and better equipped forces slowly advance on the battlefield in the east.\n\nOnce the Ukraine bill is signed, funds to replenish stocks would rebound, alleviating Pentagon concerns that the use of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to aid Ukraine would compromise U.S. military preparedness.\n\nTens of billions of dollars in the bill was earmarked to buy replacements for weapons sent to Ukraine along with transportation and administrative overhead.\n\nThe bill gives the president $8 billion worth of further Presidential Drawdown Authority. This added to the $3.9 billion remaining from previously authorized PDA means Biden can transfer $11.9 billion worth of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.\n\nAs the replenishment funds are deployed, U.S. defense companies would gain more contracts as the Russia-Ukraine war grinds on.\n\nExperts expect a boost in the order backlog of RTX

I am talking about the front in particular,\" he told the BBC's Ukrainian service.\n\nRussia's holiday target\n\nHe said, however, that while the situation would probably worsen, the fighting would not become \"catastrophic\".\n\n\"Armageddon will not happen,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy has warned that Russia would try to score battlefield victories before 9 May 9 - a patriotic Russian holiday celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany - \"regardless of its losses\".\n\nA senior aide to the Ukrainian leader, Mykhailo Podolyak, said that the US package had given the war-exhausted country a morale boost and that he hoped the support would soon bring results on the front.\n\n\"New supplies of ammunition and equipment will enable the armed forces to repel the Russian offensive, and give our allies time to rethink their strategy,\" he said on social media.\n\nUkrainian officials in eastern and southern Ukraine today reported new casualties in Russian attacks.\n\nOne person was killed and one injured in a strike on Kharkiv, while in the southern city of Kherson, officials said Russian shelling wounded two people while the interior ministry said a man was wounded in Selydove, a town in the Donetsk region.\n\nWith reporting from Press Association and \u00a9 AFP 2024\n\nMaking a difference A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday declined to comment on any pre-construction of the package or detail what would be sent first, but said, \"It's a good assumption to expect that [the next package] will include air-defense capabilities, as well as artillery ammunition.\"\n\n\"I don't have anything to announce right now in terms of what that aid could look like. You know, we need to have a law first,\" he said.\n\n\"... [but] anticipating this, we're doing everything we can to lean forward to be able to provide additional security assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible, so much more to follow in the days ahead.\"\n\nSpecifically, those items could include armored vehicles, \"Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield,\" Reuters reported Tuesday, citing two anonymous US officials.\n\nIn response to the expected renewed US aid, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday said Moscow would \"increase the intensity of attacks on logistics centers and storage bases for Western weapons\" in Ukraine, according to the ministry's Telegram channel.\n\nNoting the desperate situation, Ryder said the Pentagon would \"do everything we can to lean forward, employ [our] robust logistics network capability, employ the relationships that we've built with our international allies and partners to get a [package] there quickly.\"\n\n\"Needless to say we understand the importance and the urgency and are doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly,\" he said.\n\nThe aid cannot come soon enough as Ukraine struggles to keep up with Russia's constant barrages amid dwindling supplies, said John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defending Democracries nonpartisan think tank.\n\n\"I would hope that [the Pentagon has] sort of been taking preparatory measures to make the aid start as quick as possible once they get to go ahead,\" he said.\n\nWhile Ryder asserted that the bill must first be signed into law before the Pentagon can begin sending aid, Hardie said the Biden administration \"could go and start today if they wanted to\" since the president has failed to use up all of the previously approved authority to send billions of dollars worth of weapons from US stockpiles.\n\n\"Now that we know there's going to be a supplemental package and it's just a matter of sort of dotting the Is and crossing the Ts, the administration could go ahead and use the leftover $4 billion that they haven't wanted to use because they didn't know if there was going to be a supplemental,\" he said.\n\nStill, it will take time before Ukraine can claw its way back into the position it had before the months-long pause in US aid after its military suffered some territorial losses due to the setbacks it faced without regular US packages to restock artillery and ammunition.\n\nIt's also unclear how much time it will take to reinvigorate the US defense industrial base and boost its rates of production that slowed without continued funding, defense experts have cautioned in recent weeks, to meet Ukraine's needs\n\nBut the US is not alone there, as British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday said the United Kingdom would put its \"own defense industry on a war footing\" to ensure it can provide Ukraine with enough weapons and equipment to defend itself.\n\n\"One of the central lessons of the war in Ukraine is that we need deeper stockpiles of munitions and for industry to be able to replenish them more quickly,\" Sunak said at a press conference in Poland alongside.\n\nMeanwhile, Shoigu told his staff Tuesday that Moscow would also \"increase the production of the most in-demand weapons and military equipment\" in response to the West stepping up its support, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Telegram.", "source": {"uri":

stem the tide of Russia's assaults.\"\n\nKean said Biden should use the authority in the bill to quickly deliver to Ukraine the weapons that it has requested, including the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS.\n\nZelensky said that he discussed with the U.S. lawmakers Ukraine's need for artillery shells, long-range missiles, electronic warfare equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aviation and support in developing the Ukrainian defense industry.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraine's bid to eventually join NATO, U.S. participation in an international conference in

The Pentagon hailed Congress' \"bipartisan\" support of Ukraine after the Senate late Tuesday passed a $95 billion foreign aid supplemental by a vote of 79 to 18, sending it to Biden's desk.\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities, and counter Russia's continued attacks,\" the statement read. (RELATED: US Hands Over Seized Iranian Guns And Ammo To Ukraine)\n\nThe bill authorized up to $60.8 billion in security assitance for Ukraine, $15 billion in weapons and $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Israel and $8 billion for Taiwan, among other provisions.\n\n\"With the bipartisan support of Congress, Ukraine can count on strong and resolute U.S. leadership to provide consistent security assistance support - together with some 50 Allies and partners - to ensure its brave defenders receive the critical capabilities needed to fight Russian aggression,\" the statement read.\n\nBiden used Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to authorize the package, meaning the Pentagon will pull equipment from existing U.S. stockpiles, according to the DOD.\n\nThe package includes more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), much-needed 155mm artillery rounds, Stingers, RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles and other varieties of munitions as well as protected vehicles, spare parts and night vision devices, according to the statement.\n\nReuters first reported the package would contain Stinger surface-to-air missiles, 155mm shells, anti-tank guided missiles and armored vehicles.\n\nAdministration officials hinted to CNN the package would also include long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), but they were not listed in the Pentagon's description of the package.\n\nA shorter-range version of the system appeared on the Ukrainian battlefield in October, revealing the Pentagon had conducted a secretive transfer earlier that fall. The Biden administration has resisted sending the longer-range version over concerns it could inflame tensions with Russia and provoke aggression against NATO.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs ATACMS to attack deep behind Russian lines, according to The New York Times.\n\nU.S. officials believe Ukraine's hope of a military victory against Russia is dwindling, and Kyiv could face defeat by the end of the year if its backers do not surge much-needed equipment.\n\nEven when the new tranche is approved, concerns remain regarding how quickly the equipment will actually reach the battlefield, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said on Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian politicians and battlefield commanders paint a picture of increasingly dire conditions, with soldiers forced to ration ammunition and give way to Russia's overpowering advance.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But Johnson defied the his party's rebels at the weekend, and their effort to remove him has sputtered.\n\nBiden said the bill's passage -- despite months of delay -- was a sign that a political consensus on America's national security interests was still in place.\n\n\"We don't walk away from our allies, we stand with them,\" Biden said. \"We don't let tyrants win, we oppose them. We don't merely watch global events unfold, we shape them.\"\n\nBiden added: \"That's what it means to be the 'indispensable nation'. That's what it means to be the world's superpower and the world's leading democracy.\"\n\nThe new aid package from the Pentagon includes Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, 155mm artillery rounds, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, TOW missiles, Javelins and other weapons and ammunition, according to the Pentagon.\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its front lines, protect its cities and counter Russia's continued attacks,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\n\nThe rest of the $95bn in aid is earmarked for Israel and Taiwan. The legislation also includes a provision that requires the Chinese group ByteDance, the parent of TikTok, to divest the popular video app.\n\nTikTok said it would file a legal challenge against what it described as an \"unconstitutional law\" that amounted to a \"ban\" that would \"devastate 7mn businesses and silence 170mn Americans\".\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail. The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep US data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation,\" TikTok said.\n\nBiden and his most senior aides have been sounding increasingly dire warnings about the implications of the failure to aid Ukraine, with the lapse in funding so far this year already leading to setbacks on the battlefield.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden said the transatlantic alliance was at stake and warned that a Russian victory in Ukraine was likely to lead to a direct attack on Nato allies.\n\n\"Had we failed to step up, Lord only knows what would happen to the cohesion of Nato,\" Biden said. He added that if Russian leader Vladimir Putin \"triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a Nato ally\" and the US would \"have no choice but to come to their aid\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

In the next few hours we are going to begin sending equipment to Ukraine, for air defence munitions, for artillery, for rocket systems and armoured vehicles.\"\n\nThe bill includes $61 billion in aid to Ukraine and $26 billion for Israel, as well as $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza and $8 billion to counter China's military might.

But a better strategy is urgently needed", "body": "Open Society University Network Academy Fellow, Ukraine Forum, Russia and Eurasia Programme\n\nThe new $61 billion US aid package for Ukraine, approved by Congress on 23 April, will improve Ukraine's battlefield position - allowing stocks of ammunition from US bases in Poland and Germany to be shipped quickly to existing Ukrainian forces, and newly mobilized troops to be equipped.\n\nCritics of Ukraine's mobilization law, recently passed by the parliament in Kyiv, argued it made little sense to draft more men if there were no weapons to arm them: now that concern can be discarded.\n\nThe US package includes weapons Ukraine has long sought and which can make a significant difference in the war, like long-range ATACMS missiles. These will improve Ukraine's capability to threaten and destroy Russian military targets in occupied Crimea, forcing Russia to withdraw its equipment and enhancing Black Sea security.\n\nThe US vote also provides an important boost to morale in Ukraine, restoring hope that Western partners are delivering on their promises and sending a powerful signal to Russia. Ukrainian soldiers have sent messages from the trenches, thanking the American people; MPs displayed American flags in Ukraine's parliament.\n\nImpact on the battlefield\n\nIn the short term, however, the battlefield situation will remain difficult.\n\nUkraine's defence intelligence chief has already warned that Russia might attempt a new offensive in May. Meanwhile Russian forces have already captured around 360 sq km of territory this year, according to the Institute of the Study of War, enabled by Ukraine's shortage of ammunition.\n\nNow the Russian military is pushing to seize the town of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region, hoping to take it before Moscow's Victory day parade on 9 May.\n\nIf captured, this would open the way for an advance to Ukraine's Donbas strongholds of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, with severe consequences for Ukraine's strategic position.\n\nHomefront and civilian infrastructure\n\nFollowing the vote, Moscow will also likely intensify its drone and missile strikes. These will target Ukraine's logistics routes, infrastructure and defense industrial base, left dangerously exposed in recent weeks by a shortage of air defenses.\n\nRecent Russian attacks have caused huge damage to Ukraine's energy infrastructure and completely destroyed the largest thermal power plant in the Kyiv region, leaving vast parts of the country in blackout.\n\nThe US is reportedly supplying one more Patriot missile defence system to Ukraine as a part of its aid package.\n\nBut that will not be enough to protect Ukraine's sky. Officials in Kyiv said they need seven more Patriots. Germany has committed to sending one, and Spain and Greece are under pressure to transfer their systems to Ukraine.\n\nUntil they arrive, Ukraine will suffer more damage. Kharkiv, a city of 1.3 million people on the Russian border, is under particularly heavy daily bombardment - its mayor saying it was at risk of turning into a 'second Aleppo'.\n\nThe crisis management model and European support\n\nThe six-month delay in provision of the US military aid has therefore had huge repercussions for Ukraine's ability to defend itself, demonstrating that the unstable 'crisis management' model of Western aid actually emboldens Russia to escalate - perceiving Western hesitancy as weakness. It also shows that it is na\u00efve to believe that the frontline in Ukraine can remain stable without a steady flow of Western military assistance.\n\nWithout a better plan for consistent aid delivery, sooner or later Ukraine will again find itself in a critical situation.\n\nIt is a welcome development that the new US bill acknowledges the need for more stable funding and calls for a 'multi-year' strategy with 'specific and achievable objectives' that hasten Ukrainian victory.\n\nHowever, US support should not be overly relied upon. Europe must act too, using the time Ukraine has bought it to get serious about defence.\n\nEuropean countries must follow up the US's significant new commitment by urgently seeking to ramp up domestic ammunition production. It must move faster with the delivery of 1 million artillery shells, promised long ago. And it must finally get serious about increasing military spending budgets.\n\nEuropeans should also transfer more weapons to Ukraine, particularly air defence systems. Ukrainian officials say there are about a hundred Patriot missile defence systems in the world. Kyiv's partners should use their diplomatic and financial heft to secure at least the seven Ukraine has requested.\n\nGermany's Olaf Scholz should also follow the example set by the US provision of ATACMS systems to unblock the delivery of Taurus missiles.\n\nA new funding strategy\n\nMost importantly, the bitter experience with the US military aid package shows that the whole approach to supporting Ukraine must change. The US only approved an aid package after realizing that Ukraine was on the brink of collapse. Many lives could have been saved if it had been released earlier. (At least 604 civilians were killed or injured in Ukraine in March 2024 alone).\n\nA long-term, sustainable strategy that enables an uninterrupted flow of Western military aid, regardless of election cycles and political squabbles, must be developed by the US, Europe and Ukraine's other allies. Vital assistance should never again be a hostage of domestic politics.\n\nThis can be achieved by legislatively committing to funding Ukraine in the long-term. Bilateral security agreements Ukraine has signed with six EU countries and the UK allow for that. More similar agreements, including one with the US, are upcoming.\n\nMoney for this can be found by increasing national defence spending, with governments informing their citizens that supporting Ukraine now prevents much greater future expense - and the need to risk their own servicemen and women's lives.\n\nPopular opinion across the West is mostly supportive of continuing and boosting funding for Ukraine. A recent example in Slovakia, where citizens crowdfunded almost \u20ac3 million for artillery shells, shows that a solution can be found even in countries with reluctant governments.\n\nThere's also the idea of issuing EU bonds to finance efforts to ramp up Europe's defence capabilities, supported by presidents of France and Estonia.", "source": {"uri": "chathamhouse.org", "dataType": "news",

BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It is expected to include air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons to shore up Ukrainian forces who have seen morale sink as Russian President Vladimir Putin has racked up win after win.\n\nBut longer term, it remains uncertain if Ukraine -- after months of losses in Eastern Ukraine and sustaining massive damage to its infrastructure -- can make enough progress to sustain American political support before burning through the latest influx of money.\n\n\"It's not going in the Ukrainians' favor in the Donbas, certainly not elsewhere in the country,\" said White House national security spokesman John Kirby, referring to the eastern industrial heartland where Ukraine has suffered setbacks. \"Mr. Putin thinks he can play for time. So we've got to try to make up some of that time.\"\n\nPolitics Is the US banning TikTok?

Russian forces have exploited air defense shortages in the city,pummeling the region's energy infrastructure, and looking to shape conditions for a potential summer offensive to seize the city.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the challenges we face.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential GOP nominee, has complained that European allies have not done enough for Ukraine. While he stopped short of endorsing the supplemental funding package, his tone has shifted in recent days, acknowledging that Ukraine's survival is important to the United States.\n\nIndeed, many European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. The European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump in a campaign speech warned NATO allies that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that don't meet defense spending goals if he returns to the White House.\n\nIt was a key moment in the debate over Ukraine spending. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting \"American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Biden days later called Trump's comments \"dangerous\" and \"un-American\" and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut in reality, the White House maneuvering to win additional funding for Ukraine started months earlier.\n\nBiden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct. 7 attack on Israel, used a rare prime time address to make his pitch for the supplemental funding.\n\nAt the time, the House was in chaos because the Republican majority had been unable to select a speaker to replace Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who had been ousted more than two weeks earlier. McCarthy's reckoning with the GOP's far right came after he agreed earlier in the year to allow federal spending levels that many in his right flank disagreed with and wanted undone.\n\nFar-right Republicans have also adamantly opposed sending more money for Ukraine, with the war appearing to have no end in sight. Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.\n\nBy late October, Republicans finally settled on Johnson, a low-profile Louisiana Republican whose thinking on Ukraine was opaque, to serve as the next speaker. Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.\n\nIn private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia. Five days after Johnson was formally elected speaker, national security adviser Jake Sullivan outlined to him the administration's strategy on Ukraine and assured him that accountability measures were in place in Ukraine to track where the aid was going -- an effort to address a common complaint from conservatives.\n\nOn explicit orders from Biden himself, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid -- a directive the president repeatedly instilled in his senior staff.\n\nFor his part, Johnson came off to White House officials as direct and an honest actor throughout the negotiations, according to a senior administration official. Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. And he knew there was plenty of Republican support for further Ukraine funding.\n\nAt frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to \"just keep talking, keep working,\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nSo they did. In a daily meeting convened by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, the president's top aides -- seated around a big oval table in Zients' office -- would brainstorm possible ways to better make the case about Ukraine's dire situation in the absence of aid.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff were in regular contact with Johnson. Goff and Johnson's senior staff also spoke frequently as a deal came into focus.\n\nThe White House also sought to accommodate Johnson and his various asks. For instance, administration officials at the speaker's request briefed Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. -- two conservatives who were persistent antagonists of Johnson.\n\nAll the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's instincts to resist pressuring Johnson proved correct.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a very good sense of when to heavily intervene and when to try to shape things,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn public, the administration deployed a strategy of downgrading intelligence that demonstrated Russia's efforts to tighten its ties with U.S. adversaries China, North Korea and Iran to fortify Moscow's defense industrial complex and get around U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nFor example, U.S. officials this month laid out intelligence findings that showed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry. Earlier, the White House publicized intelligence that Russia has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and has acquired attack drones from Iran.\n\nThe $61 billion can help triage Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv will need much more for a fight that could last years, military experts say.\n\nRealistic goals for the months ahead for Ukraine -- and its allies -- include avoiding the loss of major cities, slowing Russia's momentum and getting additional weaponry to Kyiv that could help them go on the offensive in 2025, said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.\n\n\"In our microwave culture, we tend to want immediate results,\" Bowman said. \"And sometimes things are just hard and you can't get immediate results. I think Ukrainian success is not guaranteed, but Russian success is if we stop supporting Ukraine.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nTwo

The legislation would also force a ban of the social media app TikTok if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, does not divest itself.\n\n\"It's gonna make America safer, it's gonna make the world safer, and it continues America's leadership in the world,\" Biden said during remarks at the White House on Wednesday, hailing it as \"a good day for world peace.\"\n\nThe bill passed the Senate Tuesday night in a 79-18 vote after the House cleared the legislation -- split up into four different bills -- over the weekend. Tuesday night's passage ended months of gridlock in Congress over the foreign aid, as some, particularly in the House GOP's right flank, pushed back on the U.S. providing any additional aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"For months, while MAGA Republicans were blocking aid, Ukraine has been running out of artillery shells and ammunition,\" Biden said on Wednesday. \"Meanwhile, Putin's friends are keeping (him) well supplied -- Iran sending drones; North Korea sending ballistic missiles and artillery shells; China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defense production.\"\n\nFor months, Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned of what they described as dire consequences of abandoning Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. The president had originally requested Congress approve more aid for the country more than six months ago. Its approval on Tuesday marks a major victory for Biden and the Senate leaders.\n\n\"The path to my desk was a difficult path. It should have been easier and it should have gotten there sooner,\" Biden said. \"But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose in the moment, came together, we got it done.\"\n\n\"Now we need to move fast,\" he said.\n\nAlmost immediately after the bill's passage, the Department of Defense on Wednesday announced a $1 billion package for Ukraine containing air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons.\n\n\"I'm making sure the shipments start right away,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden made the case the package is a \"good investment\" in America's own security, noting the weapons going to Ukraine will replaced with weapons made in the U.S.\n\n\"Patriot missiles made in Arizona; javelins made in Alabama; artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas,\" Biden said. \"In other words, we're helping Ukraine while at the same time investing in our own industrial base.\"\n\nThe president thanked congressional leaders for their support, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, a move that led to a handful of right-wing Republicans threatening to unseat him like they previously did to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThe senate vote on the foreign aid package was 79 to 18\n\nWith 15 Republicans, two Democrats, and one Independent voting against the measure.\n\nBoth of Florida's senators were among them, and they listed the same reasons for not joining the 31 Republicans who sided with the majority.\n\n\"While this invasion of Ukraine most certainly poses a national security interest to the united states and a risk to our country, the invasion of America across our southern border is even more important,\" Sen. Marco Rubio said.\n\nSen. Rick Scott posted on X: \"It makes zero sense for the U.S. to borrow billions to send in unaccountable aid to Ukraine to pay Ukrainian politicians' salaries and secure their border while ours remains totally open. Biden's invasion of criminals and terrorists is a national security disaster.\"\n\nIn February, both senators also voted to block bipartisan legislation that would have both boosted border security and provided aid for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nBoth senators disagreed with the deal, saying it did nothing to remove the millions of migrants already here illegally, authorized 250,000 green cards, and expanded humanitarian parole.\n\nScott and Rubio both say the president has the power to secure the border right now by re-instating the Trump-era policies Biden revoked at the beginning of his presidency.\n\nSupreme Court appears skeptical that state abortion bans conflict with federal health care law\n\nConservative Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical Wednesday that state abortion bans taking effect after their sweeping ruling overturning Roe v. Wade violate federal health care law, though some also questioned the effects on emergency pregnancy care.\n\nThe case marks the first time the Supreme Court has considered the implications of a state ban since overturning the nationwide right to abortion. It comes from Idaho, which is among 14 states that now ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with very limited exceptions.\n\nThe high court has already allowed the state ban to go into effect, even in medical emergencies, and it was unclear whether members of the conservative majority were swayed by the Biden administration's argument that federal law overrides the state in rare emergency cases where a pregnant patient's health is at serious risk.\n\nThe Justice Department says abortion care must be allowed in those cases under a law that requires hospitals accepting Medicare to provide emergency care regardless of patients' ability to pay.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, who wrote the decision overturning Roe v. Wade, was doubtful.\n\n\"How can you impose restrictions on what Idaho can criminalize, simply because hospitals in Idaho have chosen to participate in Medicare?\" he said.\n\nJustices on the high court's liberal minority, meanwhile, aired arguments that Idaho's law was putting women's health at risk.\n\n\"Within these rare cases, there's a significant number where the woman's life is not in peril, but she's going to lose her reproductive organs. She's going to lose the ability to have children in the future unless an abortion takes place,\" said Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nThe Biden administration argues that even in states where abortion is banned, federal health care law says hospitals must be allowed to terminate pregnancies in rare emergencies where a patient's life or health is at serious risk.\n\nIdaho contends its ban has exceptions for life-saving abortion, but allowing it in more medical emergencies would turn hospitals into \"abortion enclaves.\" The state argues the Biden administration is misusing a health care law that is meant to ensure patients aren't turned away based on their ability to pay.\n\nThe Supreme Court has allowed the Idaho law to go into effect, even during emergencies, as the case has played out. It makes performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nDueling protests were taking shape outside the court before the start of arguments on Wednesday. \"Abortion saves lives,\" read signs displayed by abortion rights supporters. Opponents displayed a sign that read, \"Emergency rooms are not abortion clinics.\"\n\nDoctors have said Idaho's abortion ban has already affected emergency care. More women whose conditions are typically treated with abortions must now be flown out of state for care, since doctors must wait until they are close to death to provide abortions within the bounds of state law.\n\nMeanwhile, complaints of pregnant women being turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, according to federal documents obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nAnti-abortion groups blame doctors for mishandling maternal emergency cases. Idaho argues the Biden administration overstates health care woes to undermine state abortion laws.\n\nThe justices also heard another abortion case this term, which seeks to restrict access to abortion medication. It remains pending, though the justices overall seemed skeptical of the push.\n\nThe Justice Department originally brought the case against Idaho, arguing the state's abortion law conflicts with the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, known as EMTALA. It requires hospitals that accept Medicare to provide emergency care to any patient regardless of their ability to pay. Nearly all hospitals accept Medicare.\n\nA federal judge initially sided with the administration and ruled that abortions were legal in medical emergencies. After the state appealed, the Supreme Court allowed the law to go fully into effect in January.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of June.\n\nEckerd College students react to President Biden's Tampa visit\n\nEckerd College Political Science Professor Tony Brunello allowed Spectrum News to attend his class on Tuesday which coincided with President Joe Biden's visit to Tampa to highlight his support for abortion rights.\n\n\"How many of you are surprised that President Biden is actually visiting Florida as a campaign stop at this point?\" Brunello asked the class. \"Is he wasting his trip?\"\n\nStudent Madison Gley responded: \"No ... I definitely think it's worth the trip reaching out to those people and getting a face-to-face interaction and him talking about his agenda. So, our citizens can really understand his plan.\"\n\nThree women students, all 20 years old and all independent or no-party-affiliation voters agreed to talk about the abortion issue on the November ballot and Biden's visit.\n\nStudent Erin Flynn said it's important for Biden to visit the Bay area to show his support for abortion rights as Florida's six-week abortion ban goes into effect on May 1.\n\n\"I think Ron DeSantis has kind of dimmed everyone's feelings lately and we're kind of feeling hopeless,\" she said. \"I think with Joe Biden coming, it'll be real good to hear his agenda and for people to think more about it.\"\n\nStudent Noel Huchel Sullender said she plans to vote for Amendment 4 on the November ballot, which would enshrine abortion rights in the Florida Constitution.\n\n\"Sometimes you need that health care. That is, in my opinion, that should be a woman's right,\" she said. \"That is a health care, right? So, I think that is a huge issue.\"\n\nStudent Angela Redman said it's smart for Biden to highlight and contrast his position with former President Donald Trump, whose appointment of three Supreme Court justices overturned federal abortion protections.\n\n\"I think it's really about the intrusion on our privacy and our intrusion on choice,\" she said. \"It's not very fair to think that you are morally correct whilst taking away the choice of others.\"\n\nProfessor Michael Binder, who is director of the public opinion research lab at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, said Republicans have nearly 1 million more registered voters than Democrats. Amendment 4 must get at least 60% of the vote to be approved, and Binder predicted that it will fail.\n\n\"We've seen it pass in red states, but we've never seen it get to 60%. I think that's going to be a much harder one to get across the 60% line,\" he said. \"Not every 21-year-old college student is this big lefty liberal type, right? I have plenty of conservatives in my class that feel differently about these issues than you might expect.\"\n\nBinder said abortion rights are a positive issue for the Democratic ticket and it was a wise move for Biden to visit Tampa to highlight it.\n\nFlynn agreed that it will be difficult to get the proposed amendment over the 60% threshold needed for the amendment to be approved, but said she is hopeful.\n\n\"We have a voice, we have a say,\" she said. \"We are the generation that chooses what happens in our government.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With respect to actual territory, we're talking about tactical losses in the east, not some fundamental structural shift in the underlying dynamic in the conflict,\" Sullivan told reporters at the White House.\n\n\"But you can also measure it just in terms of the the wear and tear in places on a frontline unit who has to ration ammunition, because they're not getting the steady flows,\" he added.\n\nThe package announced Wednesday also includes Bradley fighting vehicles, Humvees, Claymore mines, MRAP vehicles, and Javelin surface-to-air missiles.\n\nWhile Ukraine still seeks other capabilities, such as more Patriot missile batteries, the lower-budget items such as artillery shells and spare parts to get weapons back on the battlefield will be welcomed by Kyiv's forces.\n\nWhen The Post visited Ukrainian troops at the front last month, an infantry unit commander had said the shortage had become so drastic they had rationed their artillery, only firing on the enemy if there was a large group gathered together.\n\n\"Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery, and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post to X. \"I am grateful to all Americans who continue to support Ukraine and recognize that the historical significance of this bill extends beyond politics.\"\n\n\"This vote [to approve the supplemental] reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and the leader of the free world,\" he added.\n\nWednesday marked the 56th tranche of military equipment the Pentagon has sent Ukraine since the fall of 2021, when Russian President Vladimir Putin began preparing for his invasion launched on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nIt typically takes the Pentagon no more than four days to deliver a new weapons package, meaning the equipment could be in Ukrainian hands by Monday.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And it continues America's leadership in the world.\"\n\nBiden said that within hours, the U.S. would begin shipments of air defense munitions, artillery for rocket systems and armored vehicles into Ukraine to help Kyiv's fighters in a war with Moscow that has largely stalemated on the eastern Ukraine battlefront.\n\nHe said the U.S. would ship munitions from its own stockpiles, then replace those with new munitions manufactured in the United States.\n\n\"In other words, we're helping Ukraine while at the same time, investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security, supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,\" Biden said.\n\nHe called congressional passage of the aid bill, approved after months of debate, \"a historical moment,\" showing the U.S. would stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"We stand up against dictators,\" Biden declared. \"We bow to no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nThe Senate late Tuesday completed passage of the new aid bill. The 79-18 vote came after months of delays, chiefly in the House of Representatives, where the legislation stalled in a dispute over sending aid abroad while failing to act on tighter security to curb migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe House ultimately approved the measure by a vote of 311-112 on Saturday. But the measure in the final version does not address the U.S. border migration concerns.\n\nUkraine's battle against a Russian invasion is the major focus of the package, with $61 billion going toward that fight.\n\nThe bill also includes $26 billion for Israel at a time when it is battling Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, and $8 billion for countering China's actions threatening Taiwan and other allies in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging allies to provide more aid to help his military match up against Russia's forces, particularly to defend Ukrainian cities from daily missile and drone attacks.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell following the Senate approval, saying the vote \"reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and the leader of the free world.\"\n\n\"Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nSchumer said late Tuesday the United States will soon deliver ammunition and air defenses to help Ukraine resist Russia, send aid to Israel to fight Hamas and stand up to Iran, deliver food and medicine to civilians in Gaza and help allies resist China.\n\n\"We tell our allies, 'We stand with you.' We tell our adversaries, 'Don't mess with us,'\" Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell told the Senate ahead of the vote that the world was watching to see how lawmakers would act.\n\n'History will record that even as allies and partners may have worried about the depth of our resolve, even as Moscow, Beijing and Tehran grew more convinced that our influence had run its course, and even as loud voices here at home insisted on abandoning the responsibilities of leadership, America stepped up,' McConnell said.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also thanked lawmakers for passing the security aid bill, calling the package \"a clear testament to the strength of our alliance\" and saying it \"sends a strong message to all our enemies.\"\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(KSNT) - With the recent passage of a massive foreign aid bill for Ukraine and other U.S. allies, how did Kansas' representatives and senators vote on the spending bill?\n\nKansas representatives and senators were divided on the disbursement of billions in foreign aid to Ukraine during votes on the issue earlier this month. Their choices can be found below:\n\n\"When the country is more than $34.5 trillion in debt and bad actors threaten the United States' border and our allies across the globe, it's imperative that we make strategic spending choices and respect taxpayer dollars. Some of the most pressing issues facing our nation include securing our southern border, supporting our strongest Middle Eastern ally Israel and countering the Chinese Communist Party in the Indo-Pacific region - today I voted for three critical bills that address these threats. I've previously voted for Russian sanctions as Ukraine faces unprovoked aggression from a tyrant, but the $60.8 billion bill that the House passed today was too much for me to support when the United States has already spent more than $100 billion on Ukraine aid.\"\n\n\"Being the leader of the free world comes with great responsibility - both at home and abroad. It is in America's interest for Ukrainian forces to defeat Russia, but it is irresponsible and unsustainable to continue funding a war in Ukraine without any oversight as to how Americans' tax dollars are spent. I could not in good conscience vote to send $60.84 billion more to Ukraine without proper checks in place for the $75 billion that America has already sent. We do not allow our own federal agencies to spend our tax dollars that way, and we should not allow foreign governments to either. It should not be controversial.\"\n\n\"National security crises abroad and here at home are ever increasing. Iran launched a full-scale attack on Israel; Hamas has stated its intent to wipe Israel off the map; Russia continues its brutal aggression in Ukraine; and China is rapidly modernizing its military and using companies to spy and track Americans. Each of these conflicts are interconnected, and it would be na\u00efve to send aid to Israel but take a pass on supporting Ukraine, Taiwan or our other allies.\n\nIt is vital for the United States to be a steadfast and reliable partner in the midst of so many dangers that threaten the world and our own nation's peace and prosperity. There is no path forward for Ukraine, there is no path forward for Israel or for Taiwan if the United States of America disengages in the world. The price tag is significant, but in the absence of taking a stand now, we have to take a stand tomorrow. Do what we need to do today or pay a price later, and later will be even more costly. In addition, a majority of the funding provided to Ukraine in this package and in previous packages will be directly injected back into the U.S. economy.\"\n\n\"Today, I voted with Republicans and Democrats to protect our allies in Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan in their fights against tyranny and terror and to deliver aid to innocent civilians in Gaza. While I am frustrated that preserving our national security has been marred with partisanship, in times of crisis, we must defend democracy and recognize that stability and prosperity abroad directly impact our safety and economy at home.\"\n\n\"Under the Biden Administration, Venezuelan drug cartels have been given more operational control of our southern border than U.S. Border Patrol agents. More than 11 million illegal aliens, including thousands of Chinese nationals, have been imported into every state in America - and we have absolutely no idea who these people are. Biden's own DHS Secretary testified five days ago that he doesn't know if our security technology at the border is even operational. This is America's most important national security issue, and it isn't even close.\n\nWe cannot continue selling our grandchildren down a river and sending another $60 billion that we do not have to Ukraine - that's on top of the $125 billion we've already sent with no oversight or accountability.\n\nEnough is enough. For me, it will always be America first - our safety, health, and security above all else.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave his approval for the $95 billion foreign aid bill, most of which is slated for Ukraine, on Wednesday, April 24. It passed through the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate at 311-112 and 79-18 respectively.\n\nThe bill has $61 billion earmarked for Ukraine to help the nation continue its ongoing war with Russia. Around $26 billion will be sent to Israel while $8 billion is being sent to other U.S. allies like Taiwan, according to a report from The Associated Press. The bill also allows the U.S. to seize Russian assets in its territory for use in helping Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ksnt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSNT 27"}, "authors": [{"uri":

will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\"\n\nThe president also told Zelensky that economic assistance from the U.S. aims to help Ukraine maintain financial stability, build infrastructure following attacks from Russia and support reform while Ukraine moves toward Euro-Atlantic integration.\n\nThe Senate is widely expected to approve the foreign aid package this week after 22 of 49 Senate Republicans voted for a similar bill when it passed the Senate in February.\n\nAfter months of fighting between the parties, across the chambers and within the House Republican conference, the lower chamber on Saturday approved a massive new round of foreign aid, combining billions of dollars in military help for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan with billions more in humanitarian assistance for Gaza and other war zones around the globe.\n\nAfter the House passed the legislation, Zelensky thanked lawmakers \"for the decision that keeps history on the right track.\"\n\nWhile a victory for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), his decision to champion new foreign aid has come with stark political risks, infuriating conservatives who were already up in arms over his willingness to cut deals with Biden on big-ticket

the Cherkasy, Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Odesa regions.\n\nOleh Kiper, the regional governor of Odesa, said the drone attack damaged several residential buildings and injured at least nine people.\n\nVitaliy

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement. \"If Putin is allowed to succeed in this war of aggression, he will not stop at the Polish border.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed

capabilities.\"\n\n\"Storm Shadow and other missiles, hundreds of armored vehicles and watercraft, ammunition -- all of this is needed on the battlefield,\" Zelenskyy said on social media.\n\nAhead of

infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration.\"\n\nZelenskyy, posting on social media, expressed his appreciation for the aid package and said Biden told him it would include strengthening Ukraine's \"air defense as well as long-range and artillery capabilities.\"\n\nZelenskyy also said he told Biden about the \"Russian air terror using thousands of missiles, drones and bombs\" and added a Russian strike on a television tower in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, occurred minutes before their

Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It passed the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 79-18.\n\nTuesday evening's approval came after the measure passed the US House of Representatives on Saturday.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said: \"After more than six months of hard work and many twists and turns in the road, America sends a message to the entire world: we will not turn our back on you.\"\n\nReacting to the vote, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it \"reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and leader of the free world\".\n\nThe Senate passed a similar aid package in February, but a group of conservatives who oppose new Ukraine support had prevented it from coming to a vote in the House of Representatives.\n\nLast week, Democrats and Republicans in the lower chamber joined together to bypass this opposition.\n\nThey ultimately agreed to a package bill that included the foreign aid as well as legislation to confiscate Russian assets held by Western banks; new sanctions on Russia, Iran and China; and a provision that will force the Chinese company ByteDance to sell the popular social media service TikTok.\n\nIn the House on Saturday, a majority of Republicans in the chamber voted against the foreign aid package.\n\nThe bill also faced resistance among a handful of Senate Republicans who opposed any new aid to Ukraine.\n\nFifteen voted with two Democrats -- as well as independent Senator Bernie Sanders who objected to providing new offensive weapons to Israel -- against the bill.\n\n\"Pouring more money into Ukraine's coffers will only prolong the conflict and lead to more loss of life,\" Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville said in remarks on Tuesday.\n\n\"No-one at the White House, the Pentagon, or the state department can articulate what victory looks like in this fight.\"\n\nThe aid package is expected to provide a significant boost to Ukraine's forces, which have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defense systems in recent months.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, faced the latest in a series of recent drone and missile strikes, with authorities saying two people in a residential neighborhood were injured.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said he was expecting an attempt by Russian forces to advance on the city, which is near the Russian border.\n\nBetween February 2022 and January 2024, the US gave Ukraine more than $40bn in military aid, according to German research organization, the Kiel Institute.\n\nThe foreign aid package passed on Tuesday also allocates $17bn to Israel, as well as $9bn for civilians suffering in conflict zones around the world, including Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nA further $8bn has been earmarked for allies in the Asia-Pacific, including Taiwan, to \"counter communist China\".\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reacted to the vote by thanking congressional leaders for their \"unwavering commitment to Israel's security\".\n\n\"Israel and the United States stand together in the fight against terrorism, defending democracy and our shared values,\" he said.\n\nThe US already provides Israel with $3.8bn in military aid each year.\n\nOver in Asia, a Chinese government spokeswoman called the military aid for Taiwan a \"serious violation of the one-China principle\" that would \"send the wrong signal to the pro-independence separatist forces\" in Taiwan.\n\n\"We urge the US to take practical actions to fulfil its commitment not to support Taiwan independence by not arming Taiwan in any way,\" she said.\n\nTaiwan's incoming President William Lai said the aid package would \"strengthen deterrence against authoritarianism\".\n\nTaiwan is a self-governing island and considers itself distinct from China, but Beijing views it as a breakaway province and hopes to bring it back under its own control.\n\nThe national security package also includes a provision that could lead to a nationwide ban on TikTok.\n\nThe popular social media app's China-based parent company has nine months to sell its stake and find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down across the US.\n\nThe statute gives the US president the option of extending the deadline by an additional 90 days, which means the latest the ban could take effect is nearly a year from now.\n\nThe TikTok provision drew bipartisan support, with lawmakers arguing that the Chinese government could invoke security laws to compel ByteDance to hand over data about the app's estimated 170 million US users.\n\nTikTok has repeatedly said it has not provided, and would not provide, its foreign user data to the Chinese government.\n\nOn Saturday, the House of Representatives held a separate vote on a border-security bill that included conservative priorities, but it did not garner the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome a procedural hurdle.\n\nIn the Senate, several Republicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, voted against the Ukraine aid package because it did not include increased funding for US border security.\n\nCruz called it one of the toughest votes of his congressional career, but that the US needed to address the immigration issue first.\n\n\"I can't continue to allocate funds to secure Ukraine's border before we secure our own,\" Cruz said.\n\nIn February, a group of Democratic and Republican senators proposed a foreign aid package that included significant immigration policy reforms and additional funding.\n\nThat effort collapsed, however, after former President Donald Trump and his congressional allies said the changes were not enough. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We completed this half-year path. Regardless of what anyone says, we are gaining the support we need to continue protecting lives from Russian attacks. Over the past few days, we have already been actively working with our American friends on all levels to include the exact types of weapons that our warriors require in this package. It totals $1 billion and includes exactly what we discussed with President Biden during our call. I am grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans who recognize that we must cut the ground under Putin's feet rather than obeying him, as this is the only way to truly reduce threats to freedom.

Adam Schiff] I won't tell you that he just voted to send $100 billion abroad. We have a US national debt of $35 trillion.\n\nRichard Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany, in a social media post on April 20.\n\nAs the House approved aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on Saturday, a leading candidate for secretary of state in a second Trump administration announced that lawmakers had voted to send $100 billion abroad. His stunt was a common talking point among opponents of the bill.\n\nThe implication is that foreign aid is just a gift with no strings attached. This is not the case. About two-thirds of foreign aid is spent through U.S.-based entities, according to the Congressional Research Service. For example, food aid must be purchased in the United States and, by law, must be shipped by U.S. carriers. With the exception of some aid to Israel, all military aid must be used to purchase U.S. military equipment and training.\n\nSince these bills for Ukraine, for Israel and the Pacific region are primarily about military aid, this means that they are really about US jobs programs, which, in turn, support the American economy. The Senate approved the spending package on Tuesday, and President Biden signed it into law on Wednesday. Let's explore.\n\nThe total cost of the project was estimated at $95.25 billion. But information provided by the White House budget office and a detailed review of the bill show that nearly 80 percent went either to U.S. gun manufacturers to replenish their stockpiles or supply weapons or to fund Department of Defense operations in the United States and abroad (including training of Ukrainian soldiers).\n\nJust over $20 billion was earmarked for humanitarian or economic assistance, which, as noted above, often requires the funds to go to U.S.-based organizations. Of this amount, around $8 billion is set aside to help the Ukrainian government, including $50 million to deal with food shortages. Another $5.6 billion is for general international disaster assistance and $3.5 billion for refugee aid.\n\nWhile previous bills regarding Ukraine provided funds to help the government maintain old-age pensions, this bill prohibits direct payments for pension support. Indeed, the bill calls on Biden to negotiate a deal with Ukraine to repay its economic support, although 50% of the debt could be canceled after November 15 with notification to Congress, with the remaining 50% able to be canceled after January 1, 2026.\n\nAs is often the case with appropriations bills, there are different ways to evaluate the numbers. If we look at the plan another way, about $60 billion will support Ukraine, $14 billion will support Israel, and about $8 billion will go to helping countries in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly Taiwan. Another $9 billion will go toward humanitarian aid in conflict zones (including beyond Ukraine and Gaza) and $2.5 billion will support central command operations. Nearly $500 million is earmarked for the resettlement of Ukrainian refugees in the United States.\n\n60 percent will not leave our shores\n\nNearly $57 billion, about 60 percent of it, never leaves the United States. Instead, these funds are invested with gun manufacturers located in dozens of states. (So far, according to the Pentagon, manufacturers in all but 11 states have received Ukraine-related arms contracts.)\n\nAbout $24.5 billion is intended to replenish stocks of weapons supplied to Ukraine, Israel and other countries, such as 155mm rounds. The United States is providing defense items to Ukraine and Israel through the Presidential Withdrawal Authority, under which Biden can authorize the immediate transfer of items and services from U.S. stockpiles. Now those stocks will be replenished, meaning U.S. arms factories will operate nonstop.\n\nNearly $14 billion will fund the purchase of advanced weapons systems for Ukraine, such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, a lightweight multiple rocket launcher built by Lockheed Martin in Arkansas.\n\nAn additional $1.6 billion will be used to replenish US military stocks located in Israel, including artillery shells and missiles. These are pre-positioned for US military use, but also available to Israel if needed.\n\nNearly $5 billion will be used to increase military production capacity to meet the needs of Ukraine, Israel and other countries. For example, the production rate for 155mm caliber artillery shells was about 10,000 per month, and the administration wants to increase this to 1 million per year, a substantial increase that will include the purchase of shell casings. additional weapons, explosive charges, nuclear warheads and detonators.\n\nMore than $7 billion, half of which goes to Israel, is earmarked for a State Department program called Foreign Military Financing, under which U.S. grants or loans are provided to countries to buy American military equipment. (The bill also amends lending authorizations under a previous Ukrainian law to allow up to $8 billion in direct loans and $8 billion in loan guarantees to NATO and key non-NATO allies. NATO to purchase American military equipment.)\n\nNearly $3.3 billion will be used to increase production of submarines, such as the Virginia-class submarines, from an average of 1.3 per year to two per year. Each Virginia-class submarine costs approximately $4.3 billion.\n\nFinally, the bill provided $1.6 billion to build additional missile defense systems for Israel.\n\n19 percent will go to the Pentagon and US intelligence\n\nThe bill provides nearly $18 billion for defense spending to help the Pentagon and intelligence services finance the costs of dealing with the aftermath of the war in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Gaza . The bill replenishes both money that has already been spent and money that will be needed for the remainder of the year, officials said. The bill specifically references $2.4 billion for U.S. Central Command, which conducts overseas operations in the Middle East, $1.9 billion for supplemental maintenance and $2.4 billion for dollars for combat and other expenses, including at U.S. bases in the United States. But the money for intelligence activities is classified, so it is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of all spending.\n\n21 percent will go mainly to aid and diplomacy\n\nThis item includes $8 billion to help the Ukrainian government, $5.6 billion in general international disaster assistance and $3.5 billion in refugee aid. The bill has many other smaller spending categories, such as additional funds for the State Department to support diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and increased funds for inspectors general.\n\nAllies fill their baskets here\n\nAn underappreciated aspect of Russia's war in Ukraine is how NATO allies have also spent significant funds purchasing advanced U.S. weapons to replace the equipment they gave to Ukraine. Finland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland have flooded American manufacturers with orders since the start of the war. For example, Poland gave 250 older tanks to Ukraine and then signed contracts worth more than $6 billion to purchase nearly 370 Abrams tanks (made in Ohio). Warsaw also gave Ukraine Soviet-made attack helicopters and in turn signed a $12 billion deal to replace them with Apache helicopters (made in Arizona).\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the percentage of arms purchases from American companies reached the following percentages: Netherlands (99%), Italy (89%) , Norway (89%), Great Britain (89%). percent), Denmark (70 percent), Germany (63 percent) and Poland (45 percent).\n\nGrenell did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe only thing Grenell got right was that the bill costs nearly $100 billion. This was emergency spending and therefore was not funded by offsetting revenue, which can be troubling if you're a deficit hawk.\n\nBut it is very misleading to say that these funds go to foreign countries. Nearly 80 percent will be spent on weapons made in the United States or by the U.S. military. This spending may benefit foreign countries like Ukraine in its war against Russia, but the money is primarily used to create jobs in the United States.\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to

Taiwan is slated to receive 8 billion USD in assistance.\n\nAdditionally, the package includes provisions for the transfer of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine and imposes new sanctions on Russia, China, Hamas, and Iran. Despite initial opposition from some members, the bipartisan-supported measure successfully passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to officially sign the package into law today, facilitating the prompt delivery of American weapons to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed gratitude to US lawmakers for their crucial support, emphasizing the significance of the aid for Ukraine's security and stability.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the passage of the bill as a pivotal step in safeguarding American security and promoting Western democracy.

One for Ukraine, a second with US$26 billion for Israel, a third with US$8.12 billion \"to counter communist China\" in the Indo-Pacific and a fourth that includes a potential ban on the social media app TikTok.\n\nThe Ukraine Bill also calls for the transfer of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) with a range of up to 300km, which Kyiv has pledged not to use inside Russia's territory.\n\nRussia has increased its long-range bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and its cities in recent weeks, ratcheting up the pressure on Kyiv as Moscow's more numerous and better equipped forces slowly advance on the battlefield in the east.\n\nOnce the Ukraine Bill is signed, funds to replenish stocks would rebound, alleviating Pentagon concerns that the use of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to aid Ukraine would compromise US military preparedness.\n\nTens of billions of dollars in the Bill was earmarked to buy replacements for weapons sent to Ukraine along with transportation and administrative overhead.\n\nThe Bill gives the president US$8 billion worth of further Presidential Drawdown Authority. This added to the US$3.9 billion remaining from previously authorised PDA means Mr Biden can transfer US$11.9 billion worth of excess weapons from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.\n\nAs the replenishment funds are deployed, US defence companies would gain more contracts as the Russia-Ukraine war grinds on.\n\nExperts expect a boost in the order backlog of RTX

According to unnamed sources, some of the items on the list can be shipped \"within days,\" but others could take longer to deliver.\n\nThe Pentagon has neither confirmed nor denied the report of a new package ready to be shipped, but press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told journalists on Tuesday that the US military is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the foreign aid package clears procedural hurdles.\n\n\"I think it's a good assumption to expect that it'll include air defense capabilities as well as artillery, ammunition,\" Ryder said. \"I will say again, that this security assistance package will be based on Ukraine's most urgent needs.\"\n\nThe $95 billion funding package, including $61 billion for Ukraine, is expected to advance to a Senate vote on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning, after the senators voted overwhelmingly to end a filibuster on the issue.\n\nPresident Biden already reassured his Ukrainian colleague Vladimir Zelensky in a phone call on Monday that weapons shipments will begin rapidly after the bill clears the Senate and comes to the Oval Office for his signature. While the White House offered few details on Biden-Zelensky call, the Ukrainian leader claimed that Kiev will be receiving longer-range ATACMS missiles.\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar US aid package was requested by the White House months ago but was only passed by the House of Representatives on Saturday, after Speaker Mike Johnson agreed to it.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu noted on Tuesday that America's expected military assistance for Kiev is intended to \"prevent the collapse\" of Ukrainian forces, but predicted that the money will not significantly impact the situation on the battlefield, since \"most of the funding will go to US military production.\"\n\n\"The American authorities cynically state that Ukrainians will be dying in the fight with Russia for their interests,\" Shoigu stated.

Another $8 billion will go to counter Chinese threats in Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific. US officials said about $1 billion of the aid could be on its way shortly, with the bulk following in the coming weeks.\n\nThe war in Gaza erupted on October 7 when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led a devastating cross-border attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel responded with a military campaign to destroy Hamas and free 253 hostages abducted during the attack. The fighting has led to a humanitarian crisis in Gaza as aid workers struggle to deliver supplies.\n\nBiden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the bill reaches Gaza \"without delay.\"\n\nThe announcement that the war aid measure was signed marks an end to a long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\n\"We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done,\" Biden said at a White House event to announce the signing. \"Now we need to move fast, and we are.\"\n\nTucked into the measure is a provision that gives TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there's a path to divestiture and \"significant progress\" toward executing it.\n\nThe administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern.\n\nTikTok said it will wage a legal challenge against what it called an \"unconstitutional\" effort by Congress.\n\n\"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail,\" the company said in a statement. \"The fact is, we have invested billions of dollars to keep US data safe and our platform free from outside influence and manipulation. This ban would devastate seven million businesses and silence 170 million Americans.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on the supplemental aid package for months as members of his party's far right wing, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, threatened to move to oust him if he allowed a vote to send more assistance to Ukraine. Those threats persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested his fellow Republicans' holding up the funding could have a lasting impact on Ukraine's hopes of winning the war.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Delay in providing Ukraine the weapons to defend itself has strained the prospects of defeating Russian aggression,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Dithering and hesitation have compounded the

It's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world, and everyone knows it,\" said Biden.\n\nThe president said the bill included \"support to strengthen even further our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.\" When news broke that the Senate had passed the bill on Tuesday, Biden said that the bill was urgent for \"our partners seeking security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nTaiwan and Indo-Pacific countries are set to receive US$8.12 billion. Of that, US$2 billion is earmarked for a Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program for Taiwan and other U.S. allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region. Another US$1.9 billion will be allocated to replenish defense articles and services supplied to Taiwan and other regional U.S. partners.\n\nThe rest of the funds will be directed at strengthening the U.S. military presence in the region. This includes US$3.3 billion to build submarine infrastructure, US$542 million to bolster U.S. military capabilities, and US$133 million to augment the development of artillery and vital munitions.\n\nThe bill's passage into law comes after months of deadlock. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson on April 17 unveiled his version of long-delayed foreign aid in the form of three bills, one for Taiwan and Indo-Pacific allies, one for Ukraine, and another for Israel. To mollify Republicans, Johnson added a sweetener bill, the \"21st Century Peace through Strength Act,\" that would seize Russian assets to send to Ukraine, force ByteDance to sell off TikTok, and impose \"sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\"\n\nBiden pointed out that \"while MAGA Republicans were blocking aid, Ukraine has been running out of artillery shells and ammunition.\" He said that now that word has reached Ukraine about the passage of the bill, \"There are reports of cheers breaking out of the trenches in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said that the bill also includes \"vital support for Israel,\" as he noted that Iran had fired over 100 missiles and drones at the country 10 days prior.

James Lankford, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema huddled for months before reaching a deal.\n\nBut former Republican President Donald Trump urged GOP lawmakers to block the bill from advancing in the Senate amid concerns that it would provide a win to the Biden administration in a policy area that weighs heavily for many voters.\n\nAfter Senate Republicans blocked a package that included the bipartisan border security bill, that chamber moved to pass a $95 billion emergency spending package with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nThat measure passed in February, but spent the next two months stalled in the House as Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, held a series of meetings on whether that chamber should act.\n\nJohnson ultimately decided to move forward, releasing four bills that would each receive separate votes, before being bundled as one package and sent to the Senate.\n\nThe $95 billion in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan was strikingly similar to the Senate bill with an exception that economic aid for Ukraine be categorized as a forgivable loan.\n\nThe House voted Saturday to approve all four bills on broadly bipartisan votes and the Senate voted Tuesday night to send the package to Biden's desk.\n\nHouse GOP leaders added a measure to the emergency spending bills -- called the 21st Century Peace through Strength Act -- that wrapped together numerous bills, including the one that requires ByteDance to sell the social media app within one year or face a possible ban within the United States.\n\nWashington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chairwoman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said Tuesday that she found it \"disturbing\" the Chinese government \"used TikTok to repeatedly access U.S. user data and track multiple journalists covering the company.\"\n\n\"As of December 2023, an analysis by Rutgers University found that TikTok posts mentioning topics that are sensitive to the Chinese Government, including Tiananmen Square, Uighurs, and the Dalai Lama were significantly less prevalent on TikTok than on Instagram, the most comparable social media,\" Cantwell said.\n\n\"Foreign policy issues disfavored by China and Russian Governments also had fewer hashtags on TikTok, such as pro-Ukraine or pro-Israel hashtags,\" she added.\n\nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Tuesday that \"it is not hard to imagine how a platform that facilitates so much commerce, political discourse and social debate could be covertly manipulated to serve the goals of an authoritarian regime, one with a long track record of censorship, transnational oppression and promotion of disinformation.\"", "source": {"uri":

Even with refreshed stocks of weapons and ammunition, Ukraine could struggle to retake the initiative after being driven to the breaking point from months of Russian attacks.\n\n\"I'm making sure the shipments start right away. In the next few hours -- literally in a few hours -- we are going to begin sending equipment to Ukraine for air defense munitions, artillery for rocket systems, and armored vehicles,\" Biden said at the White House.\n\n\"It's a good day for America, it is a good day for Americans. It's a good day for world peace,\" he added. \"It's going to make America safer, is going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world.\"\n\nThe president is expected to swiftly approve an initial $1 billion military assistance package that includes artillery shells, air-defense munitions and other weapons, according to US officials, the first transfer from $61 billion in new Ukraine funding. That will boost Ukrainian forces that have been battered by Russian President Vladimir Putin's offensive.\n\nRead More: US Senate Passes Ukraine Aid, Arms Shipments to Resume in Days", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The Israeli government's campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and created a hunger crisis there.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel,\" Mr Biden said, \"is ironclad\".\n\nMr Biden's critics on the left are angry about his willingness to provide more weapons to Israel, though the legislation also includes $US1 billion for humanitarian aid that the president said will be rushed to Gaza.\n\n\"Israel must make sure this aid reaches all of the Palestinians in Gaza, without delay,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nThe president's signature capped a long road for the White House, one of careful political manoeuvring with a new House speaker who faced vehement opposition from the far right of the Republican Party over helping Ukraine.\n\n\"Imagine if instead we had failed,\" Mr Biden said as he admonished \"MAGA Republicans\" for allowing Ukrainian officials to run low on artillery.\n\nThe White House first sent a request for the security package in October, but Republicans -- many of them egged on by former President Donald Trump -- said the United States was bearing too much of the burden. Mr Trump, who has long expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia, has made clear that he would not back Ukraine if he wins in November.\n\nUS officials have bluntly acknowledged that the six-month delay put Ukraine at a disadvantage in its fight against Russia.\n\n\"The Russians have slowly but successfully taken more ground from the Ukrainians and pushed them back against their first, second and, in some places, their third line of defence,\" John Kirby, a spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council, said on Tuesday on Air Force One. \"The short answer is: 'Yes, there absolutely has been damage in the last several months'.\"\n\nThe White House strategy in recent months involved impressing upon members of Congress -- and the American people -- that Ukraine could lose the war without the desperately needed aid.\n\nMr Biden instructed his top aides to avoid publicly criticising Speaker Mike Johnson but instead to provide him with regular security briefings on the risks of not sending aid, according to senior administration officials. The officials asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nJake Sullivan, the national security adviser, assured Mr Johnson in one call that the United States would be sure to track all of the aid after the speaker called for more accountability over the security assistance.\n\nMr Biden's chief of staff, Jeff Zients, held daily strategy sessions with the president's top aides, including Mr Sullivan; Steve Ricchetti, a senior counselor; and Shuwanza Goff, the director of legislative affairs.\n\nLast month, as the aid remained stuck in gridlock, Mr Sullivan made a secret mission to Kyiv, Ukraine, keeping the issue in the headlines.\n\nMr Johnson has said that the security briefings, led by CIA Director William Burns, were a crucial factor to winning over his support.\n\nThe aid is broken up into four pieces: a measure for each of the three US allies and another meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that includes a provision that could result in a nationwide ban on TikTok.\n\nThe bill includes $US60.8 billion for Ukraine; $US26.4 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $US8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It also includes sanctions against Iranian and Russian officials.\n\nThe House also added a provision that would require the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $US10 billion. The idea to include some of the aid for Ukraine in the form of a loan was another example of the influence Mr Trump has over Congress.\n\nMr Trump has called to make any future aid to Ukraine a loan.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 at the Pentagon in Washington.\n\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war.\n\nThe decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday. President Joe Biden said he would sign it Wednesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine.\n\nThe package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not confirm the package or details, but said the U.S. has a robust logistical system in place, built over the past two years of weapons' deliveries to Ukraine, and is \"doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly\" once the bill is signed. He said the U.S. has storehouses of military equipment in Europe and -- as it's done in the past -- can tap those to get aid into Ukraine within days.\n\nAmerica's infusion of weapons comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on Tuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe announcement reflects Biden's promise Monday in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. would send the badly needed air defense weapons once the Senate approved the bill. Zelensky said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden also assured him that a coming package of aid would include long-range and artillery capabilities.\n\nThe latest tranche of weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, which pulls systems and munitions from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front. Some of the munitions are already in Europe, so could move within days to Ukrainian forces.\n\nLast week, an array of U.S. leaders described how urgently Ukraine needs the infusion of aid. Without it, said CIA Director Bill Burns, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told House members that conditions on the battlefield were shifting and Russian forces were making incremental gains.\n\nGen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly describe the situation to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying Ukraine is facing \" dire battlefield conditions.\" Desperate Ukrainian troops are rationing or running out of ammunition on the front lines.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting last Friday of defense ministers in the NATO-Ukraine Council, Austin underscored the need for \"immediate, concerted action\" on air defense weapons for Kyiv, the Pentagon said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Zelenskyy attended the meeting, along with other NATO allies.\n\nPentagon leaders were preparing to meet with defense officials from Europe and around the world on Friday to discuss international aid for Ukraine. The gathering -- created by Austin and known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- has been meeting about monthly for the past two years, but in recent sessions officials have expressed growing consternation over the U.S. gridlock.\n\nMore than $20 billion in the aid bill is earmarked to replenish U.S. military stocks that have been depleted because they were sent to Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. For the bulk of that time, the aid packages were moving routinely every few weeks. But the money was drying up by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. And by mid-December, the Pentagon said it had run out of money and had to stop sending weapons because, without the funding package stalled in Congress, it could no longer afford to replace them.\n\nThe $1 billion package was first reported by Reuters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It features a host of equipment, including air defense interceptors, armored vehicles, anti-tank weapons and artillery rounds -- among which are cluster munitions.\n\n\"We need to move fast, and we are,\" Biden said from the White House Wednesday.\n\nIn addition, the Pentagon confirmed Wednesday the U.S. sent Ukraine long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, earlier this year. Biden made the decision in February, and the missiles were included in a $300 million package gathered from savings on various weapons contracts in March.\n\nThe missiles arrived this month, kept secret \"to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\" said Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Garron Garn. Kyiv had sought the missiles for more than a year, in part to push Russian forces farther back.\n\nAside from that package, the Pentagon hasn't given Ukraine any aid since December, when it ran out of money to replace anything it sent. The administration requested a massive round of supplemental funding in the fall, but it sat mired in Congress until this week.\n\nWhat forced it through was largely the dire situation in Ukraine. Earlier this month, head of U.S. European Command Gen. Chris Cavoli told lawmakers that Russia could fire five artillery rounds to every one Ukraine could return.\n\n\"That will immediately go to 10 to one in a matter of weeks,\" Cavoli said.\n\nCavoli and Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said this month Russia has been able to rebuild its forces faster than the U.S. expected and even expanded its frontline forces to 470,000, or an army 15% larger than before the war.\n\nThe combination of Russia's quick rebuilding and Ukraine's dwindling stocks threatened a crisis on the front lines, one the supplemental is meant to avoid.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns warned this month Russia could win on the battlefield -- or at least force a favorable political settlement -- by the end of 2024 without U.S. funding.\n\nThis set of aid is far larger than even those sent late last year, when the Pentagon still had money to replenish its stocks. While waiting for Congress to act, Pentagon officials planned a ready-to-go package filled with Ukraine's most pressing needs.\n\n\"This package will surge munitions, weapons, and equipment forward to support Ukraine's ability to defend its frontlines, protect its cities, and counter Russia's continued attacks,\" read a Pentagon announcement.\n\nThe $95 billion supplemental bill includes around $48 billion in Ukraine-related funding for the Pentagon.

Political divisiveness and the upcoming US elections could complicate the passage of further aid. Experts suggest Ukraine use aid to build defenses and negotiate with Russia to prevent further losses.\n\nWar experts are advising Ukraine to use its latest $61 billion US aid package cautiously as there is always the possibility that American aid could again be derailed by politics.\n\n\"Every fight over every next increment has gotten increasingly contentious and increasingly long,\" said Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to the months-long deliberation of the most recent package for Ukraine that passed in the Senate on Wednesday and past assistance debates. \"I think that the plan should be what if there is no more money.\"\n\nDuring a Defense Priorities Wednesday discussion panel, experts such as Kelly Grieco, a Stimson Center senior fellow, weighed in, saying that \"everyone involved in this conflict should treat this aid package as though it's the last one and plan accordingly, because that could be.\"\n\nThe upcoming US presidential election, in which the presumed Republican candidate is far less supportive of Ukraine, as well as the continued divisiveness of the Ukraine security assistance discussion between the political parties in Congress, could complicate the passage of future aid for Ukraine, which has not been brought up yet but almost certainly will as the war drags on.\n\n\"It's uncertain who's going to be in office in January,\" Kavanagh said, further remarking that there is \"certainly no appetite for starting the fight over January 2025 now.\"\n\nServicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine undergo training to storm enemy trenches using simulation equipment as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues in Kharkiv Region, Ukraine on February 29, 2024.

It cannot win militarily in any way, it can win politically, though,\" Grieco said. \"It can actually gain a political victory by not allowing Putin to achieve his main goal, which is to subjugate Ukraine,\" she said, noting that \"Ukraine can remain a viable state and an independent state from Russia.\"\n\nBoth Grieco and Kavanagh emphasized the importance of Ukraine showing up to the negotiating table and using diplomacy with Russia to prevent further land losses.\n\nUkrainian soldiers reload an artillery unit on the front line, in the direction of the Kreminna as Russian - Ukraine war continues in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on January 30, 2024. Foto: Ignacio Marin/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nOther experts, as well as Ukrainian officials, are critical of calls for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and have said that Vladimir Putin would demand the \"demilitarization\" of Ukraine in order to take advantage of it.\n\nExperts of the Washington-based Institute of the Study of War said in a March report that they continue to \"assess that Russian President Vladimir Putin maintains his maximalist objectives in Ukraine, which are tantamount to complete Ukrainian and Western capitulation, and that Russia has no interest in good-faith negotiations with Ukraine.\"\n\nISW has challenged the notion that the war is '\"unwinnable\" for Ukraine, calling that a Russian information operation.\n\nUkraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba has said that Russia cannot be trusted, a reality he says is proven by its documented failures to live up to past negotiations.\n\nHe reminded the world last November in a statement on social media that \"Putin is a habitual liar who promised international leaders that he would not attack Ukraine days before his invasion in February 2022.\" Kuleba said no one can seriously expect the Ukrainians to negotiate with Russia.\n\nThe challenge is that six months of delayed assistance have put Ukraine in a difficult position, one that may not immediately be rectified by the coming aid.\n\nDuring the panel discussion Wednesday, Kavanagh argued that starting negotiations will also buy Ukraine time as it's expected that the approved US aid will not be flowing in all at once. \"The reality is that politics is involved, which means that things won't be perfect and there will be delays,\" she said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri":

The measure will quickly pass the Senate and be signed into law by Biden within days.\n\nThe funds, however, will make little difference to the outcome of the war on the ground as it appears most of the military hardware funded by the $61 billion has already been produced and much of it already shipped. Perhaps no more than $10 billion in additional new weapons and equipment will result from the latest $61 billion passed by Congress.\n\nSubject to revision, initial reports of the composition of the $61 billion indicate $23.2 billion of it will go to pay US arms producers for weapons that have already been produced and delivered to Ukraine. Another $13.8 billion is earmarked to replace weapons from US military stocks that have been produced and are in the process of being shipped -- but haven't as yet -- or are additional weapons still to be produced. The breakdown of this latter $13.8 amount is not yet clear in the initial reports. One might generously guess perhaps $10 billion at most represents weapons not yet produced, while $25-$30 billion represents weapons already shipped to Ukraine or in the current shipment pipeline.\n\nIn total, therefore, weapons already delivered to Ukraine, awaiting shipment, or yet to be produced amount to approximately $37 billion.\n\nThe remainder of the $61 billion includes $7.8 billion for financial assistance to Ukraine to pay for salaries of government employees through 2024. An additional $11.3 billion to finance current Pentagon operations in Ukraine -- which sounds suspiciously like pay for US advisors, mercenaries, special ops, and US forces operating equipment like radars, advanced Patriot missile systems, etc. on the ground. Another $4.7 billion is for miscellaneous expenses, whatever that is.\n\nIn other words, only $13.8 billion of the $61 billion is for weapons Ukraine doesn't already have!\n\nAnd that $13.8 billion is all Ukraine will likely get in new weapons funding for the rest of 2024! Like the $23 billion already in theater, that will likely be burned up in a couple of weeks this summer once Russia's coming major offensive -- its largest of the war -- is launched in late May or early June. So what does the US do in order to continue to fund Ukraine's economy, government and military efforts this fall and thereafter?\n\nIn other words, what's the Biden/NATO strategy for aiding Ukraine, militarily and economically, after the $37 billion is expended by late this summer? Where's the money to come from?\n\nTo understand how the US/NATO plan to fund subsequent weapons production for Ukraine in late 2024 and early 2025, one must consider not only the $61 billion bill but a second bill also passed by Congress this past weekend that hasn't been given much attention in the mainstream media.\n\nThat second bill may potentially provide up to $300 billion for Ukraine from USA and its G7 allies, especially NATO allies in Europe where reportedly $260 of the $300 billion resides in Eurozone banks.\n\nBiden/US Short Term Strategy 2024\n\nThe $61 billion is clearly only a stopgap measure to try to get the Ukraine army and government funded through the summer. Beyond that, the broader Biden strategy is to keep Ukraine afloat until after the US November elections. In addition to the $61 billion -- which the US hopes will get Ukraine through the US November election (but likely won't) -- US strategy includes getting the Russians to agree to begin some kind of negotiations. The US will then use the discussions to raise a demand to freeze military operations on both sides while negotiations are underway. But Biden's 'freeze and negotiate' strategy is dead on arrival, since it is abundantly clear to the Russians it is basically about US and NATO 'buying time' and Russia has already been played by that one. As the popular US saying goes: \"fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me\".\n\nThe Russians already fell for that 'let's suspend fighting and negotiation ploy' with the Minsk II treaty back in 2015-16. It agreed to halt military operations in the Donbass back then but NATO and the Ukraine government used the Minsk agreement as cover to re-build Ukraine's military force which it thereafter used to attack the Donbass provinces. European leaders Angela Merkel of Germany and Francois Holland of France thereafter publicly admitted in 2022 that Minsk II was just to 'buy time'.\n\nThe Russian's were again similarly snookered at the Istanbul peace discussions held in April 2022. They were asked by NATO to show good faith in negotiations by withdrawing their forces from around Kiev, which they did. Negotiations were then broken off by Zelensky, on NATO's strong recommendation, and Ukraine launched an offensive chasing the withdrawing Russians all the way back to the Donbass borders.\n\nRussia is therefore extremely unlikely to fall a third time for a Biden/NATO request to 'freeze' military operations and negotiate again.\n\nBiden may want to 'buy time' once more, but that hand's been played twice already and the West will be (is being) told by Russia they aren't interested in buying anything from the West and its 'money' no longer has any value.\n\nSpeaker Johnson's Volte Face\n\nThe passage of the stop-gap $61 billion for Ukraine by the US House of Representatives was the result of House Speaker, Johnson, doing an about face and allowing the vote on the House floor after saying he wouldn't for weeks. There's been much speculation in the US mainstream media as to why Johnson reversed his position and allowed the Ukraine aid bill to the House floor for a vote. However, it's not difficult to understand why he did reverse his view.\n\nIn recent weeks there was intense lobbying behind the scenes by US weapons companies with key Republican committee chairmen in the House. After all, at least $37 billion in payments for weapons -- both already delivered and to be delivered -- was involved. Not a minor sum even for super-profitable companies like Lockheed, Raytheon and the like. Rumors are that corporate lobbying had its desired effect on Republican committee chairs in the House, who then in turn pressured Johnson to allow the vote on the floor. The final vote in the House was 310 to 111 with 210 Democrats joining 100 Republicans to pass the measure -- revealing that the core support for the US Military Industrial Complex in the House of Representatives is at least three-fourths (the US Senate likely even higher).\n\nSo the vote was the result of a 'parliamentary maneuver' in which all the Democrats crossed over to support the Republican Speaker of the House (who de factor switched parties for the moment). A minority of Republicans joined him. A slim majority of Republicans opposed the measure. Their opposition remains. Thus it is highly unlikely Congress will appropriate more funding for Ukraine for the rest of this year -- even when the $61 billion for weapons and Ukraine's government run out by this late summer.\n\nSo what happens if and when the $61 billion is exhausted well before the November elections?\n\nA possible answer to that question lies in the passage of a second Ukraine funding measure this past weekend. The $61 billion was not the most important legislative action in the US House. While most of the media commentary has been on that Ukraine aid bill, hardly anything has been said in the mainstream media about another bill that the US House also passed over the weekend. This second measure has greater strategic implications for US global interests than the $37 billion in actual weapons shipments for Ukraine. This second measure is HR 8038, a 184 page bill misnamed the '21 Century Peace Through Strength Act' which amounted to yet another package (the 16?) of US sanctions.\n\nTransferring Russia's $300 Billion Assets to Ukraine\n\nThe first section of the bill arranges a procedure for the US to force the sale of the China company, Tik Tok, to a consortium of US financial investors, reportedly led by former US Treasury Secretary under Trump, Steve Mnuchin. This is part of the expanding list of sanctions on China. Also sanctioned are China purchases of Iranian oil, as well as a host of additional sanctions on Iran itself. However the most significant measure related to sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe 21 Century Peace Through Strength Act calls for the US to transfer its $5 billion share of Russia's $300 billion of seized assets in western banks that were frozen in 2022 at the outset of the Ukraine war. It provides a procedure to hand over the $5 billion to Ukraine to further finance its war efforts! This move has been rumored and debated in the USA and Europe since the assets were seized two years ago. But now the process of actually transferring the seized funds to Ukraine has begun with the passage of this second bill by the US House.\n\nThe USA's $5 billion share in US banks is just a drop in the bucket of the $300 billion. Russia could probably care less about it, i.e. a mere 'rounding error' in its total revenue from sale of oil, gas and other commodities. But Europe holds $260 of the $300 billion, according to European Central Bank chair, Christine LaGarde. A tidy sum which Russia has threatened to retaliate against Europe should the EU follow the US/Biden lead and also begin to transfer its $260 billion to Ukraine.\n\nThe US bill is very clear that the transfer of the US's $5 billion is imminent. The bill requires the Biden administration to establish a 'Ukraine Defense Fund' into which the US's $5 billion will be deposited. If parts of the $5 billion are not in liquid asset form, the US president is further authorized by the bill to liquidate those assets and deposit the proceeds in the fund as well. So the seizure and transfer of the $5 billion to Ukraine is a done deal. And when it happens a legal precedent will be made that Europe may use to follow and transfer its $260 billion.\n\nOne can expect the US to pressure Europe strongly to do so. Biden is further authorized by the bill to 'negotiate' with Europe and other G7 partners to convince them to do the same -- i.e. seize their share of the $300 billion, liquidate and then transfer the cash assets into the US 'Ukraine Defense Fund'. And to date the US has been able to 'convince' Europe -- via its control of NATO and influence over Europe's economy and its umbrella political elites in the European Commission and European Parliament -- to follow US policy without too much resistance. Europe is fast becoming an economic satrapy and political dependency of the USA in recent decades, more than willing to bend in whatever policy direction the USA wants.\n\nIt is clear the seizure & redistribution to Ukraine of the $300 billion via the Ukraine Defense Fund is the means by which the US/NATO plan longer term to continue to finance the Ukraine war after the $61 billion runs out sometime in 2024; and certainly in 2025 and beyond. For the US has no intention of ending its NATO led proxy war in Ukraine anytime soon. It is just seeking to 'buy time' in the interim before its November elections.\n\nFor a majority of both parties in the US -- Democrat and Republican -- are united on continuing the war. It will matter little who wins the presidency or which party has majorities in Congress after November. Political elites on both sides of the aisle in Congress are united in pursuing the war in Ukraine -- just as they are united in continuing to fund Israel as well as to continue the US's steadily expanding economic war with China. In just the past week it is obvious more US sanctions on China are also coming soon, including possibly an announcements of financial sanctions on China for the first time after US Secretary of State, Blinken's, most recent visit.\n\nFailed Russian Sanctions: Past and Future\n\nThe geopolitical objectives of the US and its commitment to continuing its three wars are resulting in unintended, negative effects on the economies of the US and its G7 allies, especially Germany. But those same sanctions have had little to no negative impact on Russia's economy.\n\nThe recently passed US transfer of its $5 billion share of Russia's $300 billion will accelerate the negative consequences especially for Europe should the latter follow the US lead and distribute its $260 billion share to Ukraine, which it eventually will.\n\nAs EBC chairperson, Lagarde, put it referring to the US plan and legislation: \"It needs to be carefully considered\". UK political leaders are already on record advocating the confiscation and transferring of Europe's $260 billion holdings of Russian assets to Ukraine. Europe in recent years has a strong history of capitulating to US economic policies and demands. It will be no different this time.\n\nShould Europe join the USA in transferring its $260 billion share of Russian assets in European banks (most of which is in Belgium), it's almost certain that Russia will reply similarly and seize at least an equal amount of European assets still in Russia. The Russian Parliament has officially recently said as much.\n\nPart of the G7/NATO sanctions to date included forcing western businesses in Russia to liquidate and leave Russia. Some have done so. But many have not. Russia's response has been to arrange the transfer of those EU companies' assets that have left to Russian companies. This has actually stimulated the Russian economy. It resulted in Russian government subsidies -- and thus government spending -- to Russian companies assuming the assets, as well as additional investment by those companies after their acquisition of the departed EU companies' assets.\n\nIn short, western sanctions measure pressuring western companies to leave Russia has backfired in its predicted result of reducing Russian government spending and business investment.\n\nIn contrast, the US/NATO's fifteen or so sanctions packages to date have had little, if any, impact on Russia's economy since the commencing of the war in February 2022. To cite just a few of the performance of Russia's key economic indicators under the sanctions regime: (Note: all following data is from the US global research source https://tradingeconomics.com ):\n\nRussia's GDP in the latest six months has risen between 4.9% (3 quarter 2023) to 5.5% (4 quarter). Russia's PMI statistics show robust expansion for both manufacturing and services during the same period while in most of the major European economies both PMI indicators are contracting. Wage growth in Russia over the six months has averaged 8.5% for both quarters (whereas in the US is it less than half that and in Germany less than 1%). Russian government revenues rose from roughly 5 trillion rubles in the third quarter to 8.7 trillion in the 4. Military expenditures are up from $69.5 billion (dollars) to $86.3 billion. Consumer spending is at record levels in the latest quarter. Russian household debt as a percent of GDP remains steady at around 22% (whereas in the USA it is 62.5%). Crude oil production and general exports continue to steadily rise. Gasoline remains at 60 cents a liter (whereas in US five-six times that and in Europe more than ten times). And the unemployment rate in Russia remains steady at 2.9% (whereas in the US and Europe it's a quarter to a half higher). Interest rates and inflation are higher in Russia but that represents an economy firing on all economic cylinders and is not necessarily a negative.\n\nIn short, it's hard to find a single statistic that shows the Russian economy has been negatively impacted by the US/NATO sanctions regime over the past two years. Indeed, an argument can even be made the sanctions have stimulated the Russian economy not undermined it.\n\nThe latest sanction in the form of the US and G7 transfer of the $300 billion in seized Russian assets in western banks will almost for certain have a similar effect on Russia's economy. Namely, distributing the $300 billion will result in Russian government seizure of at least an equivalent of European companies' assets still in Russia. And that will provide funding for still further government subsidy spending benefiting Russian companies followed by more private investment.\n\nIs the US Empire Shooting Itself in the Foot?\n\nBut there is an even greater consequence to follow the US and Europe's desperate act of transferring Russia's $300 billion in assets in western banks to Ukraine.\n\nWestern bankers, economic policymakers, and many economists alike have warned against the seizure and transfer of the $300 billion. Heads of US and other central banks, CEOs of large commercial banks, and even mainstream economists like Shiller at Yale have continually warned publicly that transferring the assets will seriously undermine faith in the US dollar system which is the lynchpin of the US global economic empire.\n\nWhat countries in the global South will now want to put (or leave) their assets in western banks, especially in Europe, if they think the assets could be seized should they disagree on policies promoted by the empire? It's clear the US has now begun to impose 'secondary' sanctions on countries that don't abide by its primary sanctions on Russia. Will the US also seize the assets of these 'secondary' countries now in western banks if they don't go along with refusing to trade with Russia? And what about China, as the US has now begun to expand its sanctions -- primary and secondary -- on that country as well? Watch for unprecedented financial sanctions on China that may be forthcoming following Blinken's visit to China this week.\n\nThe US does not realize this is not the 1980s. The global south has developed massively in recent decades. They are insisting on more independence and more say in the rules of the empire -- without which they will simply leave now that an alternative is beginning to appear in the expansion of the BRICS countries.\n\nRecently expanded to 10 members (all of which in the middle east and heavily oil producers), no fewer than 34 more countries have now petitioned to join the BRICS. Furthermore, it is reported that at the BRICS next conference in late 2024 an 'alternative global financial framework' will be announced! That will likely include some alternative currency arrangement as well as an alternative international payments system to replace the US SWIFT system (by which the USA via its banks can see who is violating its sanctions). Likely forthcoming will be something to replace the US-run IMF in order to ensure currency stability and an expansion of China's Belt & Road as an alternative to the US run World Bank. (Perhaps that is the real topic of Blinken's forthcoming China visit?)\n\nIn short, the US global economic empire is entering its most unstable period. And yet US policy is to accelerate alternatives to it by seizing and transferring funds to Ukraine to continue the war! The blowback from the seizure and transfer will prove significant, both to US and European interests. It will render past resistance to US sanctions pale in comparison.\n\nHow to Crash an Empire!\n\nHistory will show that US geopolitical objectives and strategies in the 21 century were the single greatest cause of the decline of US global economic hegemony over the last quarter century. Much of those objectives and strategies have been the work of the most economically ignorant foreign policy team in US history, who are generally referred to as the Neocons.\n\nThe seizure and transfer of the $300 billion may provide a way to continue funding Ukraine in the US/NATO proxy war against Russia through 2024 and beyond. But the timing could not be worse for US/Europe imperial interests, coming on the eve of the historic BRICS conference later this year. The desperate act of seizure and transfer will only convince more countries of the global South to seek another more independent alternative by joining the BRICS, or increasingly trade with that bloc.\n\nHistory shows empires rest ultimately on economic foundations. And they collapse when those underlying economic foundations fracture and then crumble.\n\nThe longer run consequence of the $300 billion transfer and the exiting of the global South from the US empire can only be the decline in the use of the US dollar in global transactions and as a reserve currency. That sets in motion a series of events that in turn undermine the US domestic economy in turn: Less demand for the dollar results in a fall in the dollar's value. That means less recycling of dollars back to the US, resulting in less purchases of US Treasuries from the Federal Reserve, which in turn will require the Fed to raise long term interest rates for years to come in order to cover rising US budget deficits. All this will happen to an intensifying fiscal crisis of the US state rapidly deteriorating already\n\nIn other words, blowback on the US economy from declining US global hegemony -- exacerbated by sanctions in general and seizure of countries like Russia's assets in particular -- is almost certain in the longer run, just as it will be for Europe's economy in the even more immediate term.\n\nBut such is the economic myopia of the US neocons and the incompetent political elite leadership in both parties in the USA in recent years.

It's gonna make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world.\"\n\n\"It gives vital support to Americans partners so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty, and the lives and freedom of their citizens. And it's an investment in our own security. Because when our allies are stronger, and I want to make this point again and again, when our allies are stronger, we are stronger,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a difficult path. It should have been easier and it should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does. We rose to the moment. We came together, and we got it done. Now we need to move fast,\" he added, just hours after the Senate approved the package Tuesday evening.\n\nThe bill includes more than $60.8 billion for Ukraine, $16.6 billion for Israel and $8 billion for Indo-Pacific allies to counter China. The bill would also allocate nearly $9.1 billion for humanitarian efforts worldwide, including in war-torn Gaza where there Israel's war has caused widespread devastation and suffering.\n\nBiden said that in the coming hours his administration will announce a new military assistance package for Ukraine that will include vital weaponry to aid its fight against Russia. That will include more air defense munitions, rocket artillery ammunition and armored vehicles.\n\nThe over $16 billion for Israel meanwhile will be used to \"replenish\" Israel's air defense and other \"critical\" weaponry \"so Iran can never carry out to destruction and attended was its attack 10 days ago,\" Biden said.\n\n\"At the same time, this bill significantly increases humanitarian assistance we're sending to the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering badly. They are suffering the consequences of this war that Hamas started, and we have been working intently for months to get as much aid to Gaza as possible,\" he said.\n\nAbout $1 billion is earmarked for Gaza, and Biden said his administration will \"immediately\" use the funding to \"surge\" additional humanitarian assistance into the war-torn enclave.\n\n\"Israel must make sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay. And everything we do is guided by the ultimate goal of bringing this hostages home, securing a cease-fire, and setting the conditions for an enduring peace,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armoured fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/04/24/thumbs_b_c_9ad8c4839d5b6348fe719ab4aba8c184.jpg?v=185030", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The announcement comes shortly after President Joe Biden signed a national security supplemental into law, demonstrating a firm commitment to supporting Ukraine in its efforts to defend its sovereignty and freedom.\n\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) released a press statement detailing the significant security assistance aimed at meeting Ukraine's urgent defense needs. This latest package marks the fifty-sixth tranche of equipment provided to Ukraine since August 2021, highlighting the ongoing support from the Biden Administration.\n\nThe Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package, with an estimated value of USD 1 billion, includes a range of capabilities tailored to address Ukraine's most pressing requirements. These include air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, anti-tank weapons, and other critical resources essential for bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities.\n\nA key component of the aid package is the provision of 155 mm artillery rounds, along with mortar and artillery ammunition, and air defense munitions such as RIM-7 and AIM-9M. Additionally, the package includes various types of ammunition, including 50 caliber rounds, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.\n\nThe release emphasized that the aid package aims to enhance Ukraine's ability to defend its territory, protect its population centers, and effectively counter Russian aggression. With bipartisan support from Congress, Ukraine can rely on unwavering US leadership and the collaboration of over 50 allies and partners to ensure the provision of critical security assistance.\n\nALSO READ : Pakistan And Iran To Conclude Free Trade Deal Amid US Sanctions Warning\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude following the Senate's clearance of the aid package, highlighting the importance of US support in safeguarding Ukraine's sovereignty.

The aid package represents a tangible demonstration of the commitment to bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities and countering destabilizing actions in the region.\n\nAs tensions between Ukraine and Russia continue to escalate, the US remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Key to getting Republicans to vote for the package was the $9.5 billion in the form of loans, albeit forgivable, which Ukraine can use to buy weaponry.\n\nRegardless, some Republicans are vowing no more.\n\n\"If Ukraine thinks that it's getting another $60 billion supplemental out of the United States Congress, there's no way,\" said Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, The Hill reported Thursday.\n\nVance has been outspoken against the aid from the jump, unlike nine of his GOP colleagues who flipped in support of passing the measure late Tuesday night after originally voting against it in February.\n\nAnother burr in the saddle of Republicans is that the aid bill is now law without any southern border policy attached to it.\n\n\"It makes zero sense for the U.S. to borrow billions to send in unaccountable aid to Ukraine to pay Ukrainian politicians' salaries and secure their border while ours remains totally open. Biden's invasion of criminals and terrorists is a national security disaster,\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said in a post to X.\n\nSaid Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, \"\"While this invasion of Ukraine most certainly poses a national security interest to the United States and a risk to our country, the invasion of America across our southern border is even more important.\"\n\nThe White House said Wednesday that the aid to Ukraine should last the country through the end of the year. What happens then is anybody's guess, with the results of the presidential and congressional elections set to be the primary determinant of what happens in 2025, according to The Hill.\n\nFurther, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is under fire from his conservative flank for his efforts to pass and advance the $95 billion bill and is bracing for a potential movement to oust him. Plus, there will be a new Republican Senate leader after November, replacing Minority Leader and huge Ukraine booster Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nEven Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was one of the nine who flipped in support of the aid, said any supplemental moving forward would have to be paid back.\n\n\"The loan component's going to be bigger, not smaller.

Log in.\n\nA Washington Post analysis published in November identified more than 100 production lines in roughly 30 states and 70 cities where US workers were producing weapons systems for Ukraine -- including California, Arizona, Alabama, and Texas. US aid to Ukraine has created thousands of jobs across at least 38 states, Time reported in February.\n\nIn recent years, some lawmakers have argued that the US should scale back the money it's providing to Ukraine -- and that the funds would be better spent on domestic problems. To the extent foreign aid benefits US-based businesses and workers, the political calculus could change for some in Congress.\n\nTo be sure, some Americans may wish these funds were being directed to other priorities, like making housing and childcare more affordable for citizens. Others may be concerned about the ways defense companies, through lobbying efforts, could be influencing legislation that benefits the industry.\n\nThe spending package, which President Joe Biden intends to sign, would provide about $61 billion for Ukraine to aid its war effort against Russia and $26 billion for Israel, which is engaged in a war with Hamas in Gaza. An additional $8 billion would go to Taiwan to help it counter threats from China. The Senate approved the spending package with a 79 to 18 vote -- the House approved it on April 20.\n\nRoughly $1 billion of the aid could soon be making its way to Ukraine, which the Biden administration says is in urgent need of support as it struggles to combat the advances of Russian forces. The Ukraine aid is expected to be used to provide ammunition, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, and other weapons, the Associated Press reported. The rest could be doled out in the weeks ahead.\n\nWhile it's unclear exactly which cities and states will benefit from the latest foreign aid funds, some candidates are more likely than others.\n\nIn its analysis, The Washington Post pointed to cities like York, Pennsylvania -- where British multinational aerospace, defense, and information security company BAE Systems produces tactical vehicles -- and Troy, Alabama, where Javelin antitank missiles are manufactured, as places that have produced weapons for Ukraine. Peoria, Illinois; Aiken, South Carolina; Elgin, Oklahoma; Niceville, Florida; and Endicott, New York were also mentioned.\n\nWeapons production can require more than one city to work in tandem. Manufacturing artillery ammunition, for example, can involve a Scranton, Pennsylvania factory producing empty projectiles and then sending them to Iowa, where they are filled with explosives, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn June, the defense company General Dynamics is set to open a new factory in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, where artillery casings will be produced. The factory, which is expected to employ 150 people when it opens, is expected to benefit from foreign aid to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business

President Volodymyr Zelensky had been pleading for this money for months, warning that \"if Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war.\"\n\nWashington is Kyiv's main military supporter, but before this week, Congress had not passed a major aid package for its ally since December 2022 due to partisan squabbling.\n\nThe bill provides nearly $14 billion to train, equip and finance the needs of the Ukrainian army.\n\nUkraine will also receive $10 billion in \"forgivable loans\" for vital economic and budgetary support, including for the energy and infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe idea of a loan, rather than a grant, was suggested by former president Donald Trump, who believes the United States should stop handing out money without any payback. A \"forgivable loan\" can be partly or fully forgiven or deferred under certain conditions.\n\nA large chunk of this money will also go to replenishing US military stockpiles.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the US president to confiscate and sell Russian assets in order to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, an idea that is also gaining traction with other G7 countries.\n\n- Israel -\n\nThe United States' historic ally Israel will receive $13 billion in military assistance as it fights Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThese funds will be used in particular to strengthen Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.\n\nMore than $9 billion will be spent to address \"the dire need for humanitarian assistance for Gaza as well as other vulnerable populations around the world.\"\n\nThe measure, however, prohibits any direct US funding of the UN crisis-hit Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Israel has accused some of the agency employees in Gaza of involvement in the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which triggered the war.\n\n- Taiwan, TikTok -\n\nThe bill provides some $8 billion to counter China through investment in submarine infrastructure and boosting competition with Chinese projects in developing countries.\n\nIt also earmarks several billion dollars in weapons funding for Taiwan, a self-ruled island that is claimed by China.\n\nAnother bill passed in the package could force TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a nationwide ban in the United States.\n\nAmerican officials have voiced alarm over the popularity of the video-sharing app with young people, alleging that it is subservient to Beijing and a conduit to spread propaganda, claims denied by the company and Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We can only hope, in the case of this latest aid to Ukraine, the cost of patience doesn't come at the expense of that nation's freedom and security.\n\nThe following is the opinion of Capitol Broadcasting Company\n\nOnly time will tell if as the saying \"better late than never\" goes, it will be enough to enable Ukraine to continue and hold off the relentless deadly aggression of Russia and its dictator Valdimir Putin.\n\nApproval of the critical aid package was delayed by months of hypocritical wrangling, from a handful of GOP legislators at the behest of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump yearning for a campaign issue, in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe needless delay cost lives in Ukraine and critical defensive positions.\n\nThe rapid enactment of the legislation over the last few days reveals just how unnecessary the hold-up was.\n\nBiden signed the legislation just hours after receiving the $95.3 billion package of aide to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The Senate, with a strong bipartisan vote (North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis voted for the package while fellow Republican Ted Budd opposed it), passed it Tuesday night just a couple of days after it came over from the House of Representatives.\n\nIt was in the House, where a small minority of Republicans, including North Carolina's Dan Bishop, reflexively bowed to Trump's desire for a campaign issue on immigration and border security rather than passing compromise legislation that would have moved toward addressing the problem. These hypocrites put politics and the fealty to Trump ahead of problem solving.\n\nFinally on Saturday the House, in a bipartisan 311-112 vote, passed the aid to Ukraine bill and sent it to the Senate.\n\nWednesday afternoon President Joe Biden declared: \"It's a good day for world peace. It's going to make America safer, it's going to make the world safer and it continues America's leadership in the world and everyone knows it.\"\n\nBut he quickly added that the unnecessarily tortured path should have \"been easier and should have gotten there sooner.\"\n\nIt was October - nearly six months ago - when the Biden administration first asked Congress to provide an aide package. Trump, a self-proclaimed admirer of Putin's and who opposes aide to Ukraine, implored House Republicans to block passage on the grounds that the United States was taking on too much of the burden of aiding Ukraine. John F. Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council acknowledged this week the delay has hurt Ukraine's defense. \"The Russians have slowly but successfully taken more ground from the Ukrainians and pushed them back.\"\n\nWill it have been worth Biden's delicate and patient persistence? Has Biden's reluctance to provide Ukraine with the most powerful missiles and other defensive weaponry cost that nation the ability to most effectively defend itself?\n\nIt is not exaggeration that the battling in Ukraine is on the front-line of defending democracy. Those who bow to Trump's demands to play immigration and border politics in the face of those giving up their lives in the fight for freedom in Ukraine are hypocrites.\n\nPresident Biden well-knows that patience is a virtue.

The measure will quickly pass the Senate and be signed into law by Biden within days.\n\nThe funds, however, will make little difference to the outcome of the war on the ground as it appears most of the military hardware funded by the $61 billion has already been produced and much of it already shipped. Perhaps no more than $10 billion in additional new weapons and equipment will result from the latest $61 billion passed by Congress.\n\nSubject to revision, initial reports of the composition of the $61 billion indicate $23.2 billion of it will go to pay US arms producers for weapons that have already been produced and delivered to Ukraine. Another $13.8 billion is earmarked to replace weapons from US military stocks that have been produced and are in the process of being shipped -- but haven't as yet -- or are additional weapons still to be produced. The breakdown of this latter $13.8 amount is not yet clear in the initial reports. One might generously guess perhaps $10 billion at most represents weapons not yet produced, while $25-$30 billion represents weapons already shipped to Ukraine or in the current shipment pipeline.\n\nIn total, therefore, weapons already delivered to Ukraine, awaiting shipment, or yet to be produced amount to approximately $37 billion.\n\nThe remainder of the $61 billion includes $7.8 billion for financial assistance to Ukraine to pay for salaries of government employees through 2024. An additional $11.3 billion to finance current Pentagon operations in Ukraine -- which sounds suspiciously like pay for US advisors, mercenaries, special ops, and US forces operating equipment like radars, advanced Patriot missile systems, etc. on the ground. Another $4.7 billion is for miscellaneous expenses, whatever that is.\n\nIn other words, only $13.8 billion of the $61 billion is for weapons Ukraine doesn't already have!\n\nAnd that $13.8 billion is all Ukraine will likely get in new weapons funding for the rest of 2024! Like the $23 billion already in theater, that will likely be burned up in a couple of weeks this summer once Russia's coming major offensive -- its largest of the war -- is launched in late May or early June. So what does the US do in order to continue to fund Ukraine's economy, government and military efforts this fall and thereafter?\n\nIn other words, what's the Biden/NATO strategy for aiding Ukraine, militarily and economically, after the $37 billion is expended by late this summer? Where's the money to come from?\n\nTo understand how the US/NATO plan to fund subsequent weapons production for Ukraine in late 2024 and early 2025, one must consider not only the $61 billion bill but a second bill also passed by Congress this past weekend that hasn't been given much attention in the mainstream media.\n\nThat second bill may potentially provide up to $300 billion for Ukraine from USA and its G7 allies, especially NATO allies in Europe where reportedly $260 of the $300 billion resides in Eurozone banks.\n\nBiden/US Short Term Strategy 2024\n\nThe $61 billion is clearly only a stopgap measure to try to get the Ukraine army and government funded through the summer. Beyond that, the broader Biden strategy is to keep Ukraine afloat until after the US November elections. In addition to the $61 billion -- which the US hopes will get Ukraine through the US November election (but likely won't) -- US strategy includes getting the Russians to agree to begin some kind of negotiations. The US will then use the discussions to raise a demand to freeze military operations on both sides while negotiations are underway. But Biden's 'freeze and negotiate' strategy is dead on arrival, since it is abundantly clear to the Russians it is basically about US and NATO 'buying time' and Russia has already been played by that one. As the popular US saying goes: \"fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me\".\n\nThe Russians already fell for that 'let's suspend fighting and negotiation ploy' with the Minsk II treaty back in 2015-16. It agreed to halt military operations in the Donbass back then but NATO and the Ukraine government used the Minsk agreement as cover to re-build Ukraine's military force which it thereafter used to attack the Donbass provinces. European leaders Angela Merkel of Germany and Francois Hollande of France thereafter publicly admitted in 2022 that Minsk II was just to 'buy time'.\n\nThe Russian's were again similarly snookered at the Istanbul peace discussions held in April 2022. They were asked by NATO to show good faith in negotiations by withdrawing their forces from around Kiev, which they did. Negotiations were then broken off by Zelensky, on NATO's strong recommendation, and Ukraine launched an offensive chasing the withdrawing Russians all the way back to the Donbass borders.\n\nRussia is therefore extremely unlikely to fall a third time for a Biden/NATO request to 'freeze' military operations and negotiate again.\n\nBiden may want to 'buy time' once more, but that hand's been played twice already and the West will be (is being) told by Russia they aren't interested in buying anything from the West and its 'money' no longer has any value.\n\nSpeaker Johnson's Volte Face\n\nThe passage of the stop-gap $61 billion for Ukraine by the US House of Representatives was the result of House Speaker, Johnson, doing an about face and allowing the vote on the House floor after saying he wouldn't for weeks. There's been much speculation in the US mainstream media as to why Johnson reversed his position and allowed the Ukraine aid bill to the House floor for a vote. However, it's not difficult to understand why he did reverse his view.\n\nImage: Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Mike Johnson delivers remarks following his election to the position, October 25, 2023. (From the Public Domain)\n\nIn recent weeks there was intense lobbying behind the scenes by US weapons companies with key Republican committee chairmen in the House. After all, at least $37 billion in payments for weapons -- both already delivered and to be delivered -- was involved. Not a minor sum even for super-profitable companies like Lockheed, Raytheon and the like. Rumors are that corporate lobbying had its desired effect on Republican committee chairs in the House, who then in turn pressured Johnson to allow the vote on the floor. The final vote in the House was 310 to 111 with 210 Democrats joining 100 Republicans to pass the measure -- revealing that the core support for the US Military Industrial Complex in the House of Representatives is at least three-fourths (the US Senate likely even higher).\n\nSo the vote was the result of a 'parliamentary maneuver' in which all the Democrats crossed over to support the Republican Speaker of the House (who de facto switched parties for the moment). A minority of Republicans joined him. A slim majority of Republicans opposed the measure. Their opposition remains. Thus it is highly unlikely Congress will appropriate more funding for Ukraine for the rest of this year -- even when the $61 billion for weapons and Ukraine's government run out by this late summer.\n\nSo what happens if and when the $61 billion is exhausted well before the November elections?\n\nA possible answer to that question lies in the passage of a second Ukraine funding measure this past weekend.\n\nThe $61 billion was not the most important legislative action in the US House. While most of the media commentary has been on that Ukraine aid bill, hardly anything has been said in the mainstream media about another bill that the US House also passed over the weekend. This second measure has greater strategic implications for US global interests than the $37 billion in actual weapons shipments for Ukraine. This second measure is HR 8038, a 184 page bill misnamed the '21st Century Peace Through Strength Act' which amounted to yet another package (the 16th?) of US sanctions.\n\nTransferring Russia's $300 Billion Assets to Ukraine\n\nThe first section of the bill arranges a procedure for the US to force the sale of the China company, Tik Tok, to a consortium of US financial investors, reportedly led by former US Treasury Secretary under Trump, Steve Mnuchin. This is part of the expanding list of sanctions on China. Also sanctioned are China purchases of Iranian oil, as well as a host of additional sanctions on Iran itself. However the most significant measure related to sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe 21st Century Peace Through Strength Act calls for the US to transfer its $5 billion share of Russia's $300 billion of seized assets in Western banks that were frozen in 2022 at the outset of the Ukraine war. It provides a procedure to hand over the $5 billion to Ukraine to further finance its war efforts! This move has been rumored and debated in the USA and Europe since the assets were seized two years ago. But now the process of actually transferring the seized funds to Ukraine has begun with the passage of this second bill by the US House.\n\nThe USA's $5 billion share in US banks is just a drop in the bucket of the $300 billion. Russia could probably care less about it, i.e. a mere 'rounding error' in its total revenue from sale of oil, gas and other commodities. But Europe holds $260 of the $300 billion, according to European Central Bank chair, Christine Lagarde. A tidy sum which Russia has threatened to retaliate against Europe should the EU follow the US/Biden lead and also begin to transfer its $260 billion to Ukraine.\n\nThe US bill is very clear that the transfer of the US's $5 billion is imminent. The bill requires the Biden administration to establish a 'Ukraine Defense Fund' into which the US's $5 billion will be deposited. If parts of the $5 billion are not in liquid asset form, the US president is further authorized by the bill to liquidate those assets and deposit the proceeds in the fund as well. So the seizure and transfer of the $5 billion to Ukraine is a done deal. And when it happens a legal precedent will be made that Europe may use to follow and transfer its $260 billion.\n\nOne can expect the US to pressure Europe strongly to do so. Biden is further authorized by the bill to 'negotiate' with Europe and other G7 partners to convince them to do the same -- i.e. seize their share of the $300 billion, liquidate and then transfer the cash assets into the US 'Ukraine Defense Fund'. And to date the US has been able to 'convince' Europe -- via its control of NATO and influence over Europe's economy and its umbrella political elites in the European Commission and European Parliament -- to follow US policy without too much resistance.\n\nEurope is fast becoming an economic satrapy and political dependency of the USA in recent decades, more than willing to bend in whatever policy direction the USA wants.\n\nIt is clear the seizure & redistribution to Ukraine of the $300 billion via the Ukraine Defense Fund is the means by which the US/NATO plan longer term to continue to finance the Ukraine war after the $61 billion runs out sometime in 2024; and certainly in 2025 and beyond. For the US has no intention of ending its NATO led proxy war in Ukraine anytime soon. It is just seeking to 'buy time' in the interim before its November elections.\n\nFor a majority of both parties in the US -- Democrat and Republican -- are united on continuing the war. It will matter little who wins the presidency or which party has majorities in Congress after November. Political elites on both sides of the aisle in Congress are united in pursuing the war in Ukraine -- just as they are united in continuing to fund Israel as well as to continue the US's steadily expanding economic war with China. In just the past week it is obvious more US sanctions on China are also coming soon, including possibly an announcements of financial sanctions on China for the first time after US Secretary of State, Blinken's, most recent visit.\n\nFailed Russian Sanctions: Past and Future\n\nThe geopolitical objectives of the US and its commitment to continuing its three wars are resulting in unintended, negative effects on the economies of the US and its G7 allies, especially Germany. But those same sanctions have had little to no negative impact on Russia's economy.\n\nThe recently passed US transfer of its $5 billion share of Russia's $300 billion will accelerate the negative consequences especially for Europe should the latter follow the US lead and distribute its $260 billion share to Ukraine, which it eventually will.\n\nAs EBC chairperson, Lagarde, put it referring to the US plan and legislation: \"It needs to be carefully considered\". UK political leaders are already on record advocating the confiscation and transferring of Europe's $260 billion holdings of Russian assets to Ukraine. Europe in recent years has a strong history of capitulating to US economic policies and demands. It will be no different this time.\n\nShould Europe join the USA in transferring its $260 billion share of Russian assets in European banks (most of which is in Belgium), it's almost certain that Russia will reply similarly and seize at least an equal amount of European assets still in Russia. The Russian Parliament has officially recently said as much.\n\nPart of the G7/NATO sanctions to date included forcing Western businesses in Russia to liquidate and leave Russia. Some have done so. But many have not. Russia's response has been to arrange the transfer of those EU companies' assets that have left to Russian companies. This has actually stimulated the Russian economy. It resulted in Russian government subsidies -- and thus government spending -- to Russian companies assuming the assets, as well as additional investment by those companies after their acquisition of the departed EU companies' assets.\n\nIn short, Western sanctions measure pressuring Western companies to leave Russia has backfired in its predicted result of reducing Russian government spending and business investment.\n\nIn contrast, the US/NATO's 15 or so sanctions packages to date have had little, if any, impact on Russia's economy since the commencing of the war in February 2022. To cite just a few of the performance of Russia's key economic indicators under the sanctions regime: see this (note: all following data is from the US global research source).\n\nRussia's GDP in the latest six months has risen between 4.9% (3rd quarter 2023) and 5.5% (4th quarter). Russia's PMI statistics show robust expansion for both manufacturing and services during the same period while in most of the major European economies both PMI indicators are contracting. Wage growth in Russia over the six months has averaged 8.5% for both quarters (whereas in the US is it less than half that and in Germany less than 1%).\n\nRussian government revenues rose from roughly 5 trillion rubles in the third quarter to 8.7 trillion in the 4th. Military expenditures are up from $69.5 billion (dollars) to $86.3 billion. Consumer spending is at record levels in the latest quarter. Russian household debt as a percent of GDP remains steady at around 22% (whereas in the USA it is 62.5%). Crude oil production and general exports continue to steadily rise. Gasoline remains at 60 cents a liter (whereas in US five-six times that and in Europe more than ten times). And the unemployment rate in Russia remains steady at 2.9% (whereas in the US and Europe it's a quarter to a half higher). Interest rates and inflation are higher in Russia but that represents an economy firing on all economic cylinders and is not necessarily a negative.\n\nIn short, it's hard to find a single statistic that shows the Russian economy has been negatively impacted by the US/NATO sanctions regime over the past two years. Indeed, an argument can even be made the sanctions have stimulated the Russian economy not undermined it.\n\nThe latest sanction in the form of the US and G7 transfer of the $300 billion in seized Russian assets in western banks will almost for certain have a similar effect on Russia's economy. Namely, distributing the $300 billion will result in Russian government seizure of at least an equivalent of European companies' assets still in Russia. And that will provide funding for still further government subsidy spending benefiting Russian companies followed by more private investment.\n\nIs the US Empire Shooting Itself in the Foot?\n\nBut there is an even greater consequence to follow the US and Europe's desperate act of transferring Russia's $300 billion in assets in Western banks to Ukraine.\n\nWestern bankers, economic policymakers, and many economists alike have warned against the seizure and transfer of the $300 billion. Heads of US and other central banks, CEOs of large commercial banks, and even mainstream economists like Shiller at Yale have continually warned publicly that transferring the assets will seriously undermine faith in the US dollar system which is the lynchpin of the US global economic empire.\n\nWhat countries in the global South will now want to put (or leave) their assets in Western banks, especially in Europe, if they think the assets could be seized should they disagree on policies promoted by the empire? It's clear the US has now begun to impose 'secondary' sanctions on countries that don't abide by its primary sanctions on Russia. Will the US also seize the assets of these 'secondary' countries now in Western banks if they don't go along with refusing to trade with Russia? And what about China, as the US has now begun to expand its sanctions -- primary and secondary -- on that country as well? Watch for unprecedented financial sanctions on China that may be forthcoming following Blinken's visit to China this week.\n\nThe US does not realize this is not the 1980s. The global south has developed massively in recent decades. They are insisting on more independence and more say in the rules of the empire -- without which they will simply leave now that an alternative is beginning to appear in the expansion of the BRICS countries.\n\nRecently expanded to 10 members (all of which in the middle east and heavily oil producers), no fewer than 34 more countries have now petitioned to join the BRICS. Furthermore, it is reported that at the BRICS next conference in late 2024 an 'alternative global financial framework' will be announced! That will likely include some alternative currency arrangement as well as an alternative international payments system to replace the US SWIFT system (by which the USA via its banks can see who is violating its sanctions). Likely forthcoming will be something to replace the US-run IMF in order to ensure currency stability and an expansion of China's Belt & Road as an alternative to the US run World Bank. (Perhaps that is the real topic of Blinken's forthcoming China visit?)\n\nIn short, the US global economic empire is entering its most unstable period. And yet US policy is to accelerate alternatives to it by seizing and transferring funds to Ukraine to continue the war! The blowback from the seizure and transfer will prove significant, both to US and European interests. It will render past resistance to US sanctions pale in comparison.\n\nHow to Crash an Empire!\n\nHistory will show that US geopolitical objectives and strategies in the 21st century were the single greatest cause of the decline of US global economic hegemony over the last quarter century. Much of those objectives and strategies have been the work of the most economically ignorant foreign policy team in US history, who are generally referred to as the Neocons.\n\nThe seizure and transfer of the $300 billion may provide a way to continue funding Ukraine in the US/NATO proxy war against Russia through 2024 and beyond. But the timing could not be worse for US/Europe imperial interests, coming on the eve of the historic BRICS conference later this year. The desperate act of seizure and transfer will only convince more countries of the global South to seek another more independent alternative by joining the BRICS, or increasingly trade with that bloc.\n\nHistory shows empires rest ultimately on economic foundations. And they collapse when those underlying economic foundations fracture and then crumble.\n\nThe longer run consequence of the $300 billion transfer and the exiting of the global South from the US empire can only be the decline in the use of the US dollar in global transactions and as a reserve currency. That sets in motion a series of events that in turn undermine the US domestic economy in turn: Less demand for the dollar results in a fall in the dollar's value. That means less recycling of dollars back to the US, resulting in less purchases of US Treasuries from the Federal Reserve, which in turn will require the Fed to raise long term interest rates for years to come in order to cover rising US budget deficits. All this will happen to an intensifying fiscal crisis of the US state rapidly deteriorating already.\n\nIn other words, blowback on the US economy from declining US global hegemony -- exacerbated by sanctions in general and seizure of countries like Russia's assets in particular -- is almost certain in the longer run, just as it will be for Europe's economy in the even more immediate term.\n\nBut such is the economic myopia of the US neocons and the incompetent political elite leadership in both parties in the USA in recent years. As that other American saying goes: 'We have found the enemy and they are us!'\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

tracker - Manila Standard", "body": "PARIS - The new US package of $61 billion in aid for Ukraine will not bring the war-battered country out of the woods, according to the Kiel Institute, which has been tracking the help provided by Kyiv's allies.\n\n\"This is sorely needed support, but in the grand scheme of things it is not a game changer and will only provide temporary relief,\" said Christoph Trebesch, head of the Ukraine Support Tracker at the German think tank, which published its latest update Thursday.\n\n\"Should the US pass no further support packages in late 2024 or 2025, Ukraine is very likely to face the same gap in support in 2025,\" he said.\n\nDuring months of blockage of the package in the US Congress, Ukrainian forces have run short of ammunition and have suffered battlefield setbacks.\n\nBy Feb. 29, the European Union, other members of the NATO alliance and countries such as Australia and Japan had come up with 112 billion euros ($120 billion) in military aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion of February 24, 2022, according to the Kiel Institute's update -- compiled before the latest US aid was unblocked.\n\nThe European Union and its member states have pledged 52.4 billion euros, but over a period of several years.\n\nThe United States had meanwhile provided 43.2 billion euros that has already been allocated.\n\nAfter months of blockage in Congress, President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed legislation authorising $61 billion in economic and military aid for Ukraine, with the Pentagon quickly announcing a new $1 billion package headed for Kyiv including desperately needed air defence and artillery munitions.\n\nThe Kiel Institute said the new US package contained approximately 23 billion euros in military aid.\n\nIn February, EU leaders overcame months of opposition from Hungarian leader Viktor Orban to agree 50 billion euros of aid for Ukraine.\n\nBut earlier this month the bloc frustrated Ukraine's plea for more air defense capabilities by failing to come up with concrete commitments.\n\nUkraine has asked for seven additional US-made Patriot air defense systems, which are capable of shooting down Russia's hypersonic missiles.\n\nSo far only Germany has answered Kyiv's call by saying it would send an extra Patriot system to Ukraine.\n\nSeveral EU nations possess the systems, including Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe West's weapon contributions have evolved along with the situation on the battlefield, morphing from tens of thousands of light weapons after the start of the invasion to helicopters and howitzers, and then to sophisticated western tanks including American Abrams, British Challengers and German Leopards.", "source": {"uri":

President Joe Biden is expected to quickly sign it into law, ending a monthslong impasse over a military aid package that Ukraine in particular desperately needs. (N.Y. Times)\n\nThe authorization of the aid package puts an end to an episode that highlighted the willingness and ability of a small coterie of Republican extremists to paralyze U.S. action on a key national security interest: helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion. But it leaves key questions unanswered, both with regard to U.S. foreign policy, and Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield.\n\nTo begin with, it's still uncertain what drove Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, a conservative Republican, to buck the Trump-aligned faction on the military aid bill by passing it with the help of Democratic legislators. So it remains to be seen whether this sets a precedent for when divisive issues of foreign and defense policy come before the House in the future.\n\nSecond, while Ukraine will be relieved to receive the military aid, it comes after months of attrition in the face of relentless Russian attacks. So it's also an open question whether the aid, when it finally arrives at the front lines, will be enough to reverse the momentum in Ukraine's favor.\n\nFinally, the combined package highlights the many cross-cutting divisions among the U.S. electorate over different aspects of Washington's security commitments to its allies and partners. While the MAGA wing of the Republican Party opposed further military aid to Ukraine, the left wing of the Democratic Party expressed similar misgivings about the part of the package earmarked for Israel against the backdrop of the war in Gaza. Though there were bipartisan majorities for both packages, they may come with political costs for Johnson as well as Biden in the months ahead.\n\nThe World Bank has suspended $150 million in funding for a tourism project in a remote part of southern Tanzania due to the project's effects on local communities. The move comes after a California-based human rights group, the Oakland Institute, released a report in November that detailed abuses by Tanzanian authorities during efforts to expand Ruaha National Park.\n\nThe effects of tourism on local communities is not just a problem for Tanzania. As Samira Sawlani wrote in July 2022, a new wave of activists is challenging Kenya's approach to wildlife conservation and the related tourist industry as well.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry announced that it has suspended consular services for military-age men living outside Ukraine. Men between the ages of 18 and 60 who have left the country will be unable to renew passports and access other services for citizens abroad. The policy is in keeping with a recent law meant to expand the pool of men in Ukraine available to fight.\n\nSuch laws are controversial because it's not clear they solve the problem they are meant to address, and they create new ones. As Charli Carpenter wrote in August, Ukraine has more volunteers for military service than it is able to train, and the inability of men to leave the country for work can harm families, leading most women to oppose such laws.", "source": {"uri": "worldpoliticsreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Politics Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

President Volodymyr Zelensky had been pleading for this money for months, warning that \"if Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war.\"\n\nWashington is Kyiv's main military supporter, but before this week, Congress had not passed a major aid package for its ally since December 2022 due to partisan squabbling.\n\nUkrainian rescuers clear the rubble of a destroyed building following a missile attack in Chernigiv on April 17, 2024\n\nThe bill provides nearly $14 billion to train, equip and finance the needs of the Ukrainian army.\n\nUkraine will also receive $10 billion in \"forgivable loans\" for vital economic and budgetary support, including for the energy and infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe idea of a loan, rather than a grant, was suggested by former president Donald Trump, who believes the United States should stop handing out money without any payback. A \"forgivable loan\" can be partly or fully forgiven or deferred under certain conditions.\n\nA large chunk of this money will also go to replenishing US military stockpiles.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the US president to confiscate and sell Russian assets in order to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, an idea that is also gaining traction with other G7 countries.\n\n- Israel -\n\nPeople inspect the wreckage of a partially-collapsed building in Gaza City\n\nThe United States' historic ally Israel will receive $13 billion in military assistance as it fights Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThese funds will be used in particular to strengthen Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.\n\nMore than $9 billion will be spent to address \"the dire need for humanitarian assistance for Gaza as well as other vulnerable populations around the world.\"\n\nThe measure, however, prohibits any direct US funding of the UN crisis-hit Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). Israel has accused some of the agency employees in Gaza of involvement in the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which triggered the war.\n\n- Taiwan, TikTok -\n\nThe bill provides some $8 billion to counter China through investment in submarine infrastructure and boosting competition with Chinese projects in developing countries.\n\nNo caption\n\nIt also earmarks several billion dollars in weapons funding for Taiwan, a self-ruled island that is claimed by China.\n\nAnother bill passed in the package could force TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a nationwide ban in the United States.\n\nAmerican officials have voiced alarm over the popularity of the video-sharing app with young people, alleging that it is subservient to Beijing and a conduit to spread propaganda, claims denied by the company and Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The upcoming tranche of aid will be significantly larger than the Pentagon's usual $300 million package, one of the officials said, along with a third U.S. official with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe Pentagon intends to deliver a \"big package to help meet Ukraine's battlefield needs,\" one of the officials told Politico.\n\nU.S. officials believe Ukraine's hope of a military victory against Russia is dwindling, and Kyiv could face defeat by the end of the year if its backers do not surge much-needed equipment, Politico reported.

Two admin officials have told Reuters that the first single new package is expected to be valued at $1 billion.\n\nThe White House said in a readout of Biden's Monday call with Zelensky wherein the latter thanked the US for the new assistance: \"President Biden shared that his administration will quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law.\"\n\nInterestingly (and alarmingly, given the cross-border escalation with Russia soon to follow), Zelensky touted that the new bill also included provisions for Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) with a range of about 190 miles. \"In the agreement on ATACMS for Ukraine, all the details are in place,\" Zelensky said. \"Thank you, Mr. President, thank you Congress, thank you America.\"\n\nThe $61 billion marked for Ukraine, among a broader final package totaling $95 billion (the rest for Israel and Taiwan), is now set for a vote in the Senate on Tuesday. \"The task before us is urgent. It is once again the Senate's turn to make history,\" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell stated while previewing the vote.\n\nBiden told Zelensky that he could expect the military assistance to arrive \"quickly\" - at a moment Ukrainian cities and especially energy and communications infrastructure are getting pounded. One question that remains is how much of the $61 billion is going straight to major US defense contractors, as they work speedily to prepare more military hardware to be shipped out the door.\n\nMeanwhile, the southern port city of Odesa was pummeled overnight, and there are reports of Russian drones having been fired on the capital of Kiev as well:\n\nAt least nine people have been injured after an overnight Russian air strike on the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said. \"As a result of Russian terror, residential buildings were damaged, and there was a fire,\" Ukraine's state emergency services said on Telegram.\n\nThe day prior, stunning video emerged from Kharkiv showing a large TV tower being taken out during a Russian attack...\n\nAFP reported that an \"AFP journalist in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, saw the red-and-white spire of the 240-meter structure toppled after local officials reported a barrage by Russian forces.\"\n\nThe New York Times has recently observed that \"War in eastern Ukraine has killed tens of thousands of people, reduced cities to ruins and displaced millions of people. It has also all but destroyed the factories and plants that were for years an important driver of Ukraine's economy.\"\n\nAs for what's expected to be rushed US aid the moment Biden signs the new package into law, there are reports saying the staging has already taken place in central and eastern Europe...", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"},

Join us in this fight.\n\nThe long-awaited passing of the U.S. aid bill in the House of Representatives over the weekend was swiftly followed by a collective sigh of relief in Ukraine and among the country's allies.\n\nBut frustration at the delays caused by political infighting in Congress has not completely subsided, as Kyiv faces a precarious few weeks as it waits for critically needed weapons and ammunition to arrive.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with MSNBC on April 21, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the delay \"has had real consequences\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have now, for months, been outgunned, roughly one to five, one to 10, depending on what part of the front line you are talking about,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\n\"We have seen that fewer Russian missiles and drones have been shot down simply because they lack air defense systems and also ammunition,\" he added.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a $61 billion aid bill for Kyiv on April 20, ending months of deadlock that began nearly seven months ago.\n\nWhile it is difficult to directly attribute events in Ukraine to the delay, what is certain is the situation has significantly deteriorated on several fronts during this time. Western and Ukrainian officials, including Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, were not shy in attributing blame.\n\nWhile the front lines in Ukraine have only changed incrementally compared to earlier periods of the war, the advances that have been made have all been to Russia's advantage.\n\nDelays in U.S. aid have meant Ukraine has been firmly on the defensive, handing a theater-wide initiative to Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The aid is coming way too late, as materiel shortages resulted in Ukraine losing the initiative in October 2023,\" Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told Reuters on April 22.\n\nStepanenko added that Ukraine had lost 583 square kilometers of territory to Russian forces since then, largely due to a lack of artillery ammunition.\n\nThe most significant territorial loss for Ukraine was the city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, which fell to Russian forces on Feb. 17 following a sustained assault from Kremlin troops that lasted months.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Ukrainian withdrawal, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby warned an artillery shortage could lead to the loss of the city. After Avdiivka fell, Biden laid the blame squarely on delays in U.S. aid.\n\n\"This morning, Ukraine's military was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka after Ukrainian soldiers had to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction, resulting in Russia's first notable gains in months,\" Biden said in a statement on Feb. 17 after a call with Zelensky.\n\nDespite Russian advances, the Avdiivka campaign was also extremely costly to Russia in terms of manpower and equipment. Moscow reportedly lost over 20,000 troops, 199 tanks, and 481 armored fighting vehicles in that sector in January and February 2024 alone.\n\nRussia's attempts to take Ukrainian territory have continued as they attempt to take advantage of the lag between the aid bill passing, and the aid actually arriving on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine's military said on April 22 that around 20,000 to 25,000 Russian soldiers are currently trying to storm Chasiv Yar and the settlements in the town's outskirts.\n\nDuring the autumn and winter of 2022-23, Russia nearly achieved its goal of destroying the energy infrastructure in Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv.\n\nThe campaign was one of the major factors that led to an increase in Western-supplied air defense systems, including the U.S.-made Patriot.\n\nFor much of the rest of 2023, numerous Russian aerial attacks on Kyiv were successfully thwarted.\n\nMass concentrations of drones and missiles led to many a sleepless night for residents, but the explosions that kept them awake were the sounds of the projectiles being intercepted and destroyed by the new air defenses.\n\nSince the beginning of 2024, it has been a very different story. Russia's mass missile and drone attacks, while less frequent, have been far more destructive as Ukraine ran low on the ammunition needed for its air defense systems.\n\nNowhere was this illustrated more starkly than on April 11, when the Trypillia Thermal Power Plant in the city of Ukrainka in Kyiv Oblast was completely destroyed.\n\nIn an interview on April 16, Zelensky made clear why four of the 11 missiles fired at the plant successfully struck it.\n\n\"Why? Because there were zero missiles. We have run out of all the missiles that protected the Trypillia TPP,\" the president said.\n\nOther Ukrainian cities less defended than Kyiv have fared even worse. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on April 17 that he believes his city is at risk of becoming \"a second Aleppo\" if left without help to obtain air defense systems.\n\nRussia recently intensified attacks against Kharkiv, which had a population of 1.4 million in 2021, with the use of missiles, glide bombs, and drones, destroying energy infrastructure and killing civilians.\n\nIn March, attacks reportedly damaged or completely destroyed 80% of the thermal generating capacity of DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company.\n\nOn April 23, Ukraine's state-owned energy operator Ukrenergo said the country faces power deficits caused by Russian attacks on its energy system, forcing Kyiv to temporarily restrict power supply to businesses and industrial facilities.\n\nWhile it is difficult to directly attribute civilian deaths to the delay in U.S. aid, data from the UN Human Rights Office shows the general trend of declining deaths and injuries ticked up again in December and January, coinciding with Russia's increasingly effective missile and drone attacks.\n\nUN figures do not include deaths and injuries in occupied Ukraine and the real figures are almost certainly far higher throughout the war.\n\nThe UN also reported that at least 604 Ukrainian civilians had been killed or injured in March, a 20% uptick from the month before.\n\nAs for deaths on the battlefield, there is no public data on the number of Ukrainian troops killed while the U.S. aid bill was being debated, but Zelensky said in February the total since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion was around 31,000.\n\nThere have been no official figures since, but one thing that is certain is that more Ukrainian soldiers continue to be killed on the battlefield the longer the war goes on.\n\nOne of them was Pavlo Petrychenko.\n\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Petrychenko was a renowned Kyiv activist who fought for the prosecution of corrupt Ukrainian officials.\n\nHe joined the military two months into the war and was one of the soldiers who liberated part of southern Kherson Oblast during the counteroffensive in the fall of 2022.\n\nPetrychenko was among the troops who had liberated part of southern Kherson Oblast in the fall of 2022 and participated in the heavy fighting in eastern Donetsk Oblast.\n\nWhile he fighting he still managed to maintain his activism, creating a petition to ban online gambling and access to online casinos for military personnel during martial law, something he said was having a negative effect on some soldiers.\n\nIt worked - after gaining the necessary signatures, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on April 20 to restrict online gambling in Ukraine, including a ban for the military until the end of martial law.\n\nTragically, Petrychenko didn't leave to see this - on April 15, just a day before his 32nd birthday, he was killed in combat in Donetsk Oblast.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news",

We tell our adversaries, don't mess with us,\" Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell told the Senate ahead of the vote that the world was watching to see how lawmakers would act.\n\n'History will record that even as allies and partners may have worried about the depth of our resolve, even as Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran grew more convinced that our influence had run its course, and even as loud voices here at home insisted on abandoning the responsibilities of leadership, America stepped up,' McConnell said.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also thanked lawmakers for passing the security aid bill, calling the package \"a clear testament to the strength of our alliance and sends a strong message to all our enemies.\"\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

The upcoming package will finance the replenishment of U.S. stockpiles as well as procuring new equipment to deliver to Kyiv.\n\nThe Senate will vote on the foreign aid package Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, according to CNN. It is expected to pass easily.\n\nBiden shared with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the administration will \"quickly provide significant new security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the Senate passes the national security supplemental and he signs it into law\" on a call Monday, according to a White House readout.\n\nA top Pentagon official also told lawmakers the package would be ready \"within a week or two\" after the president approves the aid funding, Politico reported.\n\nFunding for Ukraine dried up in December.

The Pentagon, expecting lawmakers to end their impasse, signaled in recent days that it was prepared to send at least some of that resupply to the battlefield within days.\n\nPresident Biden, in remarks Wednesday morning, announced that shipments would begin in the coming hours, blaming Republican lawmakers for delays in aid that had already flowed in in the tens of billions since early 2022.\n\nAs MAGA Republicans blocked aid, Ukraine ran out of shells and ammunition, Biden said, adding that Moscow's allies in China, Iran and North Korea helped keep troops in Russians in combat with weapons and equipment.\n\nRenewed aid alone is unlikely to tip the scales in kyiv's favor. But the injection of artillery ammunition, in particular, will be welcome at the front, where Ukrainian army units forced to ration their dwindling stocks have hunkered down and sought to slow Russia's advance. Western-supplied howitzers were used to help blunt efforts to break through their lines and pin down the Russian formations. Ukrainian troops also used U.S.-supplied rocket artillery to destroy command posts and equipment beyond the front lines.\n\nReplenishing Ukraine's air defenses will help protect its battered cities and infrastructure, which have been the target of relentless Russian missile and drone attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia, aided by replacement of personnel and its own resupply of equipment, advanced slowly into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, consolidating around the town of Chasiv Yar. Capturing Chasiv Yar would allow Moscow's forces to launch attacks from high ground, threatening major cities important to Ukraine's defense and supplies.\n\nU.S. officials said they anticipated a difficult year ahead, in which Ukraine would seek to hold back Russian forces while preparing its own units to resume the offensive in the future. They say kyiv's priorities include controlling disputed areas in the country's north and east, maintaining its Black Sea trade route and diminishing Moscow's ability to attack from the south by keeping it at risk. the Crimean peninsula occupied by Russia.\n\nWhile Moscow has rebuilt its forces and put pressure on Ukrainian positions on several fronts, its armies appear unable to make any significant breakthrough. For example, Russian troops failed to seize the initiative and penetrate further into Ukrainian lines after capturing the key town of Avdiivka earlier this year, an administration official said.\n\nYet kyiv's setbacks on the battlefield, some of which were partly due to an assistance shortfall, suggest modest expectations from Washington.\n\nI don't think Ukraine is in a position where it is likely to regain significant territory in the coming months, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nThe parcel inventory highlights Ukraine's urgent and enduring needs. The United States will provide Stinger air defense munitions and other munitions, including anti-ship missiles, which the Ukrainians modified so they could be launched from Soviet systems. The Pentagon will also ship Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Armored Personnel Carriers and Humvees.\n\nThe resupply of anti-armor weapons will come at a particularly crucial time, as Russian forces have advanced and made tactical adjustments along the front lines. More vehicles were used in assaults on Ukrainian positions compared to six months ago, a deputy battalion commander near Chasiv Yar recently told The Washington Post.\n\nThe US package includes TOW missiles, which can be used with fixed launchers or atop vehicles. It also includes Swedish-made Javelin anti-tank missiles and AT-4 anti-armor systems, which can help provide multi-layered defenses against Russian armored incursions.\n\nOther assistance includes small arms ammunition, including .50 caliber rounds to shoot down drones, support vehicles to transport equipment and night vision devices, and spare parts and training ammunition.\n\nThe new US aid package is one of the largest the United States has provided to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began in early 2022. The latest arms transfer from Washington, totaling $300 million, was established in March after the Pentagon identified unanticipated cost savings in recent years. arms contracts.\n\nThe $61 billion for Ukraine newly authorized by Congress funds the Department of Defense to consolidate and ship weapons, munitions and equipment from existing U.S. military stockpiles, then to replenish those stocks with new purchases from national companies. It also includes funds to directly purchase weapons for kyiv.\n\nMissy Ryan contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri":

United States is the first to acknowledge that its long-awaited $61 billion aid package for Ukraine is not a \"silver bullet.\"\n\nAs weapons and ammunition are rushed to the country, other issues such as manpower shortages in Kyiv's struggling military have come to the fore.\n\nMeanwhile, the monthslong delay in passing the aid package -- caused by wrangling among US lawmakers -- has further weakened Ukraine's position on the battleground, according to analysts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who quickly signed the law Wednesday after it passed Congress, said the bill \"should have gotten there sooner.\"\n\nJake Sullivan, his National Security Advisor, said the aid package \"will make a difference,\" but warned \"there is no silver bullet in this conflict.\"\n\n\"One capability is not going to be the ultimate solution,\" Sullivan told a White House briefing, though he added \"Ukraine's position in this conflict will improve and we believe that Ukraine can and will win.\"\n\nKyiv has been heavily reliant on billions of dollars of US military aid in its war with Russia following Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nBut in recent months Ukrainian forces -- outgunned and outmanned -- have struggled to hold back Russian troops.\n\nAnd in the United States -- Ukraine's largest provider of military assistance -- a bogged-down Congress had not approved large-scale funding for Kyiv since December 2022 before the new package was passed this week.\n\nIt contains nearly $14 billion to train, equip and finance the needs of the Ukrainian army.\n\n- Manpower shortage -\n\nGarret Martin, of the American University School of International Service in Washington, said the delay by US lawmakers in passing the aid package \"had a cost.\"\n\n\"The aid can shore up Ukraine but it's not a magic wand that could fix all the challenges they face,\" Martin said.\n\n\"What the package cannot do is deal with the shortage of manpower,\" he added.\n\nBiden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky have discussed the manpower issue, according to the White House.\n\nIn April, Kyiv reduced the minimum age for military conscription from 27 to 25, making thousands more men eligible for the draft.\n\nAnd this week, it stopped issuing new passports abroad to military-aged Ukrainian men, as part of measures to push them to return home and fight.\n\nMax Bergmann, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the impact of American aid would depend on European efforts.\n\n\"European nations need to ramp up (weapons) production now,\" Bergmann said.\n\n\"Europe's goal should be to put itself in a position to potentially fill a future gap left by the United States should it not pass another supplemental.\"\n\nBergmann said that Ukraine should use 2024 to \"hold the line, exhaust and attrit Russian forces,\" with next year possibly presenting an opportunity for a Kyiv offensive.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

The House of Representatives passed the measure on April 20, 2024, after months of disputes. This funding will be used to replenish Pentagon stocks already supplied to Ukraine, as well as to send new weapons and equipment. It will include Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV), M113 Armored Personnel Carriers (APC), and essential air defenses and artillery.\n\nFollow Army Recognition on Google News at this link\n\nIn January 2024, 186 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles were sent to Ukraine (Picture source: Ukrainian MoD)\n\nThis represents a significant increase compared to the most recent tranche of $300 million. In March, Department of Defense officials gathered $300 million in savings from previous contracts to send an emergency package to Kyiv, including desperately needed artillery and air defenses, as well as long-range missiles.\n\nHowever, not all of this amount is directly allocated to Ukraine. More than a third of the amount of $23.2 billion is dedicated to replenishing the U.S. military's weapons and ammunition systems. Nearly $14 billion is earmarked to allow Ukraine to rearm by purchasing equipment and munitions from the American defense industry, while nearly $15 billion will be devoted to support services such as military training and intelligence sharing.\n\nThe new package will include armored vehicles, including Bradley fighting vehicles and older M113 armored personnel carriers, as well as missiles, although it is not specified which type, though it may notably include Patriot missiles.\n\nThe Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) and the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) are two cornerstone vehicles in the U.S. military's mechanized infantry arsenal. The Bradley is designed to transport infantry or scouts with armor protection while providing covering fire to suppress enemy troops and armored vehicles. Equipped with a 25mm cannon, TOW anti-tank missiles, and a machine gun, it combines firepower, mobility, and protection for troops on the battlefield. The M113, an older yet versatile vehicle, is primarily used to transport troops but has been adapted for various other military roles. It features aluminum armor that offers protection against small arms fire and shrapnel, and is valued for its ability to be airlifted and its amphibious capabilities, making it highly flexible in a wide range of operational environments.\n\nMoreover, according to a POLITICO report from April 20, 2024, the United States is considering sending up to 60 military advisors to Kyiv to facilitate incoming weapons transfers while supporting the Ukrainian government. These advisors would be in a non-combat role.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, this new tranche of aid, which still requires final approval from President Joe Biden, should be ready shortly after the signing of a bill authorizing additional financial support for Kyiv. This funding will be used to replenish Pentagon stocks already supplied to Ukraine, as well as to send new weapons and equipment.\n\nDuring a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on April 22, 2024, Biden promised to quickly provide \"significant security assistance packages to meet Ukraine's urgent battlefield and air defense needs.\" Celeste Wallander, the Assistant Secretary of the Pentagon for International Security Affairs, informed legislators that the aid transfer is scheduled \"within a week or two\" after its approval.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have recently warned that Russia is gaining ground as Ukrainian soldiers run out of ammunition on the front lines, CIA Director Bill Burns informed legislators last week that without new U.S. weapons, Ukraine could lose by the end of the year.\n\nSince the beginning of the Russian invasion, the United States has significantly enhanced Ukraine's air defenses, providing systems such as the Patriot, NASAMS, HAWK, and various missiles suitable for air defense, including the AIM-7, RIM-7, and AIM-9M.

It cannot win militarily in any way, it can win politically, though,\" Grieco said. \"It can actually gain a political victory by not allowing Putin to achieve his main goal, which is to subjugate Ukraine,\" she said, noting that \"Ukraine can remain a viable state and an independent state from Russia.\"\n\nBoth Grieco and Kavanagh emphasized the importance of Ukraine showing up to the negotiating table and using diplomacy with Russia to prevent further land losses.\n\nOther experts, as well as Ukrainian officials, are critical of calls for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and have said that Vladimir Putin would demand the \"demilitarization\" of Ukraine in order to take advantage of it.\n\nExperts of the Washington-based Institute of the Study of War said in a March report that they continue to \"assess that Russian President Vladimir Putin maintains his maximalist objectives in Ukraine, which are tantamount to complete Ukrainian and Western capitulation, and that Russia has no interest in good-faith negotiations with Ukraine.\"\n\nISW has challenged the notion that the war is '\"unwinnable\" for Ukraine, calling that a Russian information operation.\n\nUkraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba has said that Russia cannot be trusted, a reality he says is proven by its documented failures to live up to past negotiations.\n\nHe reminded the world last November in a statement on social media that \"Putin is a habitual liar who promised international leaders that he would not attack Ukraine days before his invasion in February 2022.\" Kuleba said no one can seriously expect the Ukrainians to negotiate with Russia.\n\nThe challenge is that six months of delayed assistance have put Ukraine in a difficult position, one that may not immediately be rectified by the coming aid.\n\nDuring the panel discussion Wednesday, Kavanagh argued that starting negotiations will also buy Ukraine time as it's expected that the approved US aid will not be flowing in all at once. \"The reality is that politics is involved, which means that things won't be perfect and there will be delays,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ella_sherman@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ella Sherman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Endowment_for_International_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmytro Kuleba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/662a836d23b29110d3030d06?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

It became the first new funding approved by Congress since Republicans took control of the House in January 2023.\n\nHOW MUCH AID WOULD ISRAEL GET?\n\nThe bill provides $26.38 billion to support Israel, reimburse U.S. military operations in response to recent attacks and provide humanitarian assistance to civilian victims of conflicts worldwide, including Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nSome $5.2 billion will go toward replenishing and expanding Israel's missile and rocket defense system. Another $3.5 billion will go to purchasing advanced weapons systems, $1 billion to enhance weapons production and $4.4 billion for other supplies and services provided to Israel.\n\nThe humanitarian aid in the package totals $9.15 billion.\n\nIt prohibits funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides support to Palestinian refugees.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE INDO-PACIFIC AID BILL?\n\nThe bill would provide $8.12 billion to \"counter communist China and ensure a strong deterrence in the region\" as China flexes its military muscles.\n\nSome $3.3 billion will be allocated to developing submarine infrastructure, plus $2 billion in foreign military financing for Taiwan and other allies in the region to support them \"confronting Chinese aggression.\"\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BILL TO BAN TIKTOK?\n\nThe fourth bill combines several national security initiatives.\n\nIt gives ByteDance, the Chinese owner of the short-video social media app TikTok, up to a year to divest its U.S. assets or face a ban on its app being available in U.S. app stores or on U.S. web hosting services. That is double the six months that a bill the House passed last month would have allowed.\n\nThe 21st Century Peace through Strength Act would also allow the federal government to transfer frozen Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Iran and its oil production.\n\nIn addition, the aid package contains several measures on Iran sanctions, including two that \"could explicitly impact Iranian petroleum exports if implemented and enforced\", according to ClearView Energy Partners, a non-partisan research group. The U.S. already has numerous sanctions on Iran's oil exports over its nuclear program, but the shipments have risen amid strong demand from China.", "source": {"uri": "in-cyprus.philenews.com",

Johnson had declined to bring the aid packages to the floor for a vote for months.\n\nThe Senate initially passed a supplemental aid bill in February, as Ukraine said ammunition shortages were causing its forces to pull back in areas.\n\nThe newly passed House legislation includes $61 billion for Kyiv's defense against Moscow's invasion, as well as $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza, and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nBiden in a statement Saturday urged the Senate to \"quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law.\"\n\nThe United States may send additional military advisers to its embassy in Kyiv to advise and support the Ukrainian government and military, Pentagon spokesperson Ryder told VOA on Monday.\n\nThe troops would serve in a noncombat role to augment the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) at the embassy, Ryder said.\n\nTwo U.S. defense officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that were not finalized, said the number of advisers was \"small\" and could fluctuate slightly based on embassy requirements. A source familiar with the considerations said the number of troops was \"fewer than two dozen.\"\n\nThe troops could advise on matters such as logistics, maintenance, communications and sustainment, the defense officials added.\n\nPer the Pentagon, the ODC performs a variety of advisory and support missions and is embedded within the U.S. Embassy under the chief of the mission.", "source":

The foreign aid legislation which has been previously passed by the US Senate and held up in the Congress for the past two months has been overly taunted as the one which will change the world and remake or remould it in the image of the US as a world federation of vassals taking order from Washington. That is exactly where the Washington's delusions begin. Of the $95 billion package, $61 billion would go to funding Ukraine, even as more than $20 billion would be retained in the US to replenish the stock of her armoury that has been depleted to aid Ukraine's military requirements.\n\nThe reality however is that Ukraine war which is barely a disguised western boots on the ground in the US/EU confrontation with Russia. The pathetic sights of widespread hunt and capture of the mostly young, infirmed and even the elderly males in Ukraine to continue the NATO military confrontation with Russia is not a sustainable strategy that has any prospect of military victory.\n\nThe big question is: what would $61 billion achieve that over $300 billion combined in Western military and financial aid to Ukraine since 2022 could not achieve.\n\nAccording to the Germany-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the US had previously provided $75 billion to Ukraine. The United Kingdom has pledged nearly \u00a312 billion. European Union has reportedly committed about $93 billion to aid Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of the over hyped Ukraine's counter offensive last June with assorted Western military hardware featuring the America's Bradley, German's leopard and British Challenger tanks, the counter offensive, billed as a game changer and prelude to the western delusion of \"strategic defeat of Russia\" ended as a mere whimper with Russia not only \"burning out\" the Western hardware but making strategic gains in key battles especially in the \"meat grinder\" of Bakhmut which is now Artemousk and Avdiivka.\n\nAgainst the background of the spectacular failure ofUkraine's counter offensive, actually planned in NATO capitals and shoved down the throat of Ukraine's puppet regime and the serial battle field setbacks, the West and Kiev regime have managed to muster only few attacks targeted at civilians culminating in the heinous and terrorist attack in Moscow that killed more than 140 ordinary Russian Concert goers.\n\nWith over a $200 billion pumped to Ukraine in the past two years making no real impact on the battle field in favour of NATO and its Ukrainian boots on the ground except that regular and ordinary Ukrainians are weary, a $61 billions with over a quarter of it, staying put in the US to \"replenish depleted stocks\" will change nothing. Moscow has already scoffed at the Ukraine aid package, warning that the U.S would end up facing a loud and humiliating fiasco on a par with Vietnam and Afghanistan where Washington eventually cut and run.\n\nSober observers wonder which really game-changing will this new package be, except to prolong the war and its corollary of deaths and human sufferings.\n\nAmerican top officials have boasted of how their money and weapons are weakening their strategic adversary without a single drop of American blood. And the Kiev regime has never hidden the fact that they are fighting Western war. Some have openly said that it is not about the territory of Ukraine but the defence of western values. As it stands, there is no shenanigans in Washington that is not eagerly anticipated in Moscow and the euphoria of the paltry $61 billion dollars' baid to Ukraine would most likely falter as the previous packages. It is instructive that while American pro-war congress men and women enthusiastically waved Ukraine's flag on the floor of US congress, no cheer or excitements was noticed in the streets in Ukraine.\n\nOf the $95 billion, $26 billion would go to Israel to further embolden its war of genocide against Palestinians. The Zionist entity which had its tail tucked between her legs, when the Iranian drones and ballistic missiles came raining down recently showed that the cowardly regime who's over hyped strength has now come down to merely murdering women, children and the elderly would be energised to continue its war on Gaza.\n\nThe US and Israel have historically avoided open conflict with Iran, choosing cowardly assassinations of Iran's military leaders and scientists. The Iran drone and missiles attacks on Israel was a symbolic demonstration of Tehran's reach and a clear and definitive message that any military adventure against the Persian power will exert an unimaginable price.\n\nThe $26.1 billion has no practical implication for changing the balance of strength in the region. Washington pliant regimes in the region - Amman (Jordan), Cairo (Egypt), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) - may get sprinkles of the largesse for looking the other way as Palestine and Palestinians burn, but no strategic shift will happen in the region to put Iran at any reasonable strategic disadvantage.\n\n$8.1 billion of the foreign aid which is designated for the Indo-Pacific region is to fund strategic provocation against China, using the China'ss Taiwan domestic question as the basic instrument. In flagrant violation of the letters and spirit of \"The Three Joint Communiques\" which affirmed that there is One China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China as the basis of China-U.S bilateral cooperation, Washington has consistently and deliberately prodded a small circle of Taiwan adventurers to advocate Taiwan's Independence.\n\nWhile China is resolute that it would not tolerate \"Taiwan Independence\" the Washington has found in the subject a means of strategic provocation and irritation to Beijing. While the $8.1 billion\u00bf will do nothing to change the status quo, it makes only for a strategic irritant, with which Washington hopes to Keep Beijing distracted.\n\nWashington and its cronies in Taiwan are never in doubt about Beijing's resolve to safeguard territorial integrity and sovereignty and therefore are clearly aware of the redlines they cannot cross.\n\nThe US $95 billion foreign aid passed in the congress with fanfare and hyped media blitz has the only effect to nourish the Washington delusions that the world would pan out in her imaginations. It is difficult to know how history is taken serious in the inner recess of Washington decision-making or in the turgid European bureaucracy in Brussels but what is obvious is that high flying delusions whether of Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, Syria or the earlier forage into the Indo China to turn them to Washington and European vassals have collapsed like a pack of cards. Even in the West African Sahel region, states - Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, even Guinea and Chad - are upending long established Western political and military stranglehold and realigning themselves to the trend of emerging global multilateral order that makes for diversified partnerships.\n\nThe historical trajectories of multilateralism are undoubtedly the trend because it fits the aspirations of the majority of countries and people to build and advance inclusive global order that recognises our common humanity in the context of the diverse histories, experiences, cultures that combine to nourish the human essence.\n\nThe contemporary chaos in America's domestic political life with loud hints of fascists and extremist resurgence demonstrates the huge cost of Washington's over-stretch.... yet not much of sober introspection can be observed among mainstream American elite. Despite that historical science is not the forte of Washington elite, a fervent and sober reality check can offer a better guide than the gung ho and brash behaviour that inflect the woke trajectories of their delusions.", "source": {"uri": "blueprint.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blueprint Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

The announcement comes shortly after President Joe Biden signed a long-stalled foreign aid bill on Wednesday, which includes $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nThe \"significant new security assistance\" package covers Ukraine's \"critical security and defense needs,\" the Pentagon has said in a statement. The upcoming delivery includes assorted ammunition, namely 155mm and 105mm artillery shells, as well as 60mm mortar rounds, projectiles for HIMARS-family multiple rocket launchers, as well as various shoulder-mounted anti-tank launchers and small arms ammo.\n\nThe package also provides anti-aircraft capabilities, namely shoulder-launched Stinger missiles. The delivery will not include any munitions for Patriot anti-aircraft systems, including instead ship-borne RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and air-launched AIM-9M Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles. The munitions have been adapted during the conflict for use with Soviet-era ground-based anti-aircraft systems under the so-called FrankenSAM program.\n\nUkraine is set to receive an unspecified amount of combat hardware, including Bradley infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), Humvees, and mine resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAPs).

"Long-awaited US military aid no 'silver bullet' for Ukraine", "body": "The United States is the first to acknowledge that its long-awaited $61 billion aid package for Ukraine is not a \"silver bullet.\"\n\nAs weapons and ammunition are rushed to the country, other issues such as manpower shortages in Kyiv's struggling military have come to the fore.\n\nMeanwhile, the monthslong delay in passing the aid package -- caused by wrangling among US lawmakers -- has further weakened Ukraine's position on the battleground, according to analysts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who quickly signed the law Wednesday after it passed Congress, said the bill \"should have gotten there sooner.\"\n\nJake Sullivan, his National Security Advisor, said the aid package \"will make a difference,\" but warned \"there is no silver bullet in this conflict.\"\n\n\"One capability is not going to be the ultimate solution,\" Sullivan told a White House briefing, though he added \"Ukraine's position in this conflict will improve and we believe that Ukraine can and will win.\"\n\nKyiv has been heavily reliant on billions of dollars of US military aid in its war with Russia following Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nBut in recent months Ukrainian forces -- outgunned and outmanned -- have struggled to hold back Russian troops.\n\nAnd in the United States -- Ukraine's largest provider of military assistance -- a bogged-down Congress had not approved large-scale funding for Kyiv since December 2022 before the new package was passed this week.\n\nIt contains nearly $14 billion to train, equip and finance the needs of the Ukrainian army.\n\n- Manpower shortage -\n\nGarret Martin, of the American University School of International Service in Washington, said the delay by US lawmakers in passing the aid package \"had a cost.\"\n\n\"The aid can shore up Ukraine but it's not a magic wand that could fix all the challenges they face,\" Martin said.\n\n\"What the package cannot do is deal with the shortage of manpower,\" he added.\n\nBiden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky have discussed the manpower issue, according to the White House.\n\nIn April, Kyiv reduced the minimum age for military conscription from 27 to 25, making thousands more men eligible for the draft.\n\nAnd this week, it stopped issuing new passports abroad to military-aged Ukrainian men, as part of measures to push them to return home and fight.\n\nMax Bergmann, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the impact of American aid would depend on European efforts.\n\n\"European nations need to ramp up (weapons) production now,\" Bergmann said.\n\n\"Europe's goal should be to put itself in a position to potentially fill a future gap left by the United States should it not pass another supplemental.\"\n\nBergmann said that Ukraine should use 2024 to \"hold the line, exhaust and attrit Russian forces,\" with next year possibly presenting an opportunity for a Kyiv offensive.\n\naue/bjt/nro\n\nMore from this section\n\nImagine IT Launches Redesigned Website and Brand Identity to empower Midwest Businesses with Next Generation IT support

In January and February 2024, European countries allocated a total of about EUR 6 billion in aid to Ukraine, almost all of it for the military. This is shown in the latest update of the Ukraine Support Tracker, which tracks aid commitments through February 29, 2024. The European aid in recent months is nowhere near enough to fill the gap left by the lack of US assistance, particularly in the area of ammunition and artillery shells. The new US aid package which passed congress last weekend is therefore crucial, but not yet included in the figures.\n\nThe Ukraine Support Tracker has shifted its focus to measuring \"allocations\". These are concrete aid packages that have already been delivered or were specified for delivery. This is made possible by better and more transparent data from the governments. Due to a lack of transparency, previously the focus had to be more on \"commitments,\" meaning future promised aid, which were typically less specific.\n\n\"Europe has clearly not been able to fill the gap left by the dwindling US aid. This is especially true for ammunition, as the European defense sector has been very slow to build up production capacity. According to our preliminary assessment, the new US package contains approximately EUR 23 billion in military aid that will go to Ukraine. This is sorely needed support, but in the grand scheme of things it is not a game changer and will only provide temporary relief. Should the US pass no further support packages in late 2024 or 2025, Ukraine is very likely to face the same gap in support in 2025,\" says Christoph Trebesch, Head of the Ukraine Support Tracker on the occasion of the latest update.\n\nAs of February 29, European donors and the EU have allocated a total of EUR 89.9 billion in aid for military, humanitarian, and financial support since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago. The US has allocated EUR 67 billion. Since summer 2023, Europe's aid allocations have consistently exceeded those of the US, as the Congress has not approved any new Ukraine aid for over a year.\n\nEurope on par with US in military aid\n\nThe momentum of European aid in January and February was primarily driven by military aid. With EUR 2.4 billion, Germany has announced its largest military aid package since almost a year. These include air defense systems, 155mm artillery, and corresponding ammunition.\n\nWith EUR 0.7 billion, Sweden has allocated its largest military package ever, containing a variety of both maritime and land military equipment. Large amounts of military aid were also allocated by the Netherlands (EUR 0.5 billion) and the UK (EUR 0.4 billion).\n\nIn total, Europe's military support amounts to EUR 42 billion in terms of allocations. This is comparable to the US' allocations of EUR 43.1 billion. Overall, the two economic blocs account for over 95 percent of all military aid allocations to Ukraine amounting to around EUR 88 billion.\n\n\"Europe has caught up in recent months and is now on a par in terms of military aid. However, it has not been able to fill the large gap left by the US, especially regarding ammunitions. The new US aid package is therefore good news for Ukraine. For the remainder of 2024, Western support could again reach the levels of early and mid-2023, but major uncertainties remain on what happens after that,\" says Trebesch.\n\nThis long time without new US aid is particularly noticeable in the case of heavy ammunition, which was so far provided primarily by the US. The EU is primarily providing air defense systems, as well as howitzers and combat vehicles such as tanks.\n\n\u00ad\n\nAbout the Ukraine Support Tracker\n\nThe Ukraine Support Tracker tracks and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since January 24, 2022 (currently through February 2024). Included are 41 countries, specifically the EU member states, the other members of the G7, Australia, South Korea, Turkey, Norway, New Zealand, Switzerland, Turkey, China, Taiwan, India, and Iceland. It includes aid from the governments of these countries to the Ukrainian government; aid from the EU Commission and the European Investment Bank is listed separately; private donations or those from international organizations such as the IMF are not included in the main database. Nor does it include aid to Ukraine's neighbors, such as Moldova, or to other countries, such as for the reception of refugees.\n\nWith regard to sources, the database combines official government sources with information from international media. Aid provided in kind, such as medical supplies, food, or military equipment, is quantified on the basis of market prices or information from previous crises involving government aid. In case of doubt, upper bounds of prices are used.\n\nThe Ukraine Support Tracker is constantly being expanded, corrected, and improved. Suggestions are very welcome and can be sent to ukrainetracker@ifw-kiel.de.\n\nMore information and detailed data can be found on this webpage:

passing the aid package -- caused by wrangling among US lawmakers -- has further weakened Ukraine's position on the battleground, according to analysts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who quickly signed the law Wednesday after it passed Congress, said the bill \"should have gotten there sooner.\"\n\nJake Sullivan, his National Security Advisor, said the aid package \"will make a difference,\" but warned \"there is no silver bullet in this conflict.\"\n\n\"One capability is not going to be the ultimate solution,\" Sullivan told a White House briefing, though he added \"Ukraine's position in this conflict will improve and we believe that Ukraine can and will win.\"\n\nKyiv has been heavily reliant on billions of dollars of US military aid in its war with Russia following Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nBut in recent months Ukrainian forces -- outgunned and outmanned -- have struggled to hold back Russian troops.\n\nAnd in the United States -- Ukraine's largest provider

package cannot do is deal with the shortage of manpower,\" he added.\n\nBiden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky have discussed the manpower issue, according to the White House.\n\nIn April, Kyiv reduced the minimum age for military conscription from 27 to 25, making thousands more men eligible for the draft.\n\nAnd this week, it stopped issuing new passports abroad to military-aged Ukrainian men, as part of measures to push them to return home and fight.\n\nMax Bergmann, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the impact of American aid

gap left by the United States should it not pass another supplemental.\"\n\nBergmann said that Ukraine should use 2024 to \"hold the line, exhaust and attrit Russian forces,\" with next year possibly

This is especially the case in a conflict such as the one in Ukraine. So many factors - geopolitical, strategic and economic - can and will continue to influence the course of the war.\n\nSo it would possibly suit the situation better to describe the passage of Joe Biden's funding bill through the US Congress as providing an \"inflection point\" - although it is almost certainly too early to tell for sure. Reports from the battlefield are that Russian troops, mindful of the prospect that within months Ukraine will be able to call upon significant supplies of new equipment and ammunition, are pushing hard to take more territory as quickly as they can.\n\nBasing its assessment on geolocated footage, the Institute for the Study of War has identified Russian advances along the frontlines in the eastern Donetsk region. The ISW estimates that Russia has captured 360 sq km of territory this year. Meanwhile Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has said he believes Russia to be planning a fresh offensive in May.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine has begun to attack Russian positions deep in the rear using long-range army tactical missile systems (ATACMS) provided by the US in March. It is doing so in the knowledge that there will be much more where that came from.\n\nSince Vladimir Putin sent his war machine into Ukraine on February 24 2022, The Conversation has called upon some of the leading experts in international security, geopolitics and military tactics to help our readers understand the big issues. You can also subscribe to our fortnightly recap of expert analysis of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nSo perhaps this week has marked an inflection point in our coverage of the conflict. Last week we published a very stark piece by our regular contributors, Stefan Wolff of the University of Birmingham and Tetyana Malyarenko of the University of Odesa. The bleak headline: \"Ukraine is losing the war and the west faces a stark choice: help now or face a resurgent and aggressive Russia\" needs no explanation.\n\nWithin days, though, the blockage in Congress had been overcome and the House finally approved the provision of US$60- billion (\u00a349 billion) in military aid to Kyiv. We asked Wolff to reassess the situation in light of this development. The headline on his latest piece, \"US$60 billion in US military aid a major morale boost but no certain path to victory\" presents a more hopeful, if measured, tone.\n\nWolff identifies a development which chimes with we have already noted above: \"given that they are now secure in the knowledge that supplies arrive soon, Kyiv will be less compelled to ration ammunition as it has been forced to do recently.\" Hence the use of the precious, stockpiled, ATACMS in the past few days.\n\nRead more:\n\nUkraine war: US$60 billion in US military aid a major morale boost but no certain path to victory\n\nMeanwhile, Tatsiana Kulakevich, a scholar of international relations at the University of South Florida, believes the passage of the US president's funding bill is good for the US as well. She argues that a Russian victory in Ukraine in the absence of western - but more specifically US - assistance would send the wrong message to China which has territorial ambitions of its own. On the other hand, a Russian loss in Ukraine, aided by an engaged US and a united Europe, sends a clear message of deterrence to China.\n\nNot only that, she argued, but this aid package has its own economic benefits for the US. The $60 billion will form part of a much larger boost for US defence spending to update its own arsenal. And it's a potential win for Biden personally, as he campaigns for re-election in November. Most Americans support helping Ukraine in its fight against Putin's Russia. Being seen to act with decisive strength and determination will do his image no harm as his rival Donald Trump fights his own battles against a string of criminal charges.\n\nRead more:\n\nSenate approves nearly $61B of Ukraine foreign aid - here's why it helps the US to keep funding Ukraine\n\nOther developments in April have included a series of drone attacks in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in souteastern Ukraine. The plant was captured by Russian forces in March 2022, about a week after the invasion began and has shut down in stages since - recently the final of six reactors at European's largest nuclear plant was placed into a state of \"cold shutdown\".\n\nNow Putin wants to start the plant up again to begin generating electricity. Ross Peel, an expert in nuclear security and safeguards, particularly in war, at King's College London, explains why this is so perilous. He writes:\n\nThis would greatly increase the danger of a nuclear accident, as operating reactors allow much less time before an accident occurs if they are damaged or their safety systems are interrupted. The pressure and temperature inside an operating reactor are also much greater, creating the potential for large explosions and the widespread dispersal of radioactive material.\n\nRead more:\n\nUkraine war: Putin's plan to fire up Zaporizhzhia power plant risks massive nuclear disaster\n\nAnd Zaporizhzhia doesn't represent the only nuclear risk in Ukraine, writes Nino Antadze, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada. There are four nuclear plants in Ukraine as well as the abandoned shell of the Chernobyl plant which was the site of the worst nuclear accident in history and remains uninhabitable nearly 40 years on.\n\nTo wage war around these sites invites trouble, writes Antadze. When Chernobyl melted down in 1986, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated that radioactive fallout affected an area of 150,000 sq km in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. You have to hope Putin keeps that in mind.\n\nRead more:\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has left the entire region at a heightened risk of radioactive pollution\n\nAs campaigning season gathers momentum in Ukraine, both sides are beefing up conscription and enacting legislation to extend and toughen draft laws to get more men into uniform to boost troop numbers and relieve, in the case of Ukraine's army at least, soldiers who have been at the frontlines for more than two years.\n\nBut it's not just the two warring nations that are introducing or extending their conscription policies. A number of Nato members, including Latvia, have reintroduced conscription, and others such as Sweden and Estonia have extended it. Tony Ingesson, an expert in the politics of military decision-making at Lund University in Sweden, looks at the history of the draft - and the lengths many young people will go to to avoid it.\n\nRead more:\n\nMilitary conscription is returning to Europe, but is it really a more equal way of mobilising? What history tells us\n\nAnother country which has been watching the progress of the war in Ukraine with trepidation is Georgia, which was itself invaded in 2008 and which has two breakaway provinces, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, that have been occupied by Russian troops ever since. By and large the Georgian people actively support Ukraine or are simply opposed to the conflict. But the country's government is led by the pro-Russia Georgian Dream party.\n\nNew legislation introduced recently, the \"foreign agents\" law would mean that civil society groups and the media need register as being \"under foreign influence\" if they receive funding from abroad. It's seen as a direct attack on NGOs operating in Georgia, writes Natasha Lindstaedt, an expert in authoritarian regimes at the University of Essex, who says it's all part of the country's drift towards autocracy under Georgian Dream.\n\nA similar law was enacted in 2012 by Putin's regime in Russia. But when Georgian Dream tried to introduce a similar measure last year it triggered huge popular protests, forcing the government to drop the bill. Lindstaedt believes the law would seriously damage Georgia's prospects of becoming a member of the EU, something 80% of the country wants. So it's hard to see this law being any more popular this time around.\n\nRead more:\n\nGeorgia is sliding towards autocracy after government moves to force through bill on 'foreign agents'\n\nThis week, Russia has vetoed a US-drafted resolution in the UN security council which called on countries to prevent an nuclear arms race in outer space, prompting the US to question whether Moscow had something to hide in this regard and the rest of the world to protest that having so many nuclear weapons on Earth is bad enough as it is.\n\nFor Becky Alexis-Martin, a lecturer in peace studies and pacifist academic at the University of Bradford, this message can't be repeated too often. She sees an already dangerous world becoming ever more perilous as a result of the rising tensions between Russia and the west, the strife in the Middle East which could escalate into regional conflict and an increasingly assertive China.\n\nMeanwhile, after decades in which the threat of an all-out nuclear war seemed have dissipated, many countries are now rearming, while some new player, Iran and North Korea among them, are openly pursuing their nuclear ambitions and look close to developing their own arsenals - if indeed they don't already have them.\n\nAlexis-Martin paints a disturbing picture of a new cold war which could turn hot at any time. A war in which everyone is a loser.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew 'cold war' grows ever warmer as the prospect of a nuclear arms race hots up\n\nUkraine Recap is available as a fortnightly email newsletter.

In January and February 2024, European countries allocated a total of about EUR 6 billion in aid to Ukraine, almost all of it for the military. This is shown in the latest update of the Ukraine Support Tracker, which tracks aid commitments through February 29, 2024. The European aid in recent months is nowhere near enough to fill the gap left by the lack of US assistance, particularly in the area of ammunition and artillery shells. The new US aid package which passed congress last weekend is therefore crucial, but not yet included in the figures.\n\nThe Ukraine Support Tracker has shifted its focus to measuring \"allocations\". These are concrete aid packages that have already been delivered or were specified for delivery. This is made possible by better and more transparent data from the governments. Due to a lack of transparency, previously the focus had to be more on \"commitments,\" meaning future promised aid, which were typically less specific.\n\n\"Europe has clearly not been able to fill the gap left by the dwindling US aid. This is especially true for ammunition, as the European defense sector has been very slow to build up production capacity. According to our preliminary assessment, the new US package contains approximately EUR 23 billion in military aid that will go to Ukraine. This is sorely needed support, but in the grand scheme of things it is not a game changer and will only provide temporary relief. Should the US pass no further support packages in late 2024 or 2025, Ukraine is very likely to face the same gap in support in 2025,\" says Christoph Trebesch, Head of the Ukraine Support Tracker on the occasion of the latest update.\n\nAs of February 29, European donors and the EU have allocated a total of EUR 89.9 billion in aid for military, humanitarian, and financial support since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago. The US has allocated EUR 67 billion. Since summer 2023, Europe's aid allocations have consistently exceeded those of the US, as the Congress has not approved any new Ukraine aid for over a year.\n\nEurope on par with US in military aid\n\nThe momentum of European aid in January and February was primarily driven by military aid. With EUR 2.4 billion, Germany has announced its largest military aid package since almost a year. These include air defense systems, 155mm artillery, and corresponding ammunition.\n\nWith EUR 0.7 billion, Sweden has allocated its largest military package ever, containing a variety of both maritime and land military equipment. Large amounts of military aid were also allocated by the Netherlands (EUR 0.5 billion) and the UK (EUR 0.4 billion).\n\nIn total, Europe's military support amounts to EUR 42 billion in terms of allocations. This is comparable to the US' allocations of EUR 43.1 billion. Overall, the two economic blocs account for over 95 percent of all military aid allocations to Ukraine amounting to around EUR 88 billion.\n\n\"Europe has caught up in recent months and is now on a par in terms of military aid. However, it has not been able to fill the large gap left by the US, especially regarding ammunitions. The new US aid package is therefore good news for Ukraine. For the remainder of 2024, Western support could again reach the levels of early and mid-2023, but major uncertainties remain on what happens after that,\" says Trebesch.\n\nThis long time without new US aid is particularly noticeable in the case of heavy ammunition, which was so far provided primarily by the US. The EU is primarily providing air defense systems, as well as howitzers and combat vehicles such as tanks.\n\n\u00ad\n\nAbout the Ukraine Support Tracker\n\nThe Ukraine Support Tracker tracks and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since January 24, 2022 (currently through February 2024). Included are 41 countries, specifically the EU member states, the other members of the G7, Australia, South Korea, Turkey, Norway, New Zealand, Switzerland, Turkey, China, Taiwan, India, and Iceland. It includes aid from the governments of these countries to the Ukrainian government; aid from the EU Commission and the European Investment Bank is listed separately; private donations or those from international organizations such as the IMF are not included in the main database. Nor does it include aid to Ukraine's neighbors, such as Moldova, or to other countries, such as for the reception of refugees.\n\nWith regard to sources, the database combines official government sources with information from international media. Aid provided in kind, such as medical supplies, food, or military equipment, is quantified on the basis of market prices or information from previous crises involving government aid. In case of doubt, upper bounds of prices are used.\n\nThe Ukraine Support Tracker is constantly being expanded, corrected, and improved. Suggestions are very welcome and can be sent to ukrainetracker@ifw-kiel.de.\n\nMore information and detailed data can be found on this webpage:

Reports from the battlefield are that Russian troops, mindful of the prospect that within months Ukraine will be able to call upon significant supplies of new equipment and ammunition, are pushing hard to take more territory as quickly as they can.\n\nBasing its assessment on geolocated footage, the Institute for the Study of War has identified Russian advances along the frontlines in the eastern Donetsk region. The ISW estimates that Russia has captured 360 sq km of territory this year. Meanwhile Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has said he believes Russia to be planning a fresh offensive in May.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine has begun to attack Russian positions deep in the rear using long-range army tactical missile systems (ATACMS) provided by the US in March. It is doing so in the knowledge that there will be much more where that came from.\n\nSince Vladimir Putin sent his war machine into Ukraine on February 24 2022, The Conversation has called upon some of the leading experts in international security, geopolitics and military tactics to help our readers understand the big issues. You can also subscribe to our fortnightly recap of expert analysis of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nSo perhaps this week has marked an inflection point in our coverage of the conflict. Last week we published a very stark piece by our regular contributors, Stefan Wolff of the University of Birmingham and Tetyana Malyarenko of the University of Odesa. The bleak headline: \"Ukraine is losing the war and the west faces a stark choice: help now or face a resurgent and aggressive Russia\" needs no explanation.\n\nWithin days, though, the blockage in Congress had been overcome and the House finally approved the provision of US$60- billion (\u00a349 billion) in military aid to Kyiv. We asked Wolff to reassess the situation in light of this development. The headline on his latest piece, \"US$60 billion in US military aid a major morale boost but no certain path to victory\" presents a more hopeful, if measured, tone.\n\nWolff identifies a development which chimes with we have already noted above: \"given that they are now secure in the knowledge that supplies arrive soon, Kyiv will be less compelled to ration ammunition as it has been forced to do recently.\" Hence the use of the precious, stockpiled, ATACMS in the past few days.\n\nRead more: Ukraine war: US$60 billion in US military aid a major morale boost but no certain path to victory\n\nMeanwhile, Tatsiana Kulakevich, a scholar of international relations at the University of South Florida, believes the passage of the US president's funding bill is good for the US as well. She argues that a Russian victory in Ukraine in the absence of western - but more specifically US - assistance would send the wrong message to China which has territorial ambitions of its own. On the other hand, a Russian loss in Ukraine, aided by an engaged US and a united Europe, sends a clear message of deterrence to China.\n\nNot only that, she argued, but this aid package has its own economic benefits for the US. The $60 billion will form part of a much larger boost for US defence spending to update its own arsenal. And it's a potential win for Biden personally, as he campaigns for re-election in November. Most Americans support helping Ukraine in its fight against Putin's Russia. Being seen to act with decisive strength and determination will do his image no harm as his rival Donald Trump fights his own battles against a string of criminal charges.\n\nRead more: Senate approves nearly $61B of Ukraine foreign aid - here's why it helps the US to keep funding Ukraine\n\nThe nuclear risk\n\nOther developments in April have included a series of drone attacks in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in souteastern Ukraine. The plant was captured by Russian forces in March 2022, about a week after the invasion began and has shut down in stages since - recently the final of six reactors at European's largest nuclear plant was placed into a state of \"cold shutdown\".\n\nNow Putin wants to start the plant up again to begin generating electricity. Ross Peel, an expert in nuclear security and safeguards, particularly in war, at King's College London, explains why this is so perilous. He writes:\n\nThis would greatly increase the danger of a nuclear accident, as operating reactors allow much less time before an accident occurs if they are damaged or their safety systems are interrupted. The pressure and temperature inside an operating reactor are also much greater, creating the potential for large explosions and the widespread dispersal of radioactive material.\n\nRead more: Ukraine war: Putin's plan to fire up Zaporizhzhia power plant risks massive nuclear disaster\n\nAnd Zaporizhzhia doesn't represent the only nuclear risk in Ukraine, writes Nino Antadze, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada. There are four nuclear plants in Ukraine as well as the abandoned shell of the Chernobyl plant which was the site of the worst nuclear accident in history and remains uninhabitable nearly 40 years on.\n\nTo wage war around these sites invites trouble, writes Antadze. When Chernobyl melted down in 1986, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated that radioactive fallout affected an area of 150,000 sq km in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. You have to hope Putin keeps that in mind.\n\nRead more: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has left the entire region at a heightened risk of radioactive pollution\n\nFear and contagion\n\nAs campaigning season gathers momentum in Ukraine, both sides are beefing up conscription and enacting legislation to extend and toughen draft laws to get more men into uniform to boost troop numbers and relieve, in the case of Ukraine's army at least, soldiers who have been at the frontlines for more than two years.\n\nBut it's not just the two warring nations that are introducing or extending their conscription policies. A number of Nato members, including Latvia, have reintroduced conscription, and others such as Sweden and Estonia have extended it. Tony Ingesson, an expert in the politics of military decision-making at Lund University in Sweden, looks at the history of the draft - and the lengths many young people will go to to avoid it.\n\nRead more: Military conscription is returning to Europe, but is it really a more equal way of mobilising? What history tells us\n\nAnother country which has been watching the progress of the war in Ukraine with trepidation is Georgia, which was itself invaded in 2008 and which has two breakaway provinces, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, that have been occupied by Russian troops ever since. By and large the Georgian people actively support Ukraine or are simply opposed to the conflict. But the country's government is led by the pro-Russia Georgian Dream party.\n\nNew legislation introduced recently, the \"foreign agents\" law would mean that civil society groups and the media need register as being \"under foreign influence\" if they receive funding from abroad. It's seen as a direct attack on NGOs operating in Georgia, writes Natasha Lindstaedt, an expert in authoritarian regimes at the University of Essex, who says it's all part of the country's drift towards autocracy under Georgian Dream.\n\nA similar law was enacted in 2012 by Putin's regime in Russia. But when Georgian Dream tried to introduce a similar measure last year it triggered huge popular protests, forcing the government to drop the bill. Lindstaedt believes the law would seriously damage Georgia's prospects of becoming a member of the EU, something 80% of the country wants. So it's hard to see this law being any more popular this time around.\n\nRead more: Georgia is sliding towards autocracy after government moves to force through bill on 'foreign agents'\n\nDoomsday scenario\n\nThis week, Russia has vetoed a US-drafted resolution in the UN security council which called on countries to prevent an nuclear arms race in outer space, prompting the US to question whether Moscow had something to hide in this regard and the rest of the world to protest that having so many nuclear weapons on Earth is bad enough as it is.\n\nFor Becky Alexis-Martin, a lecturer in peace studies and pacifist academic at the University of Bradford, this message can't be repeated too often. She sees an already dangerous world becoming ever more perilous as a result of the rising tensions between Russia and the west, the strife in the Middle East which could escalate into regional conflict and an increasingly assertive China.\n\nMeanwhile, after decades in which the threat of an all-out nuclear war seemed have dissipated, many countries are now rearming, while some new player, Iran and North Korea among them, are openly pursuing their nuclear ambitions and look close to developing their own arsenals - if indeed they don't already have them.\n\nAlexis-Martin paints a disturbing picture of a new cold war which could turn hot at any time. A war in which everyone is a loser.\n\nRead more: New 'cold war' grows ever warmer as the prospect of a nuclear arms race hots up\n\nUkraine Recap is available as a fortnightly email newsletter.

The four were then combined as one in the Senate, which approved the bill 79-18 on Tuesday.\n\nAll but four of the 16-member Ohio delegation in the House and Senate approved funding for Ukraine.\n\nU.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio and U.S. Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana; Warren Davidson, R-Troy; and Troy Balderson, R-Zanesville all voted no. Davidson also opposed funding for Israel and the TikTok ban.\n\nThe rest of the Ohio delegation voted for all four bills in the House or the combined bill in the Senate, including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and local members of Congress: U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Dayton; U.S. Rep. Mike Carey, R-Columbus and U.S. Rep, Greg. Landsman, D-Cincinnati.\n\nThe bill includes $60.8 billion to assist Ukraine, with Biden on Wednesday approving a $1 billion shipment to be sent immediately, including air defense capabilities, artillery rounds, armored vehicles and other weapons, according to the Associated Press. The bill also provides $26.4 billion to Israel, humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and other conflict zones and $8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. Some of the Ukraine aid is structured as a loan that can be forgiven by the president starting in 2026.\n\nOhio manufacturers, including defense contractors in Springboro and Lima, are expected to provide some of the equipment going to Ukraine.\n\nThis newspaper asked members of the local delegation about their votes.\n\n\"The bipartisan national security package signed into law today is critical to taking on some of the biggest threats facing our country: Iran and its terrorist proxy groups, Vladimir Putin, China, and the drug cartels bringing deadly fentanyl into this country,\" said Brown. \"This law, which includes my bill to crack down on fentanyl trafficking, is a win for our national security, local law enforcement, and Ohio communities.\"\n\nIn a House floor speech supporting Ukraine funding, Turner talked about the alliance between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"When people ask why we should support Ukraine, I like to remind them of President Xi of China's trip to Russia last year,\" Turner said. \"They stood together and articulated that this is a battle between authoritarianism and democracy, and we must stand for democracy and against authoritarianism.\"\n\nDavidson issued a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"Today, the uniparty D.C. establishment spent $100 billion securing other countries' borders but could not spare a cent to secure our own,\" Davidson said. \"My constituents' hard-earned tax dollars will fund the Biden administration's missionless foreign policy agenda. Most troubling is the $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza, which we know will fund Hamas terrorists. It is a betrayal to our most important ally, Israel, as well as to the American people.\"\n\nVance talked about his opposition to the funding in a floor speech.\n\n\"You hear all the time from folks who support endless funding to Ukraine that unless we send resources to Ukraine, Vladimir Putin will march all the way to Berlin or Paris,\" Vance said, according to a transcript provided by his office. \"Well, first of all, this doesn't make any sense. Vladimir Putin can't get to western Ukraine. How is he going to get all the way to Paris? And second of all, if Vladimir Putin is a threat to Germany and France, if he's a threat to Berlin and Paris, then they should spend more money on military equipment.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lynn_hulsey@daytondailynews.com", "name": "Lynn Hulsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Carey_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Carey (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The main thing is that further deliveries take place quickly and without interruption.\n\nWe are doing our best to make up for six months of debate and polemics, which Russia used to improve its tactical position. It's time to fix the situation.\n\nNo single aid package can stop the enemy. Only the united front of all Ukraine and all its partners can stop the Russians.\n\nIn order to make the most of the opportunity, Ukrainians must make significant efforts. Partners provide a tool, but it is up to us to use it.\n\nIt is important that other partners also stepped up their support for Ukraine. Only the coalition of the entire democratic world can put an end to aggression and terror.\n\nOn April 24, the U.S. Department of Defence announced the 56th package of military aid for Ukraine in the total amount of $1 billion.\n\nU.S. has quickly prepared the first military aid package from the amount of almost $61 billion approved by Congress.\n\nThe new package was formed under the PDA program, which provides for the supply of military aid directly from the arsenals of the U.S. Armed Forces. This important tool was successfully defended against amendments during the debate in Congress.\n\nThe package contains RIM-7, AIM-9M missiles, Stinger and Javelin anti-armour systems, 155 mm artillery rounds (including cluster shells) and 105mm, ammunition for HIMARS systems, 60 mm mortar rounds, anti-armour mines, Claymore anti-personnel munitions, anti-personnel.\n\nThe new aid package will add to the fleet of Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, MRAP and Humvee armoured vehicles, logistics support vehicles, and tactical vehicles to tow and haul equipment.\n\nThis package will strengthen the capabilities of the Ukrainian Defence Forces on the battle line, where we currently have to hold back the Russian offensive in heavy battles.\n\nDuring the vote in the UN Security Council, Russia vetoed the draft resolution on the non-proliferation of weapons, including nuclear, in outer space.\n\nRussia has long demonstrated its destructive role in the UN Security Council. Due to the abuse of the Russian Federation's right of veto (obtained in a dubious way from the USSR), the main world security organization of became incapacitated.\n\nThe strange vote of the Russian Federation at the UN Security Council, regarding space, shows that Moscow may be hiding something or seeks to blackmail the international community in this way.\n\nRussia is known for its irresponsible actions in space: in November 2021, during the test of an anti-satellite rocket, a huge amount of debris was formed in orbit, which could destroy the International Space Station.\n\nIn February 2024, U.S. intelligence warned about the plans of the Russian Federation to test nuclear weapons in space.\n\nMoscow systematically resorts to nuclear blackmail in the context of the war with Ukraine and does not adhere to the principle of non-proliferation, announcing the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus.", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

The delivery also includes various anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, as well as \"demolitions munitions for obstacle clearing.\"\n\nThe package also apparently hints at ongoing preparations for the long-promised delivery of F-16 jets to Ukraine, containing such points as unspecified \"precision aerial munitions\" and \"airfield support equipment.\"\n\nThe package comes after US legislators adopted a massive $95-billion foreign aid package, that includes $61 billion for Ukraine, after months of debate in Congress. The bill was signed into law by Biden earlier in the day, with the president stating the deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Ukraine were set to resume \"in the next few hours.\"\n\nAccording to unnamed US officials cited by AP, however, some contents of the package will indeed arrive on the frontline in a matter of days, while other items listed in the Pentagon's announcement could take longer.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M114_155_mm_howitzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M114 155 mm howitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiple rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Projectile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortar (weapon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-7_Sea_Sparrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RIM-7 Sea Sparrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIM-92 Stinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AIM-9 Sidewinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humvee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MIM-104 Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MRAP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-tank mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.04/article/66294c932030274f0e7ae65f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

That's our tradition,\" Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said in a Senate speech.\n\n\"To my Republican colleagues and friends in the Senate, our tradition is much more serious.

This happened partially because the stalemate in Congress led to Ukrainian forces running low on weapons and ammunition, the sources suggested.\n\nA senior Democratic Senate aide also told Politico that the question now is whether more US aid can lead to a Ukrainian victory, or if it would just be enough to fend off Russian forces temporarily. \"There's lots of debate about what a winning endgame for Ukraine looks like at this point,\" the source said.\n\nThe outlet argued that there is a difference between Kiev \"winning\" by getting \"most or all of its territory back\" and \"not losing,\" which means that \"Ukraine can hold its lines and advance some but fail to claw back what Russia seized.\" Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's stance that Kiev should fight until it takes back all of its territory, including Crimea, \"commits the US to a much longer conflict with no guarantee Zelensky will achieve his goals,\" Politico stressed.\n\nCommenting on the $61 billion US military aid package on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted that \"all these new batches of weapons... will not change the dynamics on the front line.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said that Moscow's forces currently hold the initiative everywhere along the front line and are capturing more settlements.

President Joe Biden is expected to sign the legislation into law on Wednesday. The Senate on Tuesday evening backed the measure passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday. It includes $61bn in military aid for Ukraine, which the Pentagon says can start being delivered to the war-torn nation \"within days\". It passed in a bipartisan vote of 79-18. - BBC\n\nThe Pentagon is poised to send $1 billion in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Tuesday as the Senate moved ahead on long-awaited legislation to fund the weapons Kyiv desperately needs to stall gains being made by Russian forces in the war. The decision comes after months of frustration, as bitterly divided members of Congress deadlocked over the funding, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson to cobble together a bipartisan coalition to pass the bill. The $95 billion foreign aid package, including billions for Israel and Taiwan, passed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approval was expected either Tuesday or Wednesday. The votes are the result of weeks of high-voltage debate, including threats from Johnson's hard-right faction to oust him as speaker. About $61 billion of the aid is for Ukraine. The package includes an array of ammunition, including air defense munitions and large amounts of artillery rounds that are much in demand by Ukrainian forces, as well as armored vehicles and other weapons. The U.S. officials said some of the weapons will be delivered very quickly to the battlefront -- at times within days -- but it could take longer for other items to arrive. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid had not yet been publicly announced.\n\nColumbia University canceled in-person classes, dozens of protesters were arrested at New York University and Yale, and the gates to Harvard Yard were closed to the public Monday as some of the most prestigious U.S. universities sought to defuse campus tensions over Israel's war with Hamas. More than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green were arrested last week, and similar encampments have sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggle with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses. At New York University, an encampment set up by students swelled to hundreds of protesters throughout the day Monday. The school said it warned the crowd to leave, then called in the police after the scene became disorderly and the university said it learned of reports of \"intimidating chants and several antisemitic incidents.\" Shortly after 8:30 p.m., officers began making arrests. The protests have pitted students against one another, with pro-Palestinian students demanding that their schools condemn Israel's assault on Gaza and divest from companies that sell weapons to Israel. Some Jewish students, meanwhile, say much of the criticism of Israel has veered into antisemitism and made them feel unsafe, and they point out that Hamas is still holding hostages taken during the group's Oct. 7 invasion. - AP\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Turkey has urged citizens to avoid flying Turkish Airlines due to a recent uptick in passengers being denied boarding on connecting flights from Istanbul to Latin American destinations. \"We're compelled to advise our citizens to carefully weigh the advisability of using the services of this airline,\" the embassy said in a statement Monday. It accused Turkish Airlines of turning away Russian passengers from boarding flights to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Panama and other Latin American countries without explanation in recent weeks. \"The issue exists and it's a serious one. And it's unclear to us to what extent the Turkish authorities realize its seriousness,\" the Russian embassy said, adding that the Turkish foreign ministry has provided \"no clear reaction\" to its written and verbal complaints. - Moscow Times\n\nIsrael has not provided evidence to support its accusation that a \"significant\" number of employees of the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip are members of terrorist organizations, according to an independent review commissioned by the United Nations.\n\nGoogle has fired an additional 20 workers that it says were involved in protests last week over the company's cloud-computing contract with the Israeli government, bringing the total number of workers fired to 50, according to the group organizing the demonstrations. No Tech for Apartheid, the organizers of the protest at Google offices last Tuesday, said in a statement Monday evening that Google had fired an additional 20 workers, on top of the 30 workers terminated last week.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_bociurkiw@kyivpost.com", "name": "Michael Bociurkiw", "type": "author",

Regardless of what anyone says, we are gaining the support we need to continue protecting lives from Russian attacks,\" he said.\n\n\"Now we will do everything possible to make up for the six months that have passed in debate, in doubts,\" he said.\n\nUkraine has been suffering from acute shortages of artillery shells for months with more-numerous, better-equipped Russian forces slowly advancing in the east.\n\nThe final arrival of the aid is a huge boost for morale, but it is unclear whether it will be enough to repel mounting Russian battlefield momentum in the east in the coming weeks.\n\nTop Kyiv officials have been warning for weeks that Russia may be planning a big offensive this summer or as early as late May.\n\nWith its dwindling stocks of air defence missiles, Russia has been pounding targets in Ukraine, pounding the energy system in particular, prompting rolling blackouts in some regions.\n\nZelenskiy said Kyiv had been working closely with U.S. officials to work out an incoming $1 billion military package containing \"exactly the weapons that our soldiers need\".\n\nHe specifically mentioned Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), artillery, anti-tank weapons and high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS) and much-needed air defence.\n\n\"I thank all the Americans in the defense industry, every state that produces weapons that now indeed protect democracy and our way of life,\" he said.\n\nBiden said earlier he had approved an initial $1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.\n\n(Reporting by Yuliia Dysa; Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The US, too, recognizes the Chinese sovereignty over the self-ruled island but provides it with military aid.\n\nThe aid comes against a backdrop of growing protests against Israel's genocidal war in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children since October last year.\n\nThe US has been the main supplier of weapons and aid to Israel in defiance of international outcry.\n\nIsraeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the billions of dollars in US assistance, writing on X that it \"demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Israel.\"\n\nHowever, the Palestinian presidency condemned the bill as \"an aggression against the Palestinian people\" and a \"dangerous escalation.\"\n\nThe money would \"translate into thousands of

After six long months, the House of Representatives passed a series of national security supplemental bills through the chamber. The Senate followed suit days later, and President Joe Biden signed the $95 billion foreign-aid package into law on April 24.\n\nBy now, you probably know what's in the legislation -- $61 billion is earmarked for Ukraine, with more than a third of that sum going toward replenishing U.S. defense stockpiles that have been emptied to assist Kyiv's defense against Russia. Israel will receive more than $26 billion. Washington's allies in the Indo-Pacific will get about $8 billion, with Taiwan receiving the lion's share.\n\nProponents of the legislation are giddy with excitement. Yet as anybody who has ever had a hangover can attest, the next day tends to bring you back to reality.\n\nFirst thing's first: There's no question this substantial sum of cash will help Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan protect their security, interests, and prerogatives. The massive aid will buy each of these U.S. partners a lot of valuable, highly-effective military equipment. In Taiwan's case, the money will likely go toward purchasing the kinds of military platforms -- anti-ship missiles, land-attack cruise missiles, mines, and various munitions -- that would reinforce deterrence against a prospective Chinese invasion of the island. Ukraine will use the money to bring as much artillery to the frontline as possible; according to public reports, the Biden administration will send long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems to Ukraine for the first time, broadening Kyiv's ability to strike Russian targets as far as 190 miles behind the lines. Israel will bolster its stockpile of air defense interceptors, which proved their worth during Iran's missile and drone barrage several weeks ago.\n\nThat's the good news. The bad news: Money can only do so much.\n\nMoney, for instance, is not going to fix the Ukrainian army's manpower shortages, which continue to be hobbled by a combination of battlefield attrition, ineffective recruitment tactics, and unfavorable demographics. The Russians may not be particularly inept at war-fighting and have failed to make big breakthroughs in the field, but they have one big advantage over Ukraine: more people. Russia's population is three times the size of Ukraine's, and Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't really have to concern himself with finding men willing to fight and die there. Despite losing about 900 men a day, the U.K. Defense Ministry assesses that Moscow is recruiting about 30,000 personnel a month.\n\nThe same thing can't be said for Ukraine. While Ukrainian lawmakers understood that the army was in desperate need of reinforcements, they spent a year fighting among themselves about how to raise the numbers. This month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lowered the draft age from 27 to 25. The Ukrainian parliament also passed new reforms to the registration process, increasing penalties for eligible men who seek to avoid the draft, requiring all men between the ages of 18-60 to provide up-to-date information about their whereabouts, and mandating basic military training for Ukrainians 18-25. But in a sign of just how tenuous Kyiv's situation is, those same lawmakers also stripped a provision that would demobilize troops who have been fighting since the war began. Ultimately, Ukraine is a prisoner of its own population trends; bullets, air defense systems, and long-range missiles don't solve it.\n\nMoney won't solve Israel's problems either. All the U.S. taxpayer funds in the world won't help alleviate Israel's questionable war strategy in Gaza, which is undermining its global reputation, causing turmoil in the U.S.-Israel relationship, and probably creating as many terrorists as it's killing. Sure, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have killed as many as 13,000 Hamas fighters over the last six-plus months but Gaza itself isn't under Israeli military control. In fact, areas in northern Gaza that were declared cleared by the IDF months ago are again hot-zones. This week, Israeli forces conducting operations in the northern Gaza cities of Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia, and Gaza City after Palestinian militants launched a small salvo of rockets toward Israel.\n\nNor does Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seem to know what he wants in Gaza once the war is declared over. The Israeli premier has been winging it the entire time, trapped between his maximalist and contradictory objectives (Hamas' total defeat and the freeing of hostages), and an unwillingness to propose any post-Gaza plan that is even half-serious. Instead, what we have are vague declarations about victory and unworkable schemes that call for permanent Israeli security control from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan Valley, which the United States, let alone Arab-majority states, wouldn't support. U.S. aid money won't do anything to address this.\n\nTaiwan is a slightly different story, if only because war hasn't broken out in the Taiwan Strait. The Biden administration is hoping that the security assistance package for Taipei will impact China's strategic calculus toward the self-governed island democracy. But this will depend in large part on what weapons Taiwan chooses to buy. If it's big-ticket items like fighter jets or tanks, which China's Air Force would destroy on the ground during the opening hours of hostilities, then Chinese President Xi Jinping's thought process is unlikely to change.\n\nAs the old saying goes, money doesn't buy happiness. It doesn't necessarily buy security either.\n\nDaniel R.

It's not clear why.\n\n\"Just 10 days ago we saw Iran launch over 100 missiles and drones at Israel,\" Biden reminded reporters. \"An unprecedented attack following years of Iran supporting Hezbollah, Hamas and proxies ... they fund these guys,\" he commented.\n\n\"My commitment to Israel, I want to make clear again, is ironclad. The security of Israel is critical. I'll always make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and the terrorists it supports.\n\n\"With this aid the United States can help replenish Israel's air defense, and provide other critical [ordnance] so Iran can never carry out the destruction it intended when it attacked 10 days ago.\"\n\nThe package includes $13 billion in aid for Israeli defensive activities, $3.6 billion in security assistance and $9.2 billion for Israeli humanitarian aid to Gaza. That comes in addition to a separate allocation of $1 billion for direct humanitarian aid to Gaza, which Biden warned Israel to ensure the assistance reaches its intended recipients.\n\n\"At the same time, this bill significantly increases the humanitarian assistance we're sending to the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering badly -- who are suffering the consequences of the war that Hamas started,\" Biden emphasized.\n\n\"This bill includes one billion dollars in additional humanitarian aid in Gaza,\" he said. \"We're going to immediately secure that aid and surge it, including food, medical supplies, clean water, and Israel MUST MAKE SURE that all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza, WITHOUT DELAY,\" he declared, waggling his finger with a \"bad boy\" shake for emphasis.\n\n\"And everything we do is guided by the ultimate goal of bringing these hostages home, securing a ceasefire, and setting the conditions for an enduring peace,\" Biden added.\n\nSince Israel has absolutely no control over the aid once it crosses the border into Gaza, which Biden obviously knows, his motivation for the \"nu nu-ing\" the Jewish State is unclear.\n\nLikewise, \"securing a ceasefire\" has more to do with ending the ability of Hamas to attack and retain hostages than it has to do with negotiations -- as seen by the repeated failures of talks aimed at securing an agreement, with each proposal rejected by the Iranian backed terror group.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press -

In recent days and weeks, the Kremlin has telegraphed that Kharkiv City and Chasiv Yar in the Donbas are next on Putin's list to be \"liberated,\" or in other words reduced to piles of rubble.\n\nMoscow continues to bomb both cities as it prepares to launch a new major spring or summer counteroffensive. On Monday, Moscow upped its messaging by destroying a civilian TV tower in Kharkiv. Earlier in April, eight Ukrainian civilians in the city were killed and 10 wounded by Russian attacks.\n\nOlga Skabeyeva, Putin's favorite TV propagandist, pitched these latest attacks in Kharkiv as part of Russia's efforts to create a \"sanitary zone\" in eastern Ukraine. In any other language, Putin's \"Iron Doll,\" as he likes to think of her, is admitting Moscow is preparing to intensify the Kremlin's genocidal war against Ukrainians.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov simultaneously was echoing the same ominous wording. As the Institute for the Study of War observed, it was not a coincidence. Lavrov bluntly asserted that Kharkiv \"plays an important role\" in Moscow's plans to impose a \"sanitary zone\" in Ukraine.\n\nBut Kharkiv City and Chasiv Yar are only intended as stepping stones. Putin will not stop his genocidal military campaign until all of Ukraine is turned into a so-called \"sanitary zone,\" and even then, he will continue looking westward and south toward Moldova and Georgia to complete the trifecta.\n\nPresident Biden and his national security team are facing a moment of truth in Ukraine. Simply funding the war in Ukraine without changing the dynamics will likely result in Putin winning over time.\n\nThe storm in Ukraine is gathering and the president must determine whether he has the will and conviction to face it and see Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his generals through to victory. Yes, Biden has extended a lifeline to Ukraine, but he has done so while creating conditions for a forever war that Kyiv cannot ultimately win.\n\nFunding a defensive war, as we have repeatedly warned, was never going to be enough to stop Putin in Ukraine or elsewhere in eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Ukrainian victory, on the other hand, can and will. But that outcome will require a radical shift in strategic thinking in the White House and among the president's national security team.\n\nBiden can get there by drawing a red line in Kharkiv. For now, the city still stands. But soon, its landscape if left unchecked, will be as desolate as Bakhmut and Avdiivka are now after Russia's indiscriminate artillery barrages.\n\nIt is time for Washington and Brussels to become bold. Funding is in hand and now Biden must turn that funding into a winning hand for Ukraine.\n\nA NATO-enforced no-fly zone, to protect Ukraine's major population centers from Russian missile and drone attacks, is one course of action that should be considered. The West cannot continue to look away as Putin commits wholesale genocide in Ukraine by intentionally targeting civilians, weaponizing food and causing widescale ecological disasters such as destroying in June last year the Nova Kakhovka Dam on the river Dnipro in the south of the country near Kherson.\n\nFrance could lead the way in this initiative if Biden will not. Emmanuel Macron, to his great credit, has recognized the importance to Europe's overall security of defeating Putin in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, by staving off Russia for now from threatening the Baltic States and Poland, deserves the same level of stalwart protection Israel received from the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Clear demarcation lines could be set. U.S. and NATO air assets would only be used to shoot down incoming Russian drones, cruise missiles and ICBMs targeting civilian Ukrainian population centers and infrastructure.\n\nBiden could also send a clear message to Putin by publicly announcing his intent to support a Ukrainian victory, and the removal of all Russian troops from the Donbas and Crimea. As retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of U.S. Army Europe has often stated, Crimea is the \"decisive terrain\" of this war.\n\nBy doing so, Biden would at last stop being so predictable. Presently, Putin knows that the White House -- and particularly Jake Sullivan, the president's national security advisor -- is gripped by escalation fears. Biden must change that equation.\n\nThreatening Crimea would do just that. It will also force Putin's military planners to reconsider whether or not Moscow's likely forthcoming counteroffensive against Kharkiv is worth further exposing the peninsula.\n\nPutin played that game against the West, using the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel a distraction under which to launch his assault on Avdiivka days later. Now, Biden can and must turn the tables on Putin in Crimea.\n\nBiden will not deter Putin by simply saying \"don't.\" His \"don't\" already did not stop Iran from directly attacking Israel. Nor has it stopped North Korea's brinksmanship with Japan and South Korea, nor China's harassment of Filipino shipping in the South China Sea and machinations against Taiwan.\n\nAnything would be more persuasive than Biden's \"don't.\" Most persuasive of all would be for Ukraine to destroy immediately the Kerch Bridge connecting the Crimean Peninsula to Russia's mainland. That would give Putin his own gathering storm to worry about. The introduction of ATACMS by the U.S., an additional 1,600 Storm Shadow missiles from the UK, and F-16 fighter jets already makes that course of action realistic.\n\nThe addition of these precision deep-strike weapons and munitions also allows Ukraine to win the interdiction war. And to strike back at Russian drone, cruise missile and ICBM launch sites - and key command and control and logistic centers such as the port city of Rostov-on-Don located on the Sea of Azov.\n\nBiden and his national security team, alongside NATO, now own the outcome of this war, win or lose. Congress gave Biden all of the funding he sought and more, and on a bipartisan basis. He is now out of excuses. It is his responsibility to face the gathering storm Kharkiv and Chasiv Yar and turn it into the beginning of the end of Putin's adventurism in Europe and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com",

The largest portion of the 95 billion is 61 billion to Ukraine, then there's a portion allocated to Israel specifically to hunt down Hamas. Then you got a portion for humanitarian aid for Gaza, how? We do not know as there is no figure put to that. Lastly, there is also aid to Taiwan to push back against China,\" detailed Williams.\n\nWe get compartmentalised, explained Williams, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the problem as he is pushing US President Joe Biden as they do not want him to go into Rafah. According to Williams, the US wants some humanitarian pause but they also understand the issue of Hamas.\n\nSimilarly, if they do not allocate a portion for Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is going to run over Ukraine, said Williams.\n\n\"The money for Ukraine is aimed to prolong the war, not so they can win the war since the countries in the European Union North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are unable to help Ukraine. The nato alliance will not put troops with boots on the ground, and while you give weapons, the average soldier in the Ukrainian army is 43 years old,\" remarked Williams.\n\n\"The entire matter is about the US being scared that its global hegemonic power is being threatened since it has brought China and Russia closer. When the war in Ukraine took place, the US sent warships to Taiwan; it also assisted Russia with arms. China and Russia have a defense pact, and Iran has a defense pact with China and Russia,\" stressed Williams.\n\nHe added that the US is now dragging in Russia and China because they need to create that crisis for their own hegemony.", "source": {"uri": "vocfm.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Voice of the Cape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aneeqa_du_plessis@vocfm.co.za", "name": "Aneeqa Du Plessis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.vocfm.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GL8GwSlXkAAEjZO.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504789", "eventUri": "eng-9504789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

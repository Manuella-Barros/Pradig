Time Magazine published a damning report offering an \"inside\" look behind President Biden's shocking debate performance, which began with a scene involving his wife meeting with \"financial bigwigs\" before he took the stage. \"As President Joe Biden was going over his final notes with his inner circle and getting ready to debate Donald Trump on June 27 in Atlanta, his wife slipped into a nearby meeting of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest donors,\" Time reported Friday. \"The Biden Victory Fund and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s financial bigwigs had all assembled in the Ritz Carlton as part of a two-day political briefing that featured emotional pep talks and face-time with VIPs. \u2018Joe\u2019s ready to go,\u2019 Dr. Biden told the group. \u2018He\u2019s prepared.\u2019\" \"Fact check: false,\" the magazine added. MEDIA FIGURES SHOCKED AT BIDEN'S 'BAD' DEBATE PERFORMANCE: \u2018TOTAL AND COMPLETE DISASTER\u2019 At the debate after-party, Biden was enthusiastically praised by his wife, who seemed to celebrate the mere fact that the president responded to moderators' questions. \"Joe, you did such a great job! You answered every question, you knew all the facts!\" the first lady gushed over a smiling Joe Biden on-stage. Time magazine offered a brutal post-debate assessment, posing the questions for Democrats, \"Was there any way to get him off the ticket? And if not, was there any chance to stagger across the finish line with a deeply flawed candidate?\" \"Either way, it was nothing like what Biden and his team had plotted while secluded at the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland\u2019s mountains for six full days of rehearsal in an airplane hangar and movie theater,\" Time said. \"For all the talk about the most successful first-term agenda ever and a history-defying midterm election, Biden's team spent the wee hours of Thursday and all of Friday trying to talk Democrats off a ledge.\" The story was accompanied by a cover depicting Biden wandering off the page with the caption \"Panic.\" BIDEN'S \u2018DISASTER\u2019 DEBATE PERFORMANCE SPARKS MEDIA MELTDOWN, CALLS FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM 2024 RACE There has been a liberal media meltdown since Thursday's explosive presidential debate, sparking calls for Biden to step aside. \"Mr. Biden has been an admirable president. Under his leadership, the nation has prospered and begun to address a range of long-term challenges, and the wounds ripped open by Mr. Trump have begun to heal. But the greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election,\" The New York Times editorial board wrote Friday. NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD CALLS FOR BIDEN TO DROP OUT: HIS CANDIDACY IS A \u2018RECKLESS GAMBLE\u2019 Several New York Times columnists shared similar views, including longtime Biden ally Thomas Friedman, who wrote the debate \"made me weep\" and realize Biden should step aside. \"I cannot remember a more heartbreaking moment in American presidential campaign politics in my lifetime \u2014 precisely because of what it revealed: Joe Biden, a good man and a good president, has no business running for re-election,\" Friedman wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CNN commentator Van Jones, who cried for joy when Biden won the 2020 presidential election, seemed on the verge of tears as he described how \"personally painful\" the debate performance was. \"I love that guy as a good man. He loves his country. He\u2019s doing the best that he can. But he had a test to meet tonight, to restore confidence of the country and of the base, and he failed to do that,\" Jones said. \"And I think there\u2019s a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a different course now.\" \"We\u2019re still far from our convention and there is time for this party to figure out a different way forward if he will allow us to do that. But that was not what we needed from Joe Biden,\" he added. \"And it\u2019s personally painful for a lot of people. It\u2019s not just panic. It\u2019s pain of what we saw tonight.\"", "summary": "Time Magazine published a brutal &quot;inside&quot; look of President Biden&apos;s disastrous presidential debate revealing the first lady assuring donors he was &quot;ready to go.&quot;", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/jill-biden-privately-assured-donors-joes-ready-go-ahead-disastrous-debate-report", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/06/931/523/JillJoeBidenCNNDebate.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:46:29", "author": "Joseph Wulfsohn", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.093}

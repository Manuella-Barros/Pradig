As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" it continues.\n\nThe gist of the op-ed is that Biden's recent debate performance against former President Donald Trump was so bad that he has to drop out and let someone more competent and with it take over, lest Trump win the 2024 election and be reelected president.\n\nEver since the op-ed's publication, Clooney has been receiving the hero treatment from fellow establishment leftists for telling the truth about President Vegetable. But according to Portnoy of Barstool Sports, this narrative is absurd.\n\nListen to him explain why below:\n\n\"George Clooney, what a f-king hero this guy is, huh?\" he began. \"Comes forward today -- now, this guy threw a fundraiser, raised tens of millions, co-chair for Biden, three weeks ago. Today comes out, he's like, 'Guess what? The guy you saw in the debate, that vegetable, that's f-king Biden, he's a vegetable.'\"\n\n\"He was a vegetable three weeks ago. Acting like he's doing some heroic thing,\" Portnoy added.\n\nExactly. Every honest person with common sense had already admitted Biden was a vegetable/walking corpse ages ago. Meaning the fact that Clooney is just NOW fessing up to it right when it's convenient for the Democrat Party's goals shows just how garbage of a person he really is.\n\n\"So what, George, if [Biden] didn't do the debate and wasn't a vegetable, you were just going to keep your mouth shut?\" Portnoy continued, asking with disgust. \"And by the way, if you just found out Biden was a vegetable, where have you been for two years? Everyone knows he's a vegetable.\"\n\nPortnoy went on to cite example after example of the president's vegetable ways, including the fact that the president can't \"get on and off a stage without getting lost.\"\n\n\"He talks about dead people like he had lunch with them yesterday,\" Portnoy said. \"He can't f-king ride his bike without falling down. He can't get up and down f-king Air Force One without taking a tumble. No s-t he's a vegetable. He's been a vegetable for two f-king years. Democrats don't care.\"\n\nOr rather, Democrats and their equally conniving allies -- i.e., Clooney -- didn't care up until the moment Biden became a liability to their corrupt, twisted agenda.\n\nPortnoy wasn't done.\n\n\"If I know he's a vegetable, if Miss Peaches knows he's a vegetable [referring to his dog] if Clooney knows he's a vegetable, if the Obamas know he's a vegetable, if everyone in the world knows Joe Biden is a f-king vegetable, why did he do that debate?\" he asked rhetorically.\n\n\"Because Democrats wanted to show the world that they have no choice but to f-king whack him,\" he added, arguing that Democrats were always intent on throwing Biden under the bus for someone better like California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nContinuing his screed, Portnoy noted again that the Democrats \"were [for years] fine\" with \"putting a vegetable in our face.\"\n\n\"They're fine with doing a fundraiser three weeks ago for a vegetable. So f-k it, let's just have Trump run versus a head of lettuce. Honestly? The votes will probably be the same,\" he said.\n\n\"So f-k all these games and stuff. Everyone knows Biden's a vegetable. So let's just do the ballot.

Portnoy continued.

He's been a vegetable for two f***ing years, the Democrats don't f***ing care.'\n\nIn the clip, Portnoy then goes on to speculate about 'dirty politics' and his belief that the Democrats are trying to 'whack' Biden.\n\n'You have the good-looking guy from California, Gavin Newsom, waiting,' he continues, before adding: 'F*** it, let's just have Trump run vs a head of lettuce.

If he didn't do the debate ... and wasn't a vegetable, you were just gonna keep your mouth shut?\" Portnoy asked in a three-minute-fifteen-second video he posted to Twitter on Wednesday.\n\n\"And by the way, if you just found out Biden was a vegetable three weeks ago, where have you been for two years? Everyone knows he's a fucking vegetable\" he said, echoing the sentiments of many Americans following the Democrats' panicked post-debate response.\n\nPortnoy went on to list a number of high-profile Biden gaffes in recent years as examples to prove Biden's vegetable-ness.\n\n\"The guy can't get on and off a stage without getting lost.

Clooney argued that the president is not \"even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nBrutal words, George.\n\nWasn't it just last month that you held a glitzy Tinseltown fundraiser that brought in $28 million for the befuddled president? Question: Why did you wait three weeks to tell Americans this very important news?\n\nInquiring minds want to know, and Dave Portnoy has an inquiring mind. (Warning: major profanity):\n\nGeorge Clooney, what a f------ hero this guy is, huh? Comes forward today -- now, this guy threw a fundraiser, raised tens of millions, co-chair for Biden, three weeks ago. Today comes out, he's like, 'Guess what? The guy you saw in the debate, that vegetable, that's f------ Biden, he's a vegetable. He was a vegetable three weeks ago.' Acting like he's doing some heroic thing.\n\nNow, appreciation for internet rants can be in the eye of the beholder, and certainly, Portnoy is a loud, profane personality and has his detractors. He's dead on here, though -- Clooney got to play the Tinseltown hero by raking in huge amounts of cash for Biden, but now he's belatedly stabbing him in the back weeks later. Not my kind of hero.\n\nIt doesn't take the better part of a month to write an Op-Ed, George.\n\nOne of the things I've focused on recently is the apparent astonishment across the Democratic universe regarding Biden's decline. \"I'm shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\" they seem to be saying, but like the infamous Captain Louis Renault, played by Claude Rains in the 1942 classic \"Casablanca,\" they've known all along exactly what's been going on.\n\nThe New York Times, NBC's Chuck Todd, Democrat lawmakers across the spectrum... They're all saying, gosh, we didn't see this coming. Even though the president's decline has been in front of their -- and our eyes -- for years now. The dishonesty is off the charts.\n\nI'm guessing Clooney -- an extremely plugged-in Demcrat insider with a controversial progressive wife -- like so many others, has known for a long time about Biden's deterioration. But now he wants to be brave and make headlines by calling the president out. Are you just angling for a \"Vanity Fair\" cover? Where have you been for the last three and a half years, George?\n\nPortnoy was far from done:\n\n\"So what, George? If [Biden] didn't do the debate... and wasn't a vegetable, you were just going to keep your mouth shut?\" Portnoy continued. \"And by the way, if you just found out Biden was a vegetable, where have you been for two years? Everyone knows he's a vegetable.\"\n\nPortnoy claimed Biden can't \"get on and off a stage without getting lost, he talks about dead people like he had lunch with them yesterday. He can't f------ ride his bike without falling down. He can't get up and down f------ Air Force One without taking a tumble. No s--- he's a vegetable. He's been a vegetable for two f------ years. Democrats don't care.\"\n\nPortnoy went on, and there's plenty more in the above video. But he calls it right in his summation: \"It's all dirty politics.\"\n\nClooney knew, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer knew, Vice President Kamala Harris knew, the list goes on ad nauseam... and yet they all lied to us. The chickens are coming home to roost, and good for Portnoy for calling it out, whatever you think of his style.\n\nHow stunning and brave are our Hollywood heroes!\n\nWhile they were gaslighting you the last three and a half years, we at RedState were keeping it real every step of the way, calling out their lies. But it's not easy -- they try to stop us with their Big Tech censorship regime. Will they \"demonetize\" this article or \"shadow ban\" it, or will they hit the next one?\n\nIf you're getting your information from the legacy corporate media, you're not actually getting the

Download the app on Apple and Google Play.\n\nThe president of Barstool Sports is none too impressed with the president of celebrities. George Clooney dropped a New York Times opinion piece calling for Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing a fundraiser from three weeks ago where he could tell Biden wasn't all there. Note: This fundraiser was a week BEFORE the debate. Dave Portnoy lit up Clooney's sudden virtue signaling over \"noticing\" Joe Biden was a vegetable.\n\nWe the People have been noticing Biden is a vegetable for the past four years. And you know El Pres was pissed. He took time away from lounging in the pool and crushing Nooners to hold an emergency press conference.\n\nGeorge Clooney, what a f-*cking hero this guy is, huh? Raised tens of millions [for Biden] three weeks ago. Today comes out, he's like, 'Guess what? The guy you saw in the debate, that vegetable, that's f*cking Biden, he's a vegetable. He was a vegetable three weeks ago.' Acting like he's doing some heroic thing.\n\nPortnoy suggested a suitable replacement for Biden on the Democrat ticket since Dems care less about their candidate being a vegetable than they do about hating Donald Trump.\n\nThere's is just one point about Clooney \"suddenly\" realizing Biden's a vegetable and that everyone at the event saw Biden's a vegetable that Portnoy missed. I don't think I have to tell him how much the media sucks at life and is the enemy of the people. The Clooney fundraiser was the one where Obama had to lead Biden off stage like a lost child.\n\nThe one where Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself), citing \"independent\" \"fact\" checkers, claimed was right-wing media spreading another cheap fake video.\n\nIt's not just that Clooney's sudden and sanctimonious concern over having a vegetable for president, in an opinion piece he was mostly likely told to write by Barack Obama, was pathetic and Exhibit Q of everything Americans hate about elitist Hollywood celebrities. It's that his fundraiser was a VERY SPECIFIC EVENT where everyone saw Biden looking like a vegetable where we were told by the Left and media (but I repeat myself) not to believe our lying eyes.\n\nAs Jake Tapper says post-debate now that journalismers have permission to admit Biden looks like he doesn't know where he is, how all these people, got in his room, or who pooped his pants, \"The spinning is all very reminiscent of the George Orwell quote from the book 1984. It's relevant again today. 'The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.'\"\n\nGeorge Clooney was fine with the President of the United States being a vegetable three weeks ago and would have been fine with it had it not been for the debate performance. You don't get a cookie for calling it out now.\n\n><\n\nBrodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Biden's team has since admitted it was a bad night and pointed to a cold and jet lag from a return trip from Europe 12 days prior as reasons he was off that night.\n\n\"I'm probably in the minority... I thought Biden did great because I was expecting him not to be able to put a sentence together,\" Portnoy said. \"If you have actually paid even a tiny bit of attention to Joe Biden over the last year or two years, you know that he's gone and it happens when you get old.\"\n\nPortnoy accused Clooney and others like Chuck Todd of delaying their reactions to Biden until after the debate. Clooney penned an op-ed this week calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee just weeks after helping to host a fundraiser for the president. Todd also reported on his podcast this week that a \"senior\" member of Biden's cabinet raised concerns about him running for reelection two years ago.\n\n\"I couldn't believe they let him do the debate, which brings to the point if all these people -- Clooney, Chuck Todd, whoever, everybody knew that this man is basically a vegetable,\" Portnoy said. \"Why would you ever let him do that debate unless you wanted to show the world that he's gone and get rid of him? It's shameful and the crazy part is I think a lot of people... you could say it's Trump versus a head of lettuce and people hate Trump so much they may vote for the head of lettuce.\"\n\n\"Dave, so are you suggesting Biden's own team set him up to blow it?\" Steve Doocy asked.\n\n\"Yeah, I think the Democrats,\" Portnoy said.\n\nHe argued anyone close to Biden would have known what to expect prior to sending him on that debate stage.\n\n\"What did they expect to happen? I literally was like, oh, he's doing better than I thought and the rest of the country's like, this is the worst thing ever,\" he said. \"It's like, where have you been?!\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Todd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Todd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Doocy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Doocy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/portnoy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724248", "eventUri": "eng-9724248", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Portnoy questioned Clooney's timing, asking why he waited three weeks to express concerns if Biden's condition was truly alarming.\n\nPortnoy's comments came in response to an interview in which Clooney implied that President Biden might be struggling with cognitive issues. Portnoy didn't mince words, pointing out the inconsistency in Clooney's actions. \"If Biden was so far gone, why'd you wait three weeks to tell us?\" Portnoy asked, emphasizing the potential impact of such a delay on public perception and political discourse.\n\nPortnoy's critique highlights a broader debate over the transparency and timeliness of information shared by influential public figures. He argued that delays in addressing significant concerns, especially about a sitting president's mental fitness, can lead to misinformation and confusion.\n\nClooney has not yet responded to Portnoy's remarks, but the exchange underscores the increasingly polarized nature of political commentary in the media. As public figures continue to weigh in on political issues, the timing and manner of their statements remain under scrutiny.\n\nPortnoy, known for his outspoken and often controversial opinions, has once again sparked a conversation about accountability and responsibility in public discourse.

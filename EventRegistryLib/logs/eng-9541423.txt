(Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nThis year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone, but Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan.\n\nAbel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp.\n\nAbel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting \"our cost structure right\" after delivering disappointing results.\n\nSuccession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other top executive who oversees the company's insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire's board spends plenty of time focused on \"what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,\" as Jain put it. Finding the right replacement for any of the three of them will be important.\n\nPreviously, Buffett had said that when Abel becomes CEO, investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who's also taken on the responsibility of being Geico's CEO, would handle Berkshire's massive portfolio. But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that \"I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.\"\n\nAnd Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks.\n\nBut Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn't always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that.\n\n\"I think stock picking is hard. I don't think it's something you can just start doing and be good at it,\" Shanahan said.\n\nAbel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire's utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he's never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn't say that Saturday.\n\nAbel just reassured shareholders that \"the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.\"\n\n\"Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it's got to give you less -- not because it's a worse circumstance -- but because it hasn't been very transparent and communicated that clearly. You've got to start asking, well, what else is going to change?\" said Cole Smead with Smead Capital Management.\n\nAbel definitely has the confidence of the CEOs at all of Berkshire's many varied noninsurance businesses who report to him and ask his advice on any challenges they are facing.\n\n\"Greg sees so much more than I do on a daily basis. So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,\" said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions.\n\nSee's Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire's core values, with the company's emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire's subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently.\n\n\"He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,\" said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. \"So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.\"\n\nThe shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren't listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident. Some of them even got the chance to take selfies with Abel, though Buffett no longer tours the exhibit hall in public.\n\n\"I think they'll be fine,\" said Michael Grizzard, who made the trip to Omaha from Richmond, Virginia, for the second time. \"They're in good hands, and I think they have a good culture.\"\n\nSmead said even Buffett, who is easily one of the greatest investors the world has ever seen, has been having a hard time lately finding good investments big enough to make a difference at Berkshire except for the $135 billion Apple stake that remains its largest investment even after some trimming this year.\n\nSo no matter how good an investor Abel is, he will have a hard time finding deals big enough to provide a meaningful boost to Berkshire's earnings that approached $13 billion in a down first quarter. That challenge is a big part of why Buffett has warned investors not to expect any of the \"eye-popping performance\" of Berkshire's past.\n\nBut for now, Buffett showed that Abel may not need to take over anytime soon because he looked good and he has long said he has no plans to retire, even if he acknowledged Saturday that he doesn't have the same energy he used to. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert came away impressed with his stamina.\n\n\"There wasn't anything in that performance that I found worrisome or troubling,\" Seifert said.", "source": {"uri":

CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert came away impressed with his stamina.\n\n\"There wasn't anything in that performance that I found worrisome or troubling,\" Seifert said.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PacifiCorp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PacifiCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNSF_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BNSF Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Weschler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Weschler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaLink", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AltaLink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NV_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NV Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaw Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See's_Candies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "See's Candies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Sheridan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Sheridan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/829f632/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+312/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fdb%2F28%2F615fa98ae8faf118f5bbaf6c440a%2Fa0a309129559484fa388fd8a8c56d7f4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541423", "eventUri": "eng-9541423", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 243, "relevance": 1}

For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp.\n\nAbel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting \"our cost structure right\" after delivering disappointing results.\n\nSuccession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other top executive who oversees the company's insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire's board spends plenty of time focused on \"what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,\" as Jain put it. Finding the right replacement for any of the three of them will be important.\n\nPreviously, Buffett had said that when Abel becomes CEO, investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who's also taken on the responsibility of being Geico's CEO, would handle Berkshire's massive portfolio. But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that \"I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.\"\n\nAnd Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks.\n\nBut Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn't always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that.\n\n\"I think stock picking is hard. I don't think it's something you can just start doing and be good at it,\" Shanahan said.\n\nAbel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire's utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he's never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn't say that Saturday.\n\nAbel just reassured shareholders that \"the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.\"\n\n\"Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it's got to give you less -- not because it's a worse circumstance -- but because it hasn't been very transparent and communicated that clearly. You've got to start asking, well, what else is going to change?\" said Cole Smead with Smead Capital Management.\n\nAbel definitely has the confidence of the CEOs at all of Berkshire's many varied noninsurance businesses who report to him and ask his advice on any challenges they are facing.\n\n\"Greg sees so much more than I do on a daily basis. So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,\" said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions.\n\nSee's Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire's core values, with the company's emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire's subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently.\n\n\"He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,\" said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. \"So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.\"\n\nThe shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren't listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident.

For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp.\n\nAbel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting \"our cost structure right\" after delivering disappointing results.\n\nSuccession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other top executive who oversees the company's insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire's board spends plenty of time focused on \"what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,\" as Jain put it.

But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that \"I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.\"\n\nAnd Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Greg Abel poses for pictures with shareholders while touring the booths Berkshires companies set up, Friday, May 3, 2024, in Omaha, Neb. Abel will succeed Warren Buffett as CEO one day.

I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s something you can just start doing and be good at it,\" Shanahan said.\n\nAbel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire's utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he's never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn't say that Saturday.\n\nAbel just reassured shareholders that \"the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.\"\n\n\"Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it\u00b4s got to give you less - not because it\u00b4s a worse circumstance - but because it hasn\u00b4t been very transparent and communicated that clearly.

So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,\" said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions.\n\nSee's Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire's core values, with the company's emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire's subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently.\n\n\"He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,\" said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. \"So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.\"\n\nThe shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren't listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident.

For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Iowa homeowners age 65 and up are eligible for state tax exemption\n\nAbel pointed out that it required a major culture shift to get workers at PacifiCorp and the other utilities, who have long focused all their energy on keeping the lights on, to think about shutting the power down at times when the risk that their power lines could spark wildfires is too great. He also said BNSF railroad is working on getting \"our cost structure right\" after delivering disappointing results.\n\nSuccession was clearly top of mind for many of the thousands of people who filled an Omaha arena to listen to the two men after last fall's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Buffett, Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other top executive who oversees the company's insurers, reassured investors that Berkshire's board spends plenty of time focused on \"what would happen to the operation if I get hit by a truck,\" as Jain put it. Finding the right replacement for any of the three of them will be important.\n\nPreviously, Buffett had said that when Abel becomes CEO, investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who's also taken on the responsibility of being Geico's CEO, would handle Berkshire's massive portfolio. But Buffett said Saturday that his thinking has evolved, and that \"I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg.\"\n\nAnd Buffett said because Abel understands businesses so well, he also understands stocks.\n\nBut Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said a good business doesn't always make a good stock unless you get the timing and position size right, and there is an art to that.\n\n\"I think stock picking is hard. I don't think it's something you can just start doing and be good at it,\" Shanahan said.\n\nAbel does have a history of making multibillion-dollar deals when he was the head of Berkshire's utility unit for a decade, including the acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink, but he's never been a stock picker. Weschler and Combs might be able to help Abel get the timing right and find opportunities in the stock market, but Buffett didn't say that Saturday.\n\nAbel just reassured shareholders that \"the capital allocation principles that we use today will be maintained.\"\n\n\"Does that give you more or less confidence post-Buffett? I would say it's got to give you less -- not because it's a worse circumstance -- but because it hasn't been very transparent and communicated that clearly. You've got to start asking, well, what else is going to change?\" said Cole Smead with Smead Capital Management.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAbel definitely has the confidence of the CEOs at all of Berkshire's many varied noninsurance businesses who report to him and ask his advice on any challenges they are facing.\n\n\"Greg sees so much more than I do on a daily basis. So his perspective is valued, and his wisdom is something that is such a luxury for all of us to be able to tap into,\" said Dan Sheridan, who just became CEO of Brooks Running this year after his predecessor retired. He said Abel is always humble and curious about the business, even while asking challenging questions.\n\nSee's Candies CEO Pat Egan added that Abel reflects all of Berkshire's core values, with the company's emphasis on integrity, taking care of customers and strengthening brands, while still giving Berkshire's subsidiaries the freedom to operate independently.\n\n\"He really expects us to know our business, understand the parameters, and to run our business on a day to day basis,\" said Tim Baucom, CEO of flooring giant Shaw Industries. \"So I feel like I have all the freedom of the world, but with freedom comes responsibility.\"\n\nThe shareholders who attended the meeting and spent hours shopping and talking with executives at the booths Berkshire subsidiaries set up when they weren't listening to Buffett and Abel remain confident. Some of them even got the chance to take selfies with Abel, though Buffett no longer tours the exhibit hall in public.\n\n\"I think they'll be fine,\" said Michael Grizzard, who made the trip to Omaha from Richmond, Virginia, for the second time. \"They're in good hands, and I think they have a good culture.\"\n\nSmead said even Buffett, who is easily one of the greatest investors the world has ever seen, has been having a hard time lately finding good investments big enough to make a difference at Berkshire except for the $135 billion Apple stake that remains its largest investment even after some trimming this year.\n\nSo no matter how good an investor Abel is, he will have a hard time finding deals big enough to provide a meaningful boost to Berkshire's earnings that approached $13 billion in a down first quarter. That challenge is a big part of why Buffett has warned investors not to expect any of the \"eye-popping performance\" of Berkshire's past.\n\nBut for now, Buffett showed that Abel may not need to take over anytime soon because he looked good and he has long said he has no plans to retire, even if he acknowledged Saturday that he doesn't have the same energy he used to. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert came away impressed with his stamina.\n\n\"There wasn't anything in that performance that I found worrisome or troubling,\" Seifert said.\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

That challenge is a big part of why Buffett has warned investors not to expect any of the \"eye-popping performance\" of Berkshire's past.\n\nBut for now, Buffett showed that Abel may not need to take over anytime soon because he looked good and he has long said he has no plans to retire, even if he acknowledged Saturday that he doesn't have the same energy he used to. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert came away impressed with his stamina.\n\n\"There wasn't anything in that performance that I found worrisome or troubling,\" Seifert said.\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha on Saturday, investors questioned Buffett and Abel about succession.\n\n\"We have a very special company in Berkshire, but it's that culture that makes it special, and that's not going to change,\" Abel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, said at the shareholder meeting.\n\nBuffett repeatedly assured shareholders that Berkshire is in good hands, saying that Abel is \"in charge of really everything except insurance\" these days.\n\n\"We (have) got the same feeling in terms of judging the attractiveness of businesses and making capital decision and that sort of thing,\" Buffett said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director.\n\n\"Greg understands the (Berkshire) culture and he will honour that,\" said Olson ahead of the meeting. \"Greg doesn't think of himself as Warren Buffett, but I have no doubt seeing Greg running (Berkshire) the same way.\"\n\nAbel and Berkshire did not respond to requests for interviews.\n\nGregory Edward Abel was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on June 1, 1962, to a working-class family. Working odd jobs, he cleaned discarded bottles and filled fire extinguishers, according to the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, an education non-profit that honoured Abel in 2018.\n\n\"It was a real working-class family where sometimes people had jobs and sometimes they didn't,\" Abel said of his childhood in a video posted on the Horatio Alger website. \"You realized we were all working hard to try to advance our family.\"\n\nAbel graduated in 1984 from the University of Alberta and worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and energy firm CalEnergy. He joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then known as MidAmerican Energy, in 1992, which Berkshire took over in 1999 and became MidAmerican's chief in 2008. He now oversees Berkshire's noninsurance operations such as BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and dozens of chemical, industrial and retail operations.\n\nSome executives who work with Abel say he scrutinizes financial metrics such as inventory levels, cash flows, capital expenditure and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\n\"Greg looks at our inventory levels more than Warren did. He will sometimes circle it and be like 'Oh, that looks high,'\" Adrienne Perry, chief revenue officer at Borsheims, a Berkshire-owned jeweller, said last week at a talk in Omaha.\n\nDan Sheridan, chief executive of Brooks Running, a maker of running shoes that is owned by Berkshire, said Abel advises his executives broadly, but keeps an eye on the bottom line.\n\n\"If there are warts on your balance sheet, he's going to find them,\" Sheridan said in an interview.\n\nEven Buffett conceded on Saturday that Abel is a tougher boss.\n\n\"We haven't had a history of being very tough on people that coasted and we've had some that would do that,\" Buffett said. \"Greg will do something about it and Charlie and I wouldn't have.\"\n\nAccording to Berkshire's succession plan, Abel will replace Buffett in making all major investment and capital allocation decisions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who joined Berkshire in 1986, according to Berkshire's website, will oversee insurance operations.\n\nBuffett said on Saturday he would want Abel to have final say on decisions regarding Berkshire's portfolio of public stocks.\n\n\"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg,\" Buffett said on Saturday. \"He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses you understand common stocks.\"\n\nThe transition \"has already begun because Warren, five years ago, shifted these responsibilities onto Greg and Ajit directly,\" said Adam Mead, the CEO of Mead Capital and author of \"The Complete History of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett indicated on Saturday that his subordinates are already taking on much more of the day-to-day responsibility.\n\n\"The number of calls I get from managers is essentially awfully close to zero and Greg is handling those,\" Buffett said. \"I don't know quite how he does it, but we've got the right person, I can tell you that.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha on Saturday, investors questioned Buffett and Abel about succession.\n\n\"We have a very special company in Berkshire, but it's that culture that makes it special, and that's not going to change,\" Abel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, said at the shareholder meeting.\n\nBuffett repeatedly assured shareholders that Berkshire is in good hands, saying that Abel is \"in charge of really everything except insurance\" these days.\n\n\"We (have) got the same feeling in terms of judging the attractiveness of businesses and making capital decision and that sort of thing,\" Buffett said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director.\n\n\"Greg understands the (Berkshire) culture and he will honour that,\" said Olson ahead of the meeting. \"Greg doesn't think of himself as Warren Buffett, but I have no doubt seeing Greg running (Berkshire) the same way.\"\n\nAbel and Berkshire did not respond to requests for interviews.\n\nA DETAILS MAN\n\nGregory Edward Abel was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on June 1, 1962, to a working-class family. Working odd jobs, he cleaned discarded bottles and filled fire extinguishers, according to the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, an education non-profit that honoured Abel in 2018.\n\n\"It was a real working-class family where sometimes people had jobs and sometimes they didn't,\" Abel said of his childhood in a video posted on the Horatio Alger website. \"You realised we were all working hard to try to advance our family.\"\n\nAbel graduated in 1984 from the University of Alberta and worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and energy firm CalEnergy. He joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then known as MidAmerican Energy, in 1992, which Berkshire took over in 1999 and became MidAmerican's chief in 2008. He now oversees Berkshire's non-insurance operations such as BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and dozens of chemical, industrial and retail operations.\n\nSome executives who work with Abel say he scrutinises financial metrics such as inventory levels, cash flows, capital expenditure and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\n\"Greg looks at our inventory levels more than Warren did. He will sometimes circle it and be like 'Oh, that looks high,'\" Adrienne Perry, chief revenue officer at Borsheims, a Berkshire-owned jeweller, said last week at a talk in Omaha.\n\nDan Sheridan, chief executive of Brooks Running, a maker of running shoes that is owned by Berkshire, said Abel advises his executives broadly, but keeps an eye on the bottom line.\n\n\"If there are warts on your balance sheet, he's going to find them,\" Sheridan said in an interview.\n\nEven Buffett conceded on Saturday that Abel is a tougher boss.\n\n\"We haven't had a history of being very tough on people that coasted and we've had some that would do that,\" Buffett said. \"Greg will do something about it and Charlie and I wouldn't have.\"\n\nTRANSITION IN PROCESS\n\nAccording to Berkshire's succession plan, Abel will replace Buffett in making all major investment and capital allocation decisions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who joined Berkshire in 1986, according to Berkshire's website, will oversee insurance operations.\n\nBuffett said on Saturday he would want Abel to have final say on decisions regarding Berkshire's portfolio of public stocks.\n\n\"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg,\" Buffett said on Saturday. \"He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses you understand common stocks.\"\n\nThe transition \"has already begun because Warren, five years ago, shifted these responsibilities onto Greg and Ajit directly,\" said Adam Mead, the CEO of Mead Capital and author of \"The Complete History of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett indicated on Saturday that his subordinates are already taking on much more of the day-to-day responsibility.\n\n\"The number of calls I get from managers is essentially awfully close to zero and Greg is handling those,\" Buffett said. \"I don't know quite how he does it, but we've got the right person, I can tell you that.\"\n\n(Reporting by Koh Gui Qing in Omaha; additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by Megan Davies and Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

And of course, there's a lot of countries we don't understand at all. So Canada, it's terrific when you've got a major economy - not the size of the U.S., but a major economy that you absolutely, you feel confident about operating there.\"\n\nMr. Abel also serves as chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which includes existing Canadian assets.\n\nAssets north of the border include Calgary-based Berkshire Hathaway Energy Canada, which operates 13,000 kilometres of transmission lines and 300 substations in Alberta through AltaLink.\n\n\"It goes across many of our operating entities and then, as Warren touched on, all the businesses that we have a piece of that we're invested in are up in Canada. So the presence is significant,\" Mr. Abel said during the meeting. \"We're always looking at making incremental investments there because it's an environment we're very comfortable with.\"\n\nMr. Abel recently received the Canadian Business Leader Award in Edmonton from the University of Alberta, where he graduated with a bachelor of commerce in 1984. At the university, he had plans to major in finance but later switched to accounting.\n\nWhile it has been four decades since he graduated from the Edmonton university, he still visits friends and family regularly in Alberta, and he continues to monitor the Canadian economy.\n\n\"I would say the economy moves very closely to the U.S. So the results we're seeing out of our various businesses that report both the U.S. and Canadian operations aren't drastically different,\" Mr. Abel said. \"On the energy side, for example, we make very substantial investments up there in Alberta. But again, it's very consistent with how that economy is growing.\"\n\nHe is the nephew of the late Sid Abel, a hockey Hall of Famer who played for the Detroit Red Wings.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sid Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaLink", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AltaLink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Red Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alberta", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/CUAWEMR7JRDONFXP6IAWZHT2VY.jpg?auth=0114b697bd3ceeae84828f84defbb8f4bff93d861a7032a10937daec883ea785&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541423", "eventUri": "eng-9541423", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

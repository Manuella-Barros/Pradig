{"id": 225008124, "title": "The best Father's Day tech gift ideas", "text": "Look, if your dad is anything like me, then they\u2019re probably not a massive gamer, or might just play the odd title. I\u2019m told that there\u2019s a whole genre of Dad Games out there that apparently appeal to the fathers in our lives, which are all about following some sort of process. It\u2019s likely then that they won\u2019t have paid much attention to The Legend of Zelda series, which feels as un-Dad a game as you could imagine. Which is why I\u2019m here to say that, until the start of this year, I felt the same, but I\u2019ve since had my eyes opened to how amazing it really is. Even better, is that there\u2019s a brand new title in the Zelda series, Tears of the Kingdom, which I\u2019d urge all of you to check out. You play as Link, a little dude who \u2013 much like Mario \u2013 has to rescue a princess countless times throughout history. That normally involves traversing a beautiful, unspoiled paradise called Hyrule that\u2019s scattered with all sorts of monsters who want to kill you. From the outside, you might think that it\u2019s all just button-mashing and hyperactive combat, which is not a dad-friendly genre. But, in fact, the game puts far more emphasis on puzzle-solving and lateral thinking, and it has the best 3D puzzles this side of the Portal series which alone makes it ideal for dads the world over. Not to mention the freedom to tackle the game any which way you want to, giving you the choice to build your own solution rather than being forced to comply with Nintendo\u2019s. In the last game, Breath of the Wild, you could harness the game\u2019s physics and chemistry engines to dispatch troublesome enemies by using the environment against them. For instance, you could freeze them and then give them a whack, building up the kinetic energy to such an extent that they\u2019re sent hurtling miles away from you. Or, if you approach them in the middle of a storm, you can get them to raise their metallic swords in anger and get a dose of lightning. In this one, you can find scattered electronic components and assemble them however you want to jury-rig vehicles to help you get around. I mean, what could be more Dad-Game than that?", "summary": "<p>The big day is approaching and there\u2019s plenty of pressure for you to hand over a gift that says a lot all at once. It may be called Father\u2019s Day, but this is an event for you to say a loving thank you to whatever person held that special role in your life, irrespective of gender. Here\u2019s a list of the best gifts you can give to show your appreciation for all of the parenting they did, and may even still do.</p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"333a950eb31143bea12fe497870ae338\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"79005487e94b4c89be584b7e2472d137\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"b1f1096e5aa8458eaebfcf07dc3763c9\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"4736fbcefb844564b27bf5fedfc3de04\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"243a4b6ddf8949d396dc15e114a94885\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"ba219af383eb4548a0a710052365fa4d\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"b3e9e658bc0044b78e44f1bd8b5499a1\" data-type=\"product-list\"></p>\n<p><c", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas-123012557.html?src=rss", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1g95JTtrTAVjI8QNChm8tg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/1ac71630-16a3-11ef-b1ff-0d6e9b2071bb", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:36", "author": "Daniel Cooper", "authors": ["Daniel Cooper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.051}

Nor may the prosecution use 'prior convictions or proof of the prior commission of specific, criminal, vicious or immoral acts' other than to impeach the accused's credibility. It is our solemn duty to diligently guard these rights regardless of the crime charged, the reputation of the accused, or the pressure to convict.\"\n\nThe Judge continued, \"Defendant was convicted by a jury for various sexual crimes against three named complainants and, on appeal, claims that he was judged, not on the conduct for which he was indicted, but on irrelevant, prejudicial, and untested allegations of prior bad acts. We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose. The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light.

The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light. The synergistic effect of these errors was not harmless. The only evidence against defendant was the complainants' testimony, and the result of the court's rulings, on the one hand, was to bolster their credibility and diminish defendant's character before the jury. On the other hand, the threat of a cross-examination highlighting these untested allegations undermined defendant's right to testify. The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial.\n\nWeinstein received 23 years for \"forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and third-degree rape of hairstylist Jessica Mann in 2013.\"\n\nWeinstein became the face of the #MeToo movement when a bunch of Hollywood ladies took him out with a huge expose in The New York Times.\n\nThe trial court jury acquitted Weinstein \"of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault from actor Annabella Sciorra's allegations of rape in the '90s.\"\n\nThe court heavily cited People v. Molineux, a case decided in 1901. The prosecution used evidence implying Roland Molineux committed an earlier crime. Molineux's attorneys appealed and the State of New York Court of Appeals overturned the conviction:\n\nHow different is our own common law, which is the product of all the wisdom and humanity of all the ages. Under it the accused comes into a court of justice, panoplied in the presumption of innocence, which shields him until his guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. His general character can be thrown into the balance by no one but himself. The incidents of his life, not connected with the crime charged, are his sacred possession. He faces his accuser in the light of a distinct charge, with the assurance that no other will be, or can be, proved against him.\n\nThe case resulted in the Molineux rule known as 4.21. Evidence of Crimes and Wrongs (Molineux):\n\n(1) Evidence of crimes, wrongs, or other acts committed by a person is not admissible to prove that the person acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion or had a propensity to engage in a wrongful act or acts. This evidence may be admissible when it is more probative than prejudicial to prove, for example:\n\nmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or conduct that is inextricably interwoven with the charged acts; or to provide necessary background information or explanation; or to complete the narrative of the subject event or matter.\n\n(2) In a criminal proceeding, where the defendant interposes a defense, the People on rebuttal may prove the defendant's commission of other crimes or wrongs when such crimes or wrongs are relevant and probative to disprove the defense.\n\nSorry. Law nerd. I blame law school.\n\nThe appeals court reaffirmed \"that no person accused of illegality may be judged on proof of uncharged crimes that serve only to establish the accused's propensity for criminal behavior.\"\n\nI love the conclusion: \"The trial court's ruling ran afoul of these time-honored rules of evidence.\"\n\nJudge Singas dissented, arguing the majority's ruling \"perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence and allows predators to escape accountability.\"\n\nExcept...the Molineux Rule is based on a case of a man convicted of MURDER. So, the courts cannot apply the rule in sexual cases?

Burke, was accused of allowing three women who claimed the producer had assaulted them to testify even though they were not part of the charges at hand (under what's called \"Molineux ruling\"). Also, that the 72-year-old Weinstein's right to testify was infringed by allowing prosecutors to cross examine him on unrelated accusations that demonstrated his \"appalling, shameful, repulsive conduct.\"\n\n\"No person accused of illegality may be judged on proof of uncharged crimes that serve only to establish the accused's propensity for criminal behavior,\" the court stated. \"Even if we were to regard the evidence against defendant as 'overwhelming,' there remains a 'significant probability' that, absent the trial court's erroneous Molineux ruling, the jury would have acquitted the defendant.\"\n\nThe 4-3 ruling by the New York Court of Appeals spans 77 pages (including a dissenting opinion). Below are some of the key highlights that explain the majority ruling in regards to how the trial judge handled the case which resulted in this highly controversial decision.\n\n-- \"The accused has a right to be held to account only for the crime charged and, thus, allegations of prior bad acts may not be admitted against them for the sole purpose of establishing their propensity for criminality.\"\n\n-- \"We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose. The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light. The synergistic effect of these errors was not harmless. The only evidence against defendant was the complainants' testimony, and the result of the court's rulings, on the one hand, was to bolster their credibility and diminish defendant's character before the jury. On the other hand, the threat of a cross-examination highlighting these untested allegations undermined defendant's right to testify. The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial.\"\n\n-- \"Indeed, we reject the prosecution's theory ... that this testimony showed defendant's state of mind to use forcible compulsion against complainants and his understanding of their lack of consent. That analysis, if adopted, would eviscerate the time-tested rule against propensity evidence, which, in criminal cases, serves as a judicial bulwark against a guilty verdict based on supposition rather than proof ... or on the defendant's 'bad character' alone ... evidence of a defendant's uncharged crimes or prior misconduct is not admissible if it cannot logically be connected to some specific material issue in the case.\"\n\n-- The additional testimony that the judge permitted were of witnesses saying they refused sexual activity and were attacked, and these situations had differences from the specific instances Weinstein was charged with. \"The complainants' respective testimonies were not 'equivocal' on the issue of consent ... Thus, even though the prosecution contends (and the Appellate Division agreed) that the jury could believe complainants' recollections of the sexual attacks yet still believe that defendant thought they were consenting to the sex, we conclude that such is inconceivable.\"\n\n-- Regarding Weinstein's right to testify: \"The trial court abused its discretion when it ruled\n\nthat the defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross-examined about prior, uncharged alleged bad acts and despicable behavior which was immaterial to his in-court credibility, and which served no purpose other than to display for the jury the defendant's loathsome character. The ruling necessarily and impermissibly impacted defendant's decision whether to take the stand in his defense and thus undermined the fact-finding process in this case, which turned on the credibility of the parties.\"\n\n-- \"The court ruled that the prosecution could ask defendant details about whether he allegedly: verbally abused an employee and also threw food at another worker; bullied, overworked and verbally abused his personal assistant; pulled out of business deals; threw staplers and other objects at people; punched his brother at a business meeting; threatened executives in his office; and photoshopped the head of an actress onto the nude body of another without consent. Without question, this is appalling, shameful, repulsive conduct that could only diminish defendant's character before the jury. But [a prior landmark ruling] does not legitimize destroying a defendant's character under the guise of prosecutorial need.\"\n\n-- Yet a dissenting opinion that was filed slammed the ruling: \"With today's decision, this Court continues to thwart the steady gains survivors of sexual violence have fought for in our criminal justice system. Forgotten are the women who bear the psychological trauma of sexual violence and the scars of testifying again, and again. This erosion of precedent, born from a refusal to accept that crimes of sexual violence are far more nuanced and complex than other crimes, comes at the expense and safety of women.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear if New York will re-charge Weinstein with a new trial.\n\nIn statements to The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein's accusers have slammed the ruling as \"profoundly unjust\" and \"a major step back\" for the #MeToo movement.\n\nDespite the decision, Weinstein will continue serving time in prison due to a Los Angeles Superior Court conviction of the producer raping an Italian model in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hibberd@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "James Hibberd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molineux_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molineux Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex and the law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Admissible evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenting_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dissenting opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court,_Appellate_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Harvey-Weinstein-LA-Court-Hearing-GettyImages-1243724394-H-2024.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513036", "eventUri": "eng-9513036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Douglas H. Wigdor, an attorney representing eight of Weinstein's accusers, including two of the \"prior bad acts\" witnesses at his New York criminal trial, condemned the decision. He stated, \"Today's decision is a major step back in holding those accountable for acts of sexual violence.\"\n\nWigdor continued, \"Courts routinely admit evidence of other uncharged acts where they assist juries in understanding issues concerning the intent, modus operandi, or scheme of the defendant.\" His remarks underscore the ongoing debate regarding the admissibility and relevance of certain evidence in cases involving sexual misconduct.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office has vowed to pursue a retrial, signaling its commitment to seeking justice for survivors of sexual assault. Emily Tuttle, deputy director of communications and senior advisor for the office, stated, \"We will do everything in our power to retry this case.\"\n\nThe Weinstein case is emblematic of broader discussions surrounding the #MeToo movement and its impact on legal proceedings.

Wu, for respondent. Sanctuary for Families Inc., et al., New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, amici curiae. RIVERA, J.: Every person accused of a crime is constitutionally presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial and the opportunity to present a defense (see U.S. Const Amend VI, XIV; NY Const art I, \u00a7 6; Estelle v Williams, 425 US 501, 503 [1976] [\"The right to a fair trial is a fundamental liberty secured by the Fourteenth Amendment\" and \"(t)he presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial -1-\n\n-2- No. 24 under our system of criminal justice\"]; Crane v Kentucky, 476 US 683, 690 [1985] [\"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment . . . the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants 'a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\"\"], quoting California v Trombetta, 467 US 479, 485 [1984]). Under our system of justice, the accused has a right to be held to account only for the crime charged and, thus, allegations of prior bad acts may not be admitted against them for the sole purpose of establishing their propensity for criminality (see People v Molineux, 168 NY 264 [1901]). Nor may the prosecution use \"prior convictions or proof of the prior commission of specific, criminal, vicious or immoral acts\" other than to impeach the accused's credibility (People v Sandoval, 34 NY2d 371, 374 [1974]). It is our solemn duty to diligently guard these rights regardless of the crime charged, the reputation of the accused, or the pressure to convict (see Boyd v United States, 116 US 616, 635 [1886] [\"It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon\"]). Defendant was convicted by a jury for various sexual crimes against three named complainants and, on appeal, claims that he was judged, not on the conduct for which he was indicted, but on irrelevant, prejudicial, and untested allegations of prior bad acts. We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose.

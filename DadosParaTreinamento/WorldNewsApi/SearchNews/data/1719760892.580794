The duo, Akanni Sodiq, 29 and Olamilekan Ridwan, 28, whose addresses were not provided, are charged with conspiracy and armed robbery. The Magistrate, Mr Olaolu Olanipekun, did not take the plea of the defendants for want of jurisdiction. Olanipekun directed the police to return the case file to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) pending legal advice. He, thereafter, adjourned the case till June 28 for mention. The Prosecutor, ASP Anthony Igori, had told the court that the defendants committed the offences on Feb. 27 at about 9 p.m at Amuloko area of Ibadan.

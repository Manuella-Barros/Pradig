Health benefits of regularly consuming ginger Dr Sushma explains that regular consumption of ginger on an empty stomach may help in reducing inflammation, relieving gastrointestinal issues such as bloating and gas, enhancing nutrient absorption, and promoting weight loss. \"Additionally, its antioxidant properties can support overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\" Dr Mickey Mehta, pioneer of holistic health coach says, \u201cSome research studies show that ginger may help regulate the emptying of the stomach, which could potentially help prevent conditions like acid reflux or heartburn.\u201d Potential risks or side effects While ginger is generally safe for most people, consuming it in excessive amounts on an empty stomach may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as heartburn, gas, or diarrhea, mentions Dr Sushma. She advises, \u201cIndividuals with gallstones or those on blood-thinning medications should exercise caution and consult with a healthcare professional before consuming ginger regularly.\u201d Positive effect of ginger Dr Sushma adds that daily consumption of ginger on an empty stomach may provide relief from nausea, morning sickness (in pregnant women), menstrual cramps, arthritis pain, and migraine headaches. Its anti-inflammatory properties can also benefit individuals with conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Dr Mehta concurs and adds, \u201cConsuming it on an empty stomach ensures that the beneficial compounds in ginger are absorbed more efficiently.\u201d Recommended dosage The optimal dosage of ginger, Dr Sushma says, can vary depending on individual tolerance and health condition. Fresh ginger, ginger tea, or ginger supplements can be consumed on an empty stomach. \"It's generally recommended to start with small amounts (around 1 gram) and gradually increase as tolerated.\" When ginger is combined with ingredients like lemon, honey, turmeric, black pepper, it can increase the therapeutic effects, while creating delicious and healthy concoctions, Dr Mehta concludes.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/sipping-brews-different-eat-ginger-empty-stomach-9323580/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/assortment-ginger-wooden-board.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:38:37", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.316}

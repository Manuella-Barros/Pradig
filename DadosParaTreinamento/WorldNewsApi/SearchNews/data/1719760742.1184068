Critics Say He&#8217;s Deflecting from His Own Problems", "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 After the International Criminal Court\u2019s top prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister and top Hamas officials, the Israeli leader accused him of being one of \u201cthe great antisemites in modern times.\u201d As protests roiled college campuses across the United States over the Gaza war, Netanyahu said they were awash with \u201cantisemitic mobs.\u201d These are just two of the many instances during the war in which Netanyahu has accused critics of Israel or his policies of antisemitism, using fiery rhetoric to compare them to the Jewish people\u2019s worst persecutors. But his detractors say he is overusing the label to further his political agenda and try to stifle even legitimate criticism, and that doing so risks diluting the term\u2019s meaning at a time when antisemitism is surging worldwide. \u201cNot every criticism against Israel is antisemitic,\u201d said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian. \u201cThe moment you say it is antisemitic hate \u2026 you take away all legitimacy from the criticism and try to crush the debate.\u201d There has been a spike in antisemitic incidents since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, according to researchers. And many Jews in North America and Europe have said they feel unsafe, citing threats to Jewish schools and synagogues and the pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations in the U.S., although organizers deny that antisemitism drives the protests. The war has reignited the long debate about the definition of antisemitism and whether any criticism of Israel \u2014 from its military\u2019s killing of thousands of Palestinian children to questions over Israel\u2019s very right to exist \u2014 amounts to anti-Jewish hate speech. Netanyahu, the son of a scholar of medieval Jewish persecution, has long used the travails of the Jewish people to color his political rhetoric. And he certainly isn\u2019t the first world leader accused of using national trauma to advance political goals. Netanyahu\u2019s supporters say he is honestly worried for the safety of Jews around the world. But his accusations of antisemitism come as he has repeatedly sidestepped accountability for not preventing Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack. Hamas killed roughly 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, which many in Israel\u2019s defense establishment acknowledge they shoulder the blame for. Netanyahu has continued to face criticism at home and abroad throughout the war, which has killed 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between fighters and noncombatants. The fighting has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe, and ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has accused Netanyahu and his defense minister of using starvation as a \u201cmethod of warfare,\u201d among other crimes. Segev, the historian, acknowledged there is a rise in \u201cviolent hate\u201d toward Israel and, speaking from Vienna, said he wasn\u2019t sure if speaking Hebrew in public was safe. But he said Netanyahu has long used Jewish crises to his political benefit, including invoking the Jewish people\u2019s deepest trauma, the Holocaust, to further his goals. At the height of the campus protests, Netanyahu released a video statement condemning their \u201cunconscionable\u201d antisemitism and comparing the mushrooming encampments on college greens to Nazi Germany of the 1930s. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in America\u2019s college campuses is horrific,\u201d he said. In response to Khan seeking the arrest warrants, he said the ICC prosecutor was \u201ccallously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging across the world,\u201d comparing him to German judges who approved of the Nazis\u2019 race laws against Jews. Those comments drew a rebuke from the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. \u201cThe prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism \u2014 as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu\u2019s government does not like,\u201d Borrell said. \u201cThe word antisemitic, it\u2019s too heavy. It\u2019s too important.\u201d Netanyahu has compared accusations that Israel\u2019s war is causing starvation in Gaza or that the war is genocidal to blood libels \u2014 unfounded centuries-old accusations that Jews sacrificed Christian children and used their blood to make unleavened bread for Passover. \u201cThese false accusations are not levelled against us because of the things we do, but because of the simple fact that we exist,\u201d he said at a ceremony marking Israel\u2019s Holocaust Remembrance Day earlier this month. Netanyahu previously made repeated allusions to the Holocaust while trying to galvanize the world against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Israeli leaders and the country\u2019s media also made such comparisons about Oct. 7, describing the Hamas attackers as Nazis, comparing their rampage to the historic violence inflicted on Eastern European Jews, and referring to the images of Jewish victims\u2019 burned bodies as a Shoah \u2014 the Hebrew word for Holocaust. Israelis have been jarred by the global rise in antisemitism, and many view the swell of criticism against Israel as part of the rise. They see hypocrisy in the world\u2019s intense focus on Israel\u2019s war with Hamas while other conflicts get much less attention. Moshe Klughaft, a former advisor to Netanyahu, said he believes the Israeli leader is genuinely concerned over rising antisemitism. \u201cIt is his duty to condemn antisemitism as prime minister of Israel and as head of a country that sees itself as responsible for world Jewry,\u201d he said. Many Israelis view the war in Gaza as a just act of self-defense and are befuddled by what many think should be criticism directed at Hamas \u2014 blaming the group for starting the war, using Palestinian civilians as human shields and refusing to free the hostages. The ICC warrant requests have likely bolstered such feelings. When Netanyahu leans on accusations of antisemitism, he is doing so with the Israeli public in mind, said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University. Hazan said Netanyahu has leveraged the campus protests, for example, to get Israelis to rally around him at a time when his public support has plummeted and Israelis are growing impatient with the war. He said Netanyahu has also used the protests as a scapegoat for his failure so far to achieve the war\u2019s two goals: destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. \u201cHe deflects blame from himself, attributing any shortcomings not to his foreign policies or policies in the (Palestinian) territories, but rather to antisemitism. This narrative benefits him greatly, absolving him of responsibility,\u201d Hazan said. Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem think thank, rejects the notion that Netanyahu stifles criticism by calling it antisemitic, pointing to just how much criticism the country receives. But he said using the antisemitic label to achieve political ends could cheapen it. \u201cI\u2019d be more selective than the government of Israel in choosing the people and bodies they tag \u2018antisemitic,\u2019\u201d he said. \u2014 By TIA GOLDENBERG Associated Press", "summary": "<p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 After the International Criminal Court\u2019s top prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/netanyahu-frequently-makes-claims-of-antisemitism-critics-say-hes-deflecting-from-his-own-problems/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Netanyahu Frequently Makes Claims of Antisemitism.

Monday saw 22 FIRs, and two on Sunday.\n\nNoida police registered five FIRs against the vehicles' owners and seized nine vehicles driven by minors.\n\nGhaziabad police commissioner Ajay Kumar Mishra said FIRs have been registered under BNS Section 125 (endangering life or personal safety of others) and Section 199A of the Motor Vehicles Act.\n\nSection 199A of the MV Act says that the guardian of a minor or the owner of the vehicle will be punished if road norms are violated by a minor. This law is punishable with a fine of Rs 25,000, three years in jail, or both. The vehicle's registration can be cancelled for 12 months as well, and the minor cannot get a licence till 25 years of age.\n\nConviction under Section 125 of BNS is punishable with imprisonment up to 3 months, or fine, or both.\n\nNo arrests have been made so far, but police will submit a charge sheet and then take further action.\n\nMishra said that some of the underage drivers told cops they were running errands for their family, or they were on their way to school or coaching classes. \"We will ask education institutions and coaching centres to take action against those students who come on bikes or cars,\" Mishra said.\n\nIn Noida, DCP (traffic) Anil Kumar Yadav said police got a directive from Lucknow to address the problem of underage driving. \"We are conducting enforcement drives outside schools and academic institutions in Noida and Greater Noida. It will go on till July 20,\" Yadav said.\n\nUnderage driving isn't uncommon in Indian cities. Last month, the son of a prominent realtor in Pune ran over two youngsters while driving his father's Porsche at 150 kmph. He was suspected to have been inebriated at the time.\n\nIn 2020, senior finance executive Alok Gupta died in Gurgaon when an Ecosport being driven by a minor jumped across the road divider and barrelled into Gupta's bike. Family and friends of Gupta had subsequently campaigned against underage driving on the streets of Gurgaon with his wife Mihika leading calls for a change in the law to ensure stringent punishment for drunk and underage drivers.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaziabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghaziabad"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Old Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaziabad,_Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Mishra_Teni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Mishra Teni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_of_police_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent of police (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Noida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Noida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Noida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurgaon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Driving", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Driving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts_in_Kind", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts in Kind", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111644573,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206956,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721759", "eventUri": "eng-9721759", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "dateEnd": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 440, "textEnd": 456}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1998, "textEnd": 2005}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

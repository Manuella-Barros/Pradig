South Africa defeated Australia in the pool stage during their famous victory on home soil in 1995, before Australia got revenge by knocking them out in the semi-finals at the 1999 tournament.\n\nThe next meeting at a World Cup came in New Zealand in 2011, where Australia secured a narrow 11-9 victory in Wellington to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThe last meeting between the sides came at last year's Rugby Championship, with South Africa comfortably winning 43-12 in Pretoria.\n\nFans will be able to watch both Wallabies vs Springboks Tests on free-to-air via Channel Nine and 9GEM, as well as the company's streaming platform 9Now.\n\nStan Sport will also be offering all of The Rugby Championship, as well as every other Wallabies match to stream live and on demand without ad-breaks during play.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rugby_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Rugby Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Schmidt_(rugby_union)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Schmidt (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_McReight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraser McReight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_Koroibete", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marika Koroibete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9Gem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "9Gem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-air", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free-to-air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nine Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pretoria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pretoria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Indoor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/Wallabies%20springboks.png?itok=RKy_TpVd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805015", "eventUri": "eng-9805015", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

You need an element of structure because you need to know where people are going to be.\n\nSo, if you look back at our games last year, during the Rugby Championship, we got turned over the most at the rucks out of any team in the Rugby Championship.\n\nAnd that was just because we were all second guessing, like no one knew if they were supposed to be at a ruck...\n\nSo what I've noticed with the guys now, from this year, is obviously they've implemented the structure back into it.\n\nAnd I think that the upside is that a lot of the boys also have the ability to play how we were playing last year with a little bit more freedom in the sense of if there's zero structure at all, you're going to start throwing the balls.\n\nThe next few weeks will certainly be a big test of the early progress Australia have made under Joe Schmidt, with two away games in Argentina to come alongside the tests with South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nAs a result, a good finish in this year's Rugby Championship is far from a guarantee.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Schmidt_(rugby_union)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Schmidt (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jones_(rugby_union)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jones (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rugby_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Rugby Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_O'Driscoll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian O'Driscoll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quade_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quade Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wOFxcXC8wOTE2NDA1MFxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wOC0wOVQxNjM5MDYuOTQxLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJiMjk2ODJiOWIyY2ExMmYyYWU0ODdmM2E1NDQzOWJhN2VhZWFkOGQwIn0=/australialegendsaysjoeschmidthasbinnedcrazytacticusedbyeddiejonesballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805015", "eventUri": "eng-9805015", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

At RWC 2023 the Wallabies hit rock bottom and, astonishingly, they just kept digging.\n\nLovers of the Wallabies were forced to endure a cringeworthy, B-grade soap opera that was the result of two decades of incompetent governance from consecutive boards in charge of Rugby Australia (RA).\n\nMonths before last year's World Cup, against the wishes of both the Wallaby players and some rugby people on the RA board, then head coach Dave Rennie was removed and replaced with Eddie Jones. The chaos that the rugby people on the RA board had predicted would occur if Jones was appointed came to pass.\n\nJones sacked the Wallabies talismanic leader Michael Hooper and made massive changes to the staff that created a deep lack of clarity in the team's game plan literally weeks before the World Cup.\n\nWith the experienced leaders left at home, the young players parachuted into the team were not prepared for the rigours of the international game. In the pool matches of RWC 2023 the men in gold were shredded in a record defeat to Wales and a historic loss to Fiji. For the first time in World Cup history, the Wallabies missed the quarter-finals. After promising a four-year rebuild, Jones packed his bags and took off for Tokyo, dumping the Wallabies to coach the Cherry Blossoms.\n\nEnter Joe Schmidt.\n\nSchmidt was not the people's choice for the role. Australian rugby has suffered from a string of wrongly recruited Kiwis, either as coaches or chief executives, who have disastrously driven the game in Australia so far away from its DNA that players of this generation have lost their understanding of Australian rugby's unique identity. So it is understandable that the Aussie locals are highly sceptical of yet another New Zealander getting the gig as the Wallabies boss.\n\nWhen a leading RA official asked me for my opinion of Schmidt coaching the Wallabies, I told him that Schmidt is one of the best coaches I have ever seen but he badly lost his way in 2019. However, good coaches can learn from their errors and I believe that in time Joe will be a huge positive for the Wallabies.\n\nThe vast majority of Wallaby supporters do not have the same opinion and they sit firmly in the \"Doubting Thomas\" category. They need to see a lot of wins before they will believe in Schmidt.\n\nSuccess will be a struggle for Schmidt because the production line of Australian world-class creative halves has simply stopped.\n\nFor half a century the Wallabies were renowned for their exceptional halves that could create space and then exploit it. Nick Farr-Jones, George Gregan, Mark Ella, Michael Lynagh and Stephen Larkham are all-time greats.\n\nOver the past two decades, their legacy has been abandoned by coaches who imposed a Kiwi style of play on to young Australian halves. This has resulted in them losing their understanding of how to play a uniquely Australian style of game.\n\nNone of this was of Schmidt's making but it is his deepest problem. As they say in boxing, you can only punch with the fists you have, and Schmidt can only select the players at his disposal.\n\nPerhaps it will be the introduction of several new trial laws that the world will see for the first time in the Rugby Championship that may slightly negate some of the effects of the Boks tactics.\n\nThe long overdue introduction of a 30-second shot clock for the assembly of scrums and lineouts will be implemented. At long last, 40 years after it was first introduced in Australia in the mid-1980s, at scrums the defending scrumhalf will not be allowed to follow the ball through the scrum. Combined, the hope is scrums will assemble faster and the ball will reach the backlines. Both are rare events under the current structures of the laws.\n\nThe controversial new red-card law will also be in use. At the officials' discretion, when a player receives a red card and cannot return to play, he can be replaced after 20 minutes.\n\nThese are positive law changes that should have been implemented a decade ago and are a direct reaction to the Springboks' game plan that is centred around playing the game in brief explosive bursts followed by long periods of inactivity to allow their giant frames to recover. This style of play produces games with minuscule ball-in-play (BIP) times.\n\nA previous match between the Wallabies and the Boks in Adelaide created only 28 minutes BIP time while the recent first test between the Boks and Ireland produced only 30 minutes of BIP time.\n\nThese BIP times are totally unacceptable for players, spectators and TV audiences.\n\nAustralian rugby supporters are a resilient bunch. Even with the Wallabies being basement dwellers, Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium is a sell-out. Hope springs eternal inside those who love the wattle green and gold jersey.\n\nWith all its flaws and logistic improbabilities the Rugby Championship is back, and no matter what they say in the north, the rugby people of the south love it.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We know that we can't win the Rugby Championship by winning these two games (in Australia), but we know that we can lose it by not doing well in them,\" explained Kolisi at Friday's pre-match press conference.\n\n\"We've worked hard since we arrived here and we know what we are up against, so stressing about the record (here in the past) won't help. Our focus is on what we must do on the field, and we know it's going to be challenging.\"\n\nThe previous three Rugby Championships have all been won by the All Blacks, with them winning all three of their games in 2023's shortened version.\n\nIn the previous two full versions, in 2022 the All Blacks won four out of six games, the same as the Boks, but edged the competition thanks to an extra bonus point, while in 2021 they comfortably won with five wins, with their only loss coming against the Boks that year.\n\nThese two games in Australia are thus vitally important for the Boks and they will be desperate to start with a win at a stadium that they have won at only once in 12 attempts.\n\nDespite not being considered a challenger for the Rugby Championship, the Wallabies will be eager to keep improving, after a dismal run of form in recent years, while they will also be keen to keep up their impressive home record against the Boks, in front of a packed home crowd.\n\n\"We expect a side that's going to come out to win. It's a sold-out stadium, they have the people behind them. We've seen how well they did against Wales and Georgia,\" said Kolisi.\n\n\"We know it will be a huge thing for them if they can get a win over us. That honestly hasn't been our focus.

It will attempt to rectify that discrepancy in this season's tournament which begins when the Springboks play Australia at Brisbane on Saturday.\n\nThe All Blacks host Argentina later the same day in Wellington as the Southern Hemisphere nations enter a new phase of the rebuilding process that has followed the last World Cup in France in 2023 in which South Africa beat New Zealand in the final.\n\nAll four teams have played three tests so far this season, using July internationals to introduce new players and in the case of Argentina, Australia and New Zealand to get used to new systems under new head coaches.\n\nAustralia (Joe Schmidt) and New Zealand (Scott Robertson) both are unbeaten so far under those coaches. Australia won mid-year tests against Wales and Georgia while New Zealand beat England twice and Fiji once.\n\nArgentina under Felipe Contempomi split a two-test series with France and beat Uruguay by a record margin. South Africa won one and lost one test against Ireland in a series between the two top-ranked teams in world rugby -- the Springboks won the first match against Ireland 27-20 before losing the second 25-24 -- and then beat Portugal 64-21.\n\nSouth Africa director of rugby Rassie Erasmus used the mid-year tests to induct a number of newcomers into the Springboks lineup and on Saturday will hand starting debuts to 22-year-old flyhalf Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu and backrower Elrigh Louw.\n\nOtherwise, there are only three changes to the team that faced Ireland in a move which appears to underline the Springboks' seriousness about this year's Championship.\n\nSouth Africa hasn't always placed a high emphasis on the Rugby Championship which, since 2019, has been won four times by New Zealand.\n\nBut this year is determined to play up to its top world ranking in two matches against Australia in Australia and in two home tests against the All Blacks. The Springboks, who also won the World Cup in Japan in 2019, play Argentina home and away.\n\n\"As we tell ourselves internally, we can't look too far ahead and forget the present. We also just can't look at the present and I think in the squad you can see that,\" Erasmus said, explaining his selection. \"I think there are nine guys in the squad that weren't regulars prior to the World Cup last year.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it is the changing of the guard. It is about giving guys an opportunity . . . \"\n\nErasmus said Feinberg-Mngomezulu \"is starting at No. 10 and No. 10 is pivotal in every test match. \"But he is somebody we know well. He is not someone who has just fallen into our system.\"\n\nSchmidt also has introduced many new players as he works to rebuild the Wallabies after last year's poor performances, highlighted by their early demise at the World Cup when they failed to make it out of the group stage for the first time.\n\nSo far, so good. The Wallabies played with confidence against Wales, given license by Schmidt to express themselves. Their revival has drawn a sellout 50,000-plus crowd to Saturday's match in Brisbane.\n\nSchmidt said his Wallabies team for the match mixes \"continuity with freshness.\"\n\n\"The players have worked with good enthusiasm during the week but we know there is still plenty to work on,\" he said. \"We're conscious of the size of the challenge and the size of our opponents but there's a keenness in the player group to take a step forward.\"\n\nThe All Blacks managed, just, to see off England in two tests, winning the first by a point and the second by the margin of a converted try. Their match against Fiji in San Diego allowed Robertson to test a number of new players, though he has reverted to his best lineup on Saturday.\n\nThere are some questions still over leadership on the field and imagination in the coaching box. The All Blacks face issues at scrumhalf where the loss of Aaron Smith's long pass has repercussions on attack and at lock where injuries have opened the way for one-test All Black Sam Darry to start on Saturday.\n\nArgentina will field several players who did not take part in the July tests. Juan Mart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, Juan Cruz Mall\u00eda and Lucio Cinti have been named in the starting 15 while Agust\u00edn Creevy, Joel Sclavi and Tom\u00e1s Lavanini are on the bench. Efra\u00edn El\u00edas, who also is among the reserves, is set for a test debut.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

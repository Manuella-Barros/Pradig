decided as Irish road death toll reaches grim milestone following Waterford crash", "body": "The death of a woman in Waterford yesterday was the 100th road fatality so far this year, 13 higher than the same period in 2023.\n\nThe government is to receive recommendations on the future of the Road Safety Authority in the coming weeks, according to Finance Minister Jack Chambers.\n\nThe news came in response to the news of the death of a woman in her 70s following a two-vehicle collision in Waterford this morning.\n\nThe collision, involving a truck and a car, happened at around 9.20am on the N25 at Garranbane, near Dungarvan in Co Waterford.\n\nThe driver of the car, a woman in her 70s, was treated by emergency services at the scene but later died from her injuries.\n\nThe driver of the truck meanwhile has been taken to Waterford University Hospital where he is receiving treatment for injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening.\n\nThe woman's death marks a grim figure, as it is the 100th road fatality so far this year, 13 higher than the same period in 2023.\n\nThere has been an strong political focus on the number of road deaths in Ireland due to an increase in fatalities, incidents of drink and drug driving and other road behaviours.\n\nMinister for Finance Jack Chambers, who had been a junior minister in the Department of Transport, conveyed his condolences and said this year had seen \"a shocking continuation of the trend that we saw last year\".\n\n\"We passed important road safety legislation earlier on this year, some of which is commenced.\n\n\"There is an important body of work around the future of the Road Safety Authority and I'm certain that interim recommendations, which could be brought to government in the coming weeks, which are examining how the Road Safety Authority can be best placed to fulfil its remit for road safety in the future.\"\n\nPublic Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, a former Minister of Transport, added: \"I appreciate how hugely important road safety is and I'm conscious of the further progress that we need to make.\"", "source": {"uri": "dundalkdemocrat.ie", "dataType": "news",

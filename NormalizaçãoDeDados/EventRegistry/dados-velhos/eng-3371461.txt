However, political gossips in Odisha are on high ahead of this meeting.\n\nState Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout, however, criticized this meeting and said though Dharmendra Pradhan is a Minister of State and CM is superior to him as per the protocol, Naveen could have called him here to discuss over the issue instead of meeting him in Delhi. He also said, \"State Government had already signed an MoU with IOCL regarding the subsidized tax issue and hence should meet the officials of IOCL on the breaching of MoU, rather than meeting the Minister\".\n\nEven though the officials of IOCL and Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry had more than couple of meetings with the Chief Secretary of Odisha along with other officials regarding the same issue, nothing was finalized.\n\nSpeculations fuel up over BJD-NDA alliance ahead of the meet as recently the saffron party has successfully got a hold of Bihar in alliance with the JDU and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu.\n\nWho is meeting whom at Odisha Bhawan? Whether it's Dharmendra Pradhan who has arranged the meeting upon CM's request or it's the CM who is meeting Pradhan on later's request, is yet to be known.\n\nRelated Items:Dharmendra Pradhan, IOCL, meeting, Naveen Patnaik, New Delhi, Paradip Refinery", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 275, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 100, "id": 851, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54715"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55084"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneshwar"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneshwar"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55103"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323194"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(United)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324697", "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (United)"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329453", "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Patnaik", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "337135", "label": {"eng": "Naveen Patnaik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmendra_Pradhan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "350094", "label": {"eng": "Dharmendra Pradhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Petroleum_and_Natural_Gas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "362114", "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Janata_Dal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "372040", "label": {"eng": "Biju Janata Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Oil_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "400268", "label": {"eng": "Indian Oil Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradip_Refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1436848", "label": {"eng": "Paradip Refinery"}}]}

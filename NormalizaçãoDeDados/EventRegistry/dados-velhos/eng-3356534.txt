firefighter is riding a motorbike away from a forest fire next to the village of Macao, near Castelo Branco, Portugal, July 26, 2017. -- Reuters picABRANTES, Aug 12 -- Portugal was battling a new rash of forest fires ahead of a weekend of warm temperatures, as authorities warned of further blazes.\n\nSome 1,800 firefighters backed by hundreds of vehicles were trying to douse around 10 fires across the country, authorities said yesterday.\n\n\"Despite the relentless fires, the situation is now more stable,\" said civil protection agency spokeswoman Patricia Gaspar in Lisbon.\n\nEmergency workers had nearly gained control of wildfires across Portugal's drought-hit central region on Thursday, but stronger winds fanned flames in several areas.\n\nIn the village of Bracal, flames were being blown towards houses as residents grabbed what they could to aid firefighters, an AFP journalist said.\n\nSome residents voiced anger at authorities after a season of repeated wildfires which have stretched resources.\n\n\"Firefighters can't perform miracles, they are exhausted,\" said Lucia Ricardo, who lives in Bracal, close to the central town of Abrantes.\n\nSix villages had been evacuated around Abrantes on Thursday as fire-dousing planes flew sorties over the flames.\n\nAnother blaze near Grandola, in the southern Setubal district, needed 200 firefighters to bring it under control after burning through around 3,000 hectares (30 square kilometres) of forest.\n\nThe fires come after more than 60 people were killed in June, and more than 200 injured, in a giant blaze at Pedrogao Grande in central Portugal that raged for five days.\n\nAfter an uncommonly dry winter and spring, almost 79 per cent of the Portuguese mainland was enduring extreme or severe drought at the end of July, according to the national weather office.\n\nDry conditions have also fuelled fires on France's Mediterranean coast and on the island of Corsica in recent weeks.\n\nAlmost 700 people, mostly holidaymakers, were evacuated from two areas in Corsica last night because of fires fanned by strong winds. -- AFP", "timeCrawl": "05:50:00", "sim": 0.9411764740943909, "extractedDates": [{"date":

As the clock struck 12 on the night of August 14, the dinner menu at an iconic hotel in what was then Bombay doffed its cap to a newly independent nation.\n\nThe menu -- mainly consisting of Indo-French dishes -- has been recreated at some Taj hotels across the country to celebrate 70 years of the country's independence.\n\n\"While flipping through the archives of Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai one of our associates found the menu from the night of independence. It was shared with head chefs as a valuable piece of history,\" says Rajesh Wadhwa, Executive Chef at Taj Palace Delhi.\n\nThe hotel in the city carefully curated the menu while keeping in mind the ingredients and methods used then, but giving it a modern Indian twist.\n\nThe menu, priced at Rs 1947, includes an array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes celebrating independence -- such as the Consomme a L'indienne\" or the \"Indian consomme\", \"Vacherin de peches liberation\" and \"Poularde Souffle Independence\". It will be on offer till August 14.\n\n\"We have retained the Indo-French touches not only in the names of the dishes but also in the core French sauces. We are also presenting the food in sync with the culinary traditions of that year,\" says Wadhwa.\n\nThe three-course meal includes a classic French bouillon broth with chicken, flavoured with cardamom and pepper, a smoked creamy almond soup, \"Delices a l'hindustan\"- tamarind flavoured cottage cheese tikkas -- and the souffle independence -- a fluffy three-egg omelette with chicken. The \"Paupiette De Saumon Joinville\" is pink salmon coated with white sauce and garnished with herbs.\n\n\"We did research into how to localise this menu. It took us around ten days to create this elaborated spread. The challenge was to present our guests with a menu which is certainly dated and reminiscent of different times,\" he says.\n\nThe Taj is also offering all serving and retired Indian Armed Forces personnel a special discount of 70 per cent across its hotels in India.\n\n\"The Taj has been a proud partner in India's journey for Independence. In 1903, our founder Jamsetji Tata built the Taj Mahal Palace hotel as a tribute to India in its journey towards economic and industrial independence,\" says Chinmai Sharma, Chief Revenue Officer, Taj Hotels Palaces Resorts Safaris.\n\nLord Louis Mountbatten, who was the country's first Governor-General, bid farewell to India from the steps of the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai in 1948.\n\nIndependence was ushered in with music, dancing, speeches and merry-making, the hotel states in a release.\n\n\"Everyone was very happy and gay,\" it quotes from its archives a guest, Catherine Courtney, as saying.\n\n\"We were dancing round madly. At midnight the lights went out and D. F. Karaka, who then owned the Current Weekly, got up and made a little speech. Then the lights came on again and behind him there was the Indian national flag lit up in lights... Outside the Taj the streets were absolutely packed with people,\" she said.\n\nThe guest recalled seeing \"hundreds of people\" coming up the stairs.\n\n\"They were all happy and gay and I said, 'Jai Hind' and they said, 'Jai Hind'\".\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "timeCrawl": "13:17:00", "sim": 0.9372549057006836, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 59, "date": "2017-08-14", "textStart": 50}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8919295", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "id": 773, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It covered requests for firefighting airplanes and firemen and is part of a European mechanism for cooperation to fight fires.\n\nEmergency services said 268 fires broke out yesterday, the highest number for any single day this year, with 6,500 firemen fighting to put them out.

Exceptionally dry and hot weather ignited Portugal's worst fire disaster in memory early this summer, killing 64 people, and fires have continued to flare up in recent weeks with the arrival of each new hotter spell of weather.\n\nInterior Minister Constanca Urbana de Sousa said the country sent the request for help to Europe late on Saturday because of concerns that high temperatures and high winds in the coming days could increase the number of fires.\n\nThe minister said the request was carried out \"because of a question of prudence\" due to the weather forecast for coming days, according to news agency Lusa. It covered requests for firefighting airplanes and firemen and is part of a European mechanism for cooperation to fight fires. Emergency services said 268 fires broke out on Saturday, the highest number for any single day this year, with 6,500 firemen fighting to put them out. There are fears that many of them could flare up again later on Sunday, with higher winds and temperatures that hit in the afternoon.

But the country could face many more weeks of fires before the end of summer. More than 140,000 hectares of forest have burned this summer in Portugal, more than three times higher than the average over the last 10 years, according to European Union data.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Portugal", "timeCrawl": "14:22:00", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 33, "amb": false, "textEnd": 48}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8926417", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "id": 106, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "id": 109, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "id": 401, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

70-year-old celebratory menu served on the night of India's independence from its archives\n\nDelices al 'Hindustan (Vegetable Galouti and Paneer ki Gandheri served in shot glasses) Pics/Tanvi Phondekar\n\nFlipping through the archives of Taj Mahal Palace & Towers, Colaba, Amit Chowdhury, the executive chef, found a menu crafted for the night of August 14, 1947, titled Independence Night.\n\nThe venue has been privy to many historic moments for the country, with Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten giving his last speech on the steps of the hotel.\n\nIn its 70th year, the Independence Night 2017 menu, to be served from August 12 to 15, begins with Consomme al'Indienne. \"I have given the classic French bouillon broth a twist of tamatar shorba. The clear soup is flavoured with jeera, spice and coriander,\" he explains. For those wanting something more classic, the Veloute d'Amandes is a milky-thick Cream of Almonds.\n\nVacherin de Peches Liberartion\n\nThe hotel was headed by French chefs during the British Rule and many Indian apprentices trained under them. It is likely that the original menu was spearheaded by then Goan-Christian head chef Minguel Arcanjo Mascarenha, who, along with apprentices, had trained under the French masters. They developed their own interpretation of Indo-French cuisine for the celebratory meal. \"Back then, you mainly had Goan and Bengali Christian chefs, as the profession was not as popular as it is today,\" says Chowdhury, who joined the hotel in 1985.\n\n\"Mascarenhas was the bridge between the French masters and the Indian chefs later. After Independence, Indian elements started coming in, and people didn't want the bland French food. The menu does not mention the ingredients nor recipes. So, I have been using classic techniques that would have been used then.\"\n\nLord Mountbatten speaks at the Taj, two days after indepdendence\n\nThe menu moves on to Delices al 'Hindustan. \"This means 'delicate bites of Hindustan'. There were no tandoors then. The grilling technique came to India when Partition refugees from Pakistan arrived in North India,\" he says.\n\nTwo succulent tava kebabs in the form of chicken mince on sugarcane stick arrive. For vegetarians, there is a Galouti and a Paneer ki Gandheri.\n\nA classic salmon Paupillete de Saumon Joinville in Veloute sauce topped with crayfish butter classic follows. The fish is flaky and the sauce, buttery. For Poularde Souffle Independence, he created a chicken mince mousse and stuffed it in a chicken breast and served it with pan jus. \"Earlier, it would be served with green peas and carrots. It was the post-World War era and resources were rationed. We have adapted the menu with English veggies such as asparagus, peppers and broccoli. By the way, did you know that the French never believed in vegetarian dishes,\" he tells us.\n\nChef Amit Choudhary\n\nThe dessert is Vacherin de Peches Liberartion, a chewy almond meringue filled with a peach compote with wine, and topped with sorbet. Originally, it was served with sharbat, Chowdhury points out, adding that then, they would not care about how the food was served on the plate. \"We have stuck to classic plating techniques to give a feel of the ancient times.\"\n\nWe end the meal with Friandises, a sweet assortment of bon, acting as a palate cleanser before the coffee arrives.\n\nAlso see: Then and Now: Smriti Irani's journey from a model to Union Minister\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOn 1 Jan 1916, a meeting at the Taj between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League (probably hosted at Taj because League President the Nawab of Mahmudabad was staying in a suit there) led to an alliance which led to a common goal: the self-government of India.

It covered requests for firefighting airplanes and firemen and is part of a European mechanism for cooperation to fight fires.\n\nEmergency services said 268 fires broke out on Saturday, the highest number for any single day this year, with 6,500 firemen fighting to put them out. There are fears that many of them could flare up again later on Sunday, with higher winds and temperatures that hit in the afternoon.\n\nThe central district of Coimbra adopted a local state of emergency to deal with fires, as did four smaller municipalities in the region.\n\nWhile fires have burned through the summer none has had the tragic impact of the one in late June, as emergency services have gone to far greater efforts to evacuate villages and shut roads early in affected areas.\n\nBut the country could face many more weeks of fires before the end of summer.\n\nMore than 140,000 hectares of forest have burned this summer in Portugal, more than three times higher than the average over the last 10 years, according to European Union data.

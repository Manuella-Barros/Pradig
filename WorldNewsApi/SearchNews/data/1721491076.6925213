Created by oOh!media, Samsung, Spark Foundry and Tribal, the out of home campaign used a push-button interactive build, changing the way audiences engage with outdoor advertising. The campaign was brought to life with five special builds in key locations across Auckland T\u0101maki Makaurau, Wellington Te Whanganui-a-Tara, and Christchurch \u014ctautahi. Commuters were encouraged to interact with the campaign by simply pushing a button, triggering an instant enhancement of blurred visuals into sharp clarity.

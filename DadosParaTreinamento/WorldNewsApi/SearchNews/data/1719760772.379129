Mervyn Kersh was summoned by his commanding officer and threatened with arrest. Why, the officer demanded, had Kersh refused to eat his army rations of canned beef and vegetables, subsisting only on canned peaches? Was he trying to make himself so weak that he would be unfit to fight in France? Kersh, then 19, was indignant. \u201cI said that was the last thing I wanted to do,\u2019\u2019 Kersh told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m Jewish. I didn\u2019t eat anything that wasn\u2019t kosher as far as I could help it.\u2019\u2019 The officer dropped the charge and Kersh was soon on board a landing ship approaching the Normandy coast with artillery shells from Allied ships and German shore batteries screaming overhead. The sense of adventure turned to fear, Kersh recalled, and he sought comfort from a pocket edition of \u201cThe Book of Psalms\u201d before landing in France a few days after D-Day, which on June 6, 1944. Kersh will return to France next week for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings and the Battle of Normandy that followed. It\u2019s expected to be one of the last big events commemorating the campaign to end the Nazis\u2019 grip on Northern Europe, with the dwindling number of surviving veterans now approaching or past their 100th birthdays. Growing up in a Jewish family in south London during the 1930s and \u201940s, Kersh, now 99, was doubly motivated to defeat Adolf Hitler. In addition to the threat to Britain and the bombing that killed almost 30,000 people in the capital, there was the knowledge that the Nazis were slaughtering Jews across Europe. \u201cI could almost say it was a crusade, if that\u2019s not the wrong word,\u201d Kersh said. \u201cTo me, this had a purpose. It wasn\u2019t just a game or passing the time. \u2026 It was to put the Germans out of action as long as possible.\u201d \u201cWe knew what was happening. (We) didn\u2019t know the extent of it, but we knew they had gas chambers. They were killing people, shooting them, hanging them.\u201d That motivation translated into an above average level of military service for British Jews during World War II. About 70,000 Jews, or 18% of the Jewish population, served in the U.K. armed forces during the war, compared with 11% for the population as a whole. Both Britain and the U.S. benefitted from large Jewish populations that were highly motivated to defeat Nazi Germany and provided a pool of recruits who had valuable language skills and other knowledge that the Allies needed for the war effort, said Rob Citino, a retired senior historian at The National WWII Museum in New Orleans. Henry Kissinger, for example, was born in Germany, fled to London with his family, then moved to New York where he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Kissinger served in counterintelligence during the advance into Germany, helping to arrest saboteurs and Gestapo secret police operatives. \u201cIf there\u2019s ever a soldier who is going to fight with spirit in the field against the Nazis, of course it would be a Jewish-American or an Anglo Jewish citizen of the British Isles,\u201d Citino said. Assigned to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Kersh\u2019s role in the invasion was to help ensure a steady flow of vehicles \u2014 everything from motorcycles to 48-wheel tank transporters \u2014 to British Army units fighting their way to Berlin. Advancing across Europe, he saw for himself what the war had meant for Jews. There were the people in Bayeux, France, who came out of hiding to hear a rabbi deliver a service for Jewish troops, and in Brussels, two black-hatted men told Kersh how they had spent four years in one tiny room, surviving on the meager rations a neighbor shared with them. But it was at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp that he saw the true horrors of the war. British troops liberated the camp on April 15, 1945, finding 60,000 starving prisoners and thousands of unburied bodies. When Kersh arrived in the area a few weeks later to await a transfer, he visited the camp. He wasn\u2019t allowed to enter because of the danger of typhus, but outside the gates he met skeleton-like former prisoners still wearing their striped prison uniforms. Kersh tried to help, collecting chocolate rations from other soldiers and passing them onto the survivors whose eyes lit up at the sight of food they hadn\u2019t seen for years. But that act of kindness makes him pause almost 80 years later. \u201cI found out afterwards that that was the worst thing you could give starving people,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many died from that? I don\u2019t know. But I didn\u2019t know it at the time.\u2019\u2019 After his years in the army, including a stint in Egypt after the war, Kersh found his dream of becoming a retail store manager blocked by employers who thought he was too old to join a training program at the age of 22. He ultimately found success pioneering the market for fake fur coats and as a writer. But in recent years, his vocation has become visiting schools and community groups to tell his story, reminding younger generations about the dangers of antisemitism and what can happen if world leaders don\u2019t stand up to tyrants. The French government in 2015 awarded Kersh the Legion d\u2019Honneur, the country\u2019s highest order of merit, for his participation in the Normandy campaign. And five years later, then U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson honored Kersh for his \u201ctireless efforts\u201d to reach out to young people. Eight decades after he rolled onto Gold Beach in a tracked personnel carrier, Kersh is the first to admit that he had an easier path than the men who splashed through the surf facing a fusillade of gunfire and mortar shells in the days before him. And he recognizes that he is being feted in part because he\u2019s one of the last men standing from the campaign to liberate Europe. But that makes it all the more important to him to tell the story. \u201cWhen I go back, each time I go back, and look at the military cemeteries, I just think how lucky I am, because I\u2019ve got the choice of going home again,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd they haven\u2019t. They just lost their lives, but it was for something worthwhile, if that\u2019s any compensation.\u201d Danica Kirka, The Associated Press", "summary": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Even as he prepared to embark for the battlefields of Normandy, Pvt.

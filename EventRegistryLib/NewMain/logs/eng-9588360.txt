Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Powerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through a small Iowa town Tuesday, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nMultiple people were injured in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, said Iowa State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Alex Dinkla. He didn't know the extent of the injuries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines.

Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before. (JJ Unger via AP)\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3 Mason City"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before. (JJ Unger via AP)\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Powerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through a small Iowa town Tuesday, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nMultiple people were injured in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, said Iowa State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Alex Dinkla. He didn't know the extent of the injuries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3 Mason City"}, "authors": [{"uri":

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2000 around 88km southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the grey and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 76m wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 88km/h. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimise the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbours help neighbours, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2pm ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 56km/h and 74km/h hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move 1.8m deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms on Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised on Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

BECK Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 nearly 90 kilometres southwest of the state capital of Des Moines.\n\nThe twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.\n\nCars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the grey and overcast sky.\n\nTrees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves.\n\nResidents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said.\n\n\"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 76-metre wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but few details were immediately available.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbours help neighbours, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. local time ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the U.S. National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the weather service's storm prediction centre gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and cancelled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Neb., awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky.

Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays.

The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Wind gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Steve Karnowski, Josh Funk,

(JJ Unger via AP)\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

BECK Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla says at least a dozen people were injured amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, Iowa.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield and left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees, while outside the small town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds.\n\nAfter devastating the town of 2,000 residents, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets - before the storm - and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nDrone footage shows destruction caused by tornado in Greenfield, Iowa.\n\nThe Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-metre) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smoulder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the UA Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbours help neighbours, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and cancelled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummelled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot (15.24-centimeter) deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nDevastating tornadoes flatten homes in Nebraska and Iowa as storm threat grows 'dangerous' for millions\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nVideo: The KSL Archive: A tornado devastates Salt Lake City\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nThe Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak.

Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot (15.24-centimeter) deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the conversion of a half-foot depth of hail to 15.24 centimeters, not 1.83 meters.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles way from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news",

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak.\n\nFurther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes.\n\nDes Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area.\n\nThe deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people.\n\nThose storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather.\n\nThe total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out.\n\nHurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri":

In the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ...

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference on Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nAlso Read | Heatwave Warning in Pakistan: Schools Shut, Hospitals on Alert As Pakistan Sizzles at 50 Degrees Celsius in Some Areas.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city on Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimise the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow\", Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbours help neighbours, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Centre, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes.\n\nDes Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and cancelled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms on Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 metres deep) hail on Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms on Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised on Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated.

Alex Dinkla. He didn't know the extent of the injuries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said her administration was monitoring the weather situation and maintaing contact with the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. The State Emergency Operations Center was responding to needs in the affected areas, she said in a post on social media.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Powerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through a small Iowa town Tuesday, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nMultiple people were injured in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, said Iowa State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Alex Dinkla. He didn't know the extent of the injuries.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.

Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nTornado damaged property is seen, Wednesday, May 22, 2024, in Greenfield, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\nA firefighter searches through the remains of tornado-damaged property in Greenfield, Iowa. (AP Photo)\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\nPeople walk down a street past damage after a tornado in Greenfield, Iowa. (AP Photo)\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nFirefighters walks among tornado-damaged homes in Greenfield, Iowa. (AP Photo)\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa, leaving a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisting and toppling wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that slammed Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa State Patrol has confirmed multiple deaths from a tornado and at least a dozen injuries in storms Tuesday, but it has not released specific numbers.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said her administration was monitoring the weather situation and maintaing contact with the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. The State Emergency Operations Center was responding to needs in the affected areas, she said in a post on social media.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nPhotos: Northern Lights dance across Montana's Big Sky\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Alex Dinkla.\n\nREAD MORE: Oklahoma town sees second tornado in 5 weeks as deadly storms hit central U.S.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nDamage is seen outside of the Adair County Health System hospital, which was evacuated after a tornado struck the day prior, in Greenfield, Iowa, on May 22, 2024. Photo by Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register/USA Today Network via REUTERS\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Severe storms pummel the Midwest, including reported tornadoes that destroyed homes\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area.

Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and

April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.

He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the US Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce tornado that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines.\n\nThe tornado carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated.\n\nMounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.\n\nResidents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 76-metre wind turbines.\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph.\n\nThey also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimise the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details.\n\nThe hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Centre, among others.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK\n\nAssociated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield and left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees, while outside the small town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds.\n\nAfter devastating the town of 2,000 residents, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield and left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees, while outside the small town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds.\n\nAfter devastating the town of 2,000 residents, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "woodtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt.

The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.

BECK (Associated Press)\n\nAuthorities in Iowa were continuing their search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a tornado slammed the state.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's Office said one woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details of other deaths or injuries.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nAn undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa, leaving a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisting and toppling wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that slammed Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.

The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nSeveral schools in Harvey County face significant storm damage\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the US Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce tornado that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines.\n\nThe tornado carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated.\n\nMounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.\n\nResidents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 76-metre wind turbines.\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph.\n\nThey also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimise the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details.\n\nThe hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Centre, among others.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCCI", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KCCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corning_(city),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corning (city), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corning (city), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Oak,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Oak, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Red Oak, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guthrie County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guthrie County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fontanelle, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fontanelle, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Officials did not release other figures of the dead and wounded.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town of 2,000 people.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, the storms moved east into Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers.\n\nThe U.S. is experiencing a historically bad season for tornadoes as climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the United States.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. This year's preliminary count of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was damaged, which meant that at least a dozen people who were injured had to be taken elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt.

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that the tornado carried from the town.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody. His house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.

BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of the town of 2,000 located around 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Beck, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, May 22, 2024 | 8:10 a.m.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIn Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and had earlier ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines.\n\n\"It's horrific,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday at a news conference just outside the devastated town. \"It's hard to describe.\"\n\nShe and other officials declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris had made it difficult to be sure of those numbers.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that leveled Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nThe deadly tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers , he said, and the damage wrought by it was the worst he had seen since an EF-4 tornado -- with wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph (267 and 320 kph) -- hit Mayfield, Kentucky in December 2021.\n\nA mobile research radar in the area of the Greenfield tornado detected wind speeds higher than 200 mph (320 kph), which is the threshold for an EF-5 tornado, Porter said.\n\n\"But that measurement was taken roughly 600 to 1,000 feet above the ground. It's the severity of damage on the ground documented during storm damage surveys that dictates the strength of a tornado,\" he said.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Tuesday night. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school. The Adair County Health Department reported that a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg.

Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph).

Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area.

Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people.

BECK (Associated Press)\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing their search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a tornado slammed the state.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said one woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details of other deaths or injuries.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa, leaving a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisting and toppling wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that slammed Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before.\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of the town of 2,000 located around 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla said multiple people were injured in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, and there was a lot of damage in town. He didn't know the extent of the injuries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"In far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge of more than 5 inches of rain in less than two hours flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Morrissey Man accused of attempting to hijack plane at La Crosse airport receives four-year commitment Suspicious death in Ettrick under investigation by Trempealeau County Sheriff's Office\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK, Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt.

Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTree crushes pickup truck in Waterloo Man crashes vintage replica hot rod into Waterloo library moments after purchase Deere announces 190 new layoffs in Waterloo after idling 308 workers in April Traer man arrested in 106-mph chase through Waterloo-Cedar Falls My Waterloo Days schedule set for June 6-8 festival, including nationally known musical acts Bicycling child injured after being hit by car at Hudson, Greenhill Roads in Cedar Falls Man now charged with vandalizing mayor's, supervisor's vehicles Walmart lays off hundreds of employees, relocates most remote staff back to primary offices Waterloo man who allegedly left dog in hot car charged with animal's death Two arrested in Friday robbery UPDATED WITH ADDITIONAL ROADS: Black Hawk County announces road closures due to flooding Two people charged with submitting fake lottery tickets, accepting winnings Leadership changes at Bremer County Emergency Management More than 1,600 Waterloo homes without power due to MidAmerican outage Cedar Falls could take next steps to approve Boulder Tap House restaurant\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

The Storm Prediction Center warned of severe weather in Iowa and Wisconsin.Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa and left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars, while the howling winds also twisted and toppled wind turbines. After devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 90 kilometers southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 89 kilometers east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 32 kilometers southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 113 kilometers per hour in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 76-meter wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [],

Alex Dinkla. He didn't know the extent of the injuries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said her administration was monitoring the weather situation and maintaing contact with the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. The State Emergency Operations Center was responding to needs in the affected areas, she said in a post on social media.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa and left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars, while the howling winds also twisted and toppled wind turbines.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nMultiple people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa and left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars, while the howling winds also twisted and toppled wind turbines.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sgt Alex Dinkla, a spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, confirmed multiple casualties and said the tornado devastated a good portion of Greenfield town, although the exact figures of the deceased were not known.\n\nImages from the town of Greenfield show a path of utter destruction, with homes reduced to splinters, debris strewn everywhere and several large wind turbines toppled. At least a dozen people in the Iowa town of 2,000 people, were injured due to the tornado. People had to be transferred to facilities in nearby towns as the local hospital sustained damage in the storm.\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, allowing state resources to be readily utilized in responding to the storm.\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city on Tuesday night. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the grey and overcast sky.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, told KCCI TV in an interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state. At least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire. Several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County. The National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimise the strain.\n\nGreenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbours help neighbours, according to its visitors' page. \"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" Camille Blair said of the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce. \"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma. Another round of storms on Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska, covering Colorado's Yuma city into a blanket of hail.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service. He said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri":

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot (15.24-centimeter) deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the conversion of a half-foot depth of hail to 15.24 centimeters, not 1.83 meters.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Josh Funk in Omaha, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people died Tuesday and at least a dozen were injured when a powerful tornado tore through a small Iowa town, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars, and widely strewn debris.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nHow the feds say they caught one of St. Louis' most prolific cocaine distributors TV Q&A: Where to find the 'Monk' movie Sonny Gray expected the manager to come get him.

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot deep (1.83 meters deep) hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n-- -\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before.\n\nBy HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of the town of 2,000 located around 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of the town of 2,000 located around 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community's small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as \"the friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and \"the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights\" on special holidays. Also touting itself as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nPhotos: Tornado devastates Greenfield as powerful storms sweep through Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK (Associated Press)\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through debris that had been their homes a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people there.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other things that could be salvaged. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it's gone,\" she said. \"Most of it we can't save. But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her home destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road during the storms near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris had made it difficult to be sure of those numbers.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But those findings are preliminary and could change following additional damage assessment over the coming days, the weather service said.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that leveled Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nThe deadly tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), he said, and the damage wrought by it was the worst he had seen since an EF-4 tornado -- with wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph (267 and 320 kph) -- hit Mayfield, Kentucky in December 2021.\n\nA mobile research radar in the area of the Greenfield tornado detected wind speeds higher than 200 mph (320 kph), which is the threshold for an EF-5 tornado, Porter said.\n\n\"But that measurement was taken roughly 600 to 1,000 feet above the ground. It's the severity of damage on the ground documented during storm damage surveys that dictates the strength of a tornado,\" he said.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Tuesday night. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school. The Adair County Health Department reported that a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to to Iowa on Thursday and the White House was in touch with state and local officials.\n\n\"We are praying for those who tragically lost their lives as deadly tornados ripped through Iowa,\" she said. \"We are also wishing a speedy recovery to those who were injured.\"\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nThe tornado tore through houses on the southwest corner of Greenfield and traveled toward the hospital on the east side. Residential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were, by Wednesday, a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and went into the basement when the sirens sounded \"and just kind of huddled in the corner.\" Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nThe family, which has lived in Greenfield for eight years, escaped with minor injuries. Ergish said that as much as she loves the town, she's not sure whether they'll stay.\n\n\"It's kind of traumatizing at the moment,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Earlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg.\n\nWeather service staff also planned to assess storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n___\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nAlso Read | Telstra Layoffs: Australia's Telecommunication Giant To Lay Off 2,800 People To Cut Costs, Deal With Inflation.\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 90 kilometers southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 89 kilometers east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 32 kilometers southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 113 kilometers per hour in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 76-meter wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.

Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield and left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees, while outside the small Iowa town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds.\n\nAfter devastating the town of 2,000 residents on Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Alex Dinkla said multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines.\n\n\"We can confirm there have been fatalities with this tornado,\" said Dinkla, who added that the exact number of weather-related deaths was unclear.\n\n\"At least a dozen\" people were transported to area hospitals with injuries, Dinkla said.\n\n\"We just want to make sure with our search efforts -- obviously this tornado has devastated a good portion of this town and community -- and with that much damage we want to make sure that we're doing our due diligence and making sure we cover that area extensively,\" Dinkla said. \"We have done numerous searches already, but we want to make sure that we search it even better.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nDinkla said a curfew was in place for the city.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph. They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nCBS News obtained dramatic video captured by a tornado chaser in Adams County, Iowa, which showed a home being destroyed by a tornado, with debris swirling.\n\nAs of late Tuesday night, more than 34,000 homes and businesses in Iowa were without power, according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us, along with more than 142,000 in Wisconsin and 24,000 in Illinois.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area.\n\nMore than 10,000 customers lost power in and around Omaha early Tuesday, and the deluge of more than 5 inches of rain in less than two hours in some areas saw basements flooded and cars submerged in low-lying areas. That downpour, combined with rain earlier in the nighttime hours, brought the total to 8 inches in the region, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTelevision station KETV showed video of several vehicles overtaken by rushing water on a low-lying street in north-central Omaha and firefighters arriving to rescue people inside.\n\nWhile officials had not confirmed tornadoes in the area, there were confirmed reports of hurricane-force winds, said weather service meteorologist Becky Kern.\n\n\"We have a 90 mph gust measured at Columbus,\" Kern said. Columbus is about 87 miles west of Omaha.\n\nChris Bruin, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, said the storms were likely to intensify as the night went on and produce \"more destructive tornadoes.\"\n\nTornado watches were also in place south to Missouri and Arkansas, but Bruin forecasted that Iowa would likely see the \"bulk of the worst conditions.\"\n\nParts of Illinois and Minnesota were also under threat of severe weather, with conditions also expected to worsen Tuesday night. The Chicago metropolitan area could see wind gusts up to 75 mph, with possible tornado activity, according to CBS Chicago meteorologists David Yeomans and Albert Ramon.\n\nA dust storm near Bloomington in central Illinois forced Illinois State Police to shut down portions of Interstate 55 and Interstate 74 earlier Tuesday, CBS Chicago reported. Anyone caught in the storm was advised to pull over and turn off their lights.\n\nThe weather service also issued tornado warnings for portions of southern Minnesota. CBS Minnesota meteorologist Joseph Dames forecasted that Eastern Minnesota -- including the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.\n\nThe storms follow days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Residents cleaned up Tuesday using heavy construction equipment and snow shovels to clear ice that had piled up knee-deep.\n\nThe storm in Yuma shattered vehicle windshields, pounded the siding off buildings and broke many windows. lt also brought heavy rain to the city of about 3,500 people about 40 miles west of Nebraska, stranding some cars in the streets. The hail was still about a half-foot deep on Tuesday morning and front-end loaders were used to move it, said Curtis Glenn, a trustee at Yuma Methodist Church, which had flooding and hail damage.\n\nGlenn, an insurance claims adjuster, said the combined sounds of the hail, rain and wind sounded like \"a gun going off while you're on a train.\"\n\n\"It's not something you ever want to see or ever want to see again,\" he said of the storm, the worst he has seen in his years working in the insurance industry.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least seven. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"},

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through debris that had been their homes a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people there.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other things that could be salvaged. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n\"Most of it's gone,\" she said. \"Most of it we can't save. But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her home destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road during the storms near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris had made it difficult to be sure of those numbers.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But those findings are preliminary and could change following additional damage assessment over the coming days, the weather service said.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that leveled Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nThe deadly tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), he said, and the damage wrought by it was the worst he had seen since an EF-4 tornado -- with wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph (267 and 320 kph) -- hit Mayfield, Kentucky in December 2021.\n\nA mobile research radar in the area of the Greenfield tornado detected wind speeds higher than 200 mph (320 kph), which is the threshold for an EF-5 tornado, Porter said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"But that measurement was taken roughly 600 to 1,000 feet above the ground. It's the severity of damage on the ground documented during storm damage surveys that dictates the strength of a tornado,\" he said.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Tuesday night. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school. The Adair County Health Department reported that a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to to Iowa on Thursday and the White House was in touch with state and local officials.\n\n\"We are praying for those who tragically lost their lives as deadly tornados ripped through Iowa,\" she said. \"We are also wishing a speedy recovery to those who were injured.\"\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nThe tornado tore through houses on the southwest corner of Greenfield and traveled toward the hospital on the east side. Residential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were, by Wednesday, a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and went into the basement when the sirens sounded \"and just kind of huddled in the corner.\" Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nThe family, which has lived in Greenfield for eight years, escaped with minor injuries. Ergish said that as much as she loves the town, she's not sure whether they'll stay.\n\n\"It's kind of traumatizing at the moment,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Earlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg.\n\nWeather service staff also planned to assess storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield and left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees, while outside the small town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds.\n\nAfter devastating the town of 2,000 residents, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nHow the feds say they caught one of St. Louis' most prolific cocaine distributors TV Q&A: Where to find the 'Monk' movie Cardinals 'City Connect' uniforms: All you need to know, from new details to Nelly's role MLB's latest broadcast move yet again aggravates some Cardinals fans: Media Views Sultan: Why aren't more of us snacking on cicadas?

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

He said authorities were still determining the total number.\n\nPowerful storms that rolled through the US Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce tornado that smashed through the small Iowa town of Greenfield, with a population of about 2,000 around 55 miles southwest of Des Moines.\n\nThe tornado carved a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, shredded trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris.\n\nMounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.\n\nResidents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 76-metre wind turbines.\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the US Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph.\n\nThey also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimise the strain.\n\nThe hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Centre, among others.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city of Madison.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCCI", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KCCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corning_(city),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corning (city), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corning (city), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Oak,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Oak, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Red Oak, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guthrie County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guthrie County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fontanelle, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fontanelle, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Img38093094.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before.\n\nBy HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nPhotos: Tornado devastates Greenfield as powerful storms sweep through Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through debris that had been their homes a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people there.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other things that could be salvaged. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it's gone,\" she said. \"Most of it we can't save. But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her home destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road during the storms near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris had made it difficult to be sure of those numbers.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But those findings are preliminary and could show a more powerful tornado following additional damage assessment over the coming days, the weather service said.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that leveled Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), he said, and the damage wrought by it was the worst he had seen since an EF-4 tornado -- with wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph (267 and 320 kph) -- hit Mayfield, Kentucky in December 2021.\n\nA mobile research radar in the area of the Greenfield tornado detected wind speeds higher than 200 mph (320 kph), which is the threshold for an EF-5 tornado, Porter said.\n\n\"But that measurement was taken roughly 600 to 1,000 feet above the ground. It's the severity of damage on the ground documented during storm damage surveys that dictates the strength of a tornado,\" he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, and at least a dozen people who were hurt were taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials.\n\n\"We are praying for those who tragically lost their lives as deadly tornados ripped through Iowa,\" she said. \"We are also wishing a speedy recovery to those who were injured.\"\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nThe tornado tore through houses on the southwest corner of Greenfield and traveled toward the hospital on the east side. Residential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were, by Wednesday, a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and went into the basement when the sirens sounded \"and just kind of huddled in the corner.\" Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from his home in suburban Des Moines back to his hometown of Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother whose home was destroyed. She took refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door to the room \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nThe tornado directly hit and collapsed six MidAmerican Energy wind turbines, the utility said. Several of the turbines' sensors registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Power outages affecting 2,000 people or more were also reported in Lake and DuPage Counties, according to the map.\n\nWest of Rockford, in Stephenson County, more than 3,000 ComEd customers were without power, the map showed.\n\nIn several suburbs including Niles and Bartlett, downed powerlines were causing road closures, as well as delays and transit isues on the CTA Yellow Line and Metra Milwaukee North Line.\n\nIn Elgin, NBC 5 reported Lisa Chavarria reported downed trees and smashed car windows due to flying debris overnight.\n\n\"We continue to track the severe storms with strong wind gusts in our area,\" a statement posted to ComEd's website read. \"We will provide updated information as often as possible. Our crews are in the field ready to make repairs and restore power as needed.\"\n\nAccording to the NBC 5 Storm Team, Wednesday and Thursday were expected to remain mild dry in the Chicago area, with storms and shows returning Friday morning and late afternoon and continuing through the evening hours.\n\nShowers and storms were also in the forecast Sunday, NBC 5 Meteorologist Alicia Roman said.\n\nIn Iowa, the severe weather outbreak was deadly for some parts, and crews from the National Weather Service were expected to survey at least three areas to survey damage and officially determine how many tornadoes touched down.\n\nMultiple people were killed when a tornado tore through Greenfield and left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees, while outside the small Iowa town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds.\n\nAfter devastating the town of 2,000 residents on Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before.\n\nBy HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nQuad-Cities business openings, closings: Wolfe It Down, Azteca 3 and more 'Worst decision they ever made;' Residents hit hard by Hy-Vee's plan to close Rockingham Road store Meta named as company considering Davenport for data center; state board OKs incentives Man receives life-threatening injuries in officer-involved shooting in East Moline Friday; task force investigating Former Davenport mayor, council member push back against Spiegel's allegations Fired employee sues Scott County, alleging retaliation for complaints against sheriff, wife Azteca 3 in Bettendorf to shutter its doors this year Five men involved in shootings during Davenport riots in 2020 convicted of racketeering Deere announces 190 new layoffs in Waterloo after idling 308 workers in April Orion School Board hears complaints of book being removed from curriculum Davenport man arrested for May 5 Moline double homicide Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signs bill capping THC product potency, despite concerns Davenport man Brian Goodwin opened his home to his alleged killers Davenport West's Thomas wins school's first state track title since 1995 Quad City Bank & Trust CEO John Anderson to retire\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of the town of 2,000 located around 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Residents helped one another salvage furniture and other belongings from debris or homes barely left standing.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames.\n\nThe Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield was damaged in the storm, but Mercy One spokesman Todd Mizener said he had no further details. The hospital is affiliated with Mercy One, and officials were on their way to Greenfield to assess the damage.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed about 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she said. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state's capital city, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph and 45 mph hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n\"There is no visibility at times,\" state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nStorms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot-deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. The storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday's storms were expected to bring high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

Strong storms will strike across central Texas and all the way to upstate New York this week, forecasters have warned. The threat of severe weather is greatest in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nWind damage and hail, possibly golf ball sized or larger, are the primary concerns, but Weather Channel meteorologists warn a few tornados are expected. Northern Texas, southeast Oklahoma, northern and central Arkansas, southern Missouri and western Tennessee are most likely to by hit by twisters. The threat of severe storms comes just one day after multiple people were killed and at least a dozen injured when a tornado tore through a small Iowa town and left behind a swarth of destruction.\n\nParts of the Midwest, as well as regions in the south and east, could also see scattered, severe thunderstorms from Friday and throughout the Memorial Day weekend. A tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, Iowa on Tuesday, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The storm left a wide swath of obliterated homes, crumpled cars and splintered trees on Tuesday, while outside the small town, massive wind turbines were buckled and twisted to the ground by the howling winds. After devastating the town of 2,000 residents, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to more than 130,000 customers in the two states.\n\nEntire neighborhoods were flattened by several deadly twisters that gripped the region on Tuesday evening, with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds placing 15 counties under disaster emergency proclamations. Iowa Police confirmed there have been multiple fatalities in the deadly weather front. One death occurred in Adams County, Iowa, around 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, when a woman was ejected from a vehicle during the brutal storm. Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla. 'Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,' Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. 'We're still counting at this time.'\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there. Footage showed widespread damage hours after the tornadoes tore through rural Iowa, including entire trees being shredded from their roots. The small town of Greenfield, around 40 miles from the death in Adams County, was among the hardest hit, and a tornado that developed around 5pm leveled hundreds of homes and left several people injured, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla said.\n\nAt a press conference, Dinkla estimated that over a dozen people were hospitalized, but could not offer an exact number. He added that all known residents were accounted for, but searches were still ongoing through the wreckage. Images shared to Facebook by a Greenfield resident saw entire homes reduced to rubble and turned into scattered debris, while brick walls were flattened by the force of the twister. A local hospital was hit by the fierce tornadoes, forcing staff and patients to evacuate the ransacked buildings and set up field hospitals at nearby high schools. Massive wind turbines were also destroyed by the gusts, with at least three turbines destroyed in Adams County, and MidAmerican Energy Company said it owned several more that were destroyed in Adair County.\n\nWhile aiding injured residents, the Adair County Memorial Hospital also 'sustained tornado damage', officials said, that forced it to transfer patients to other nearby medical centers. Greenfield instated a mandatory curfew from 10pm to 7am as the aftermath is surveyed, however officials said the true extent of the devastation may not be clear until daybreak. Heavy cleanup crews have been spotted across the state, with unaffected counties including Guthrie and Madison reportedly enlisted to help clear damage in Greenfield. Early reports said multiple tornadoes were also reported in Montgomery County, and Meteorologists warned that the storm system across the Midwest may generate several more catastrophic-strength tornadoes.\n\nIn total across the Midwest, over 25 million people were under at least a Level 3 severe thunderstorm warnings on Tuesday evening. It comes after a period of intense storms through the nation's heartland in recent days, including three minor tornadoes registered Monday in Minnesota, Nebraska and Colorado. Although much of the early damage was contained to rural Iowa, officials warned that several large cities and population centers could find themselves in the storm's path. Chicago and Milwaukee are both at risk of being hit by destructive storms, and Des Moines International Airport closed its runways in anticipation of tornadoes potentially landing late Tuesday. Multiple regions have also seen flash flooding due to the storms, with heavy rainfall warnings instated across the Midwest.\n\nThrough Tuesday night, the Storm Prediction Center launched a rare 'potentially dangerous situation' tornado watch spanning Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. The tornado watch is only used when experts believe there is a high chance for multiple, long-lasting tornadoes registering at EF2 or stronger, meaning speeds of at least 111mph. Residents in Greenfield described witnessing the devastation across their town, with Valerie Warrior telling KCCI she was our riding her bike when the storm descended. 'There's houses down all over the place,' Warrior said, noting that she raced to her basement to wait out the tornado before emerging to find the town covered in debris. 'Devastating,' she added.\n\nStunning images from storm chaser Nahel Belgherze focused on the damage seen in one Greenfield street, as a sleepy suburb was turned into rubble within hours. Resident Donnell Griffith said despite the carnage, the small town of roughly 2,000 people will recover from the storms. 'We're a small community, we're a tough community... we will rebuild this community together,' she said. 'We're small but we're mighty.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Residents in the small city in northeastern Colorado were cleaning up Tuesday after hail the size of baseballs and golf balls pounded the community, with heavy construction equipment and snow shovels being used to clear hail that had piled up knee-deep the night before.\n\nBy HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish, 33, and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys indicated at least an EF-3 tornado in Greenfield, but additional damage assessment could lead to a more powerful ranking.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home gone, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapsed, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Officials said multiple people were killed Tuesday when a tornado ripped through a small town in Iowa, decimating homes and damaging businesses.\n\nThe town of Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings damaged -- which meant that at least a dozen people hurt had to be taken to hospitals elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Kim Reynolds speaks with a worker at a command station after touring tornado damage, Wednesday, May 22, 2024, in Greenfield, Iowa.\n\nBy HANNAH FINGERHUT and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through debris that had been their homes a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people there.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other things that could be salvaged. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her home destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road during the storms near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris had made it difficult to be sure of those numbers.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But those findings are preliminary and could change following additional damage assessment over the coming days, the weather service said.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that leveled Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nThe deadly tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), he said, and the damage wrought by it was the worst he had seen since an EF-4 tornado -- with wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph (267 and 320 kph) -- hit Mayfield, Kentucky in December 2021.\n\nA mobile research radar in the area of the Greenfield tornado detected wind speeds higher than 200 mph (320 kph), which is the threshold for an EF-5 tornado, Porter said.\n\n\"But that measurement was taken roughly 600 to 1,000 feet above the ground. It's the severity of damage on the ground documented during storm damage surveys that dictates the strength of a tornado,\" he said.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Tuesday night. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school. The Adair County Health Department reported that a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to to Iowa on Thursday and the White House was in touch with state and local officials.\n\n\"We are praying for those who tragically lost their lives as deadly tornados ripped through Iowa,\" she said. \"We are also wishing a speedy recovery to those who were injured.\"\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nThe tornado tore through houses on the southwest corner of Greenfield and traveled toward the hospital on the east side. Residential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were, by Wednesday, a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and went into the basement when the sirens sounded \"and just kind of huddled in the corner.\" Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nThe family, which has lived in Greenfield for eight years, escaped with minor injuries. Ergish said that as much as she loves the town, she's not sure whether they'll stay.\n\n\"It's kind of traumatizing at the moment,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Earlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg.\n\nWeather service staff also planned to assess storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, devastating the town of Greenfield and killing an undisclosed number of people there.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road during the storms near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIn Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and had earlier ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines.\n\n\"It's horrific,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday at a news conference just outside the devastated town. \"It's hard to describe.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that leveled Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nThe deadly tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers , he said, and the damage wrought by it was the worst he had seen since an EF-4 tornado -- with wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph (267 and 320 kph) -- hit Mayfield, Kentucky in December 2021.\n\nA mobile research radar in the area of the Greenfield tornado detected wind speeds higher than 200 mph (320 kph), which is the threshold for an EF-5 tornado, Porter said.\n\n\"But that measurement was taken roughly 600 to 1,000 feet above the ground. It's the severity of damage on the ground documented during storm damage surveys that dictates the strength of a tornado,\" he said.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Tuesday night. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school. The Adair County Health Department reported that a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Greenfield tornado, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Earlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis; Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska; Colleen Slevin in Denver and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nPeople are also reading...

April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Josh Funk in Omaha, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nPhotos: Tornado devastates Greenfield as powerful storms sweep through Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of the town of 2,000 located around 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for the town and said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (89 kph). They also lock and feather their blades and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nGreenfield bills itself on its website as a \"friendly wave as you walk\" type of place with tree-lined streets -- before the storm -- and as the \"perfect place to grow.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIn southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Farther east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIowa was braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled evening activities.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the capital, Madison.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of up to 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines and Beck reported from Omaha.

Homes and businesses were flattened and destroyed, trees shredded and cars smashed.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" confirmed Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla during a press briefing on Tuesday night. While the exact number of deaths is still being ascertained, officials believe they have accounted for all residents.\n\nREAD MORE: Floods leave 7 dead as severe thunderstorms bring terrifying 'derecho storm' to Texas\n\nThe tornado wreaked havoc in Greenfield, causing extensive damage including at the local hospital, where patients were forced to evacuate and seek medical attention in neighbouring cities. Authorities have imposed strict access restrictions on Greenfield, only allowing residents to enter until Wednesday morning and instructing media to vacate the city by Tuesday night. The storm's aftermath has left parts of Greenfield in ruins, with debris from homes, trees, and vehicles scattered across the landscape.\n\nAmidst the wreckage, community members are coming together to help one another recover belongings and secure what remains of their homes. Rogue Paxton recounted his experience to WOI-TV, taking refuge in his basement as the storm passed, initially fearing his house was destroyed. \"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton shared.\n\nHe observed the solidarity among residents, saying: \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nThe state suffered multiple tornadoes, with one even toppling several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa, some of which caught fire and continued to burn for hours. Wind farms are engineered to endure tornadoes, hurricanes and other intense winds. The US Department of Energy states that turbines are programmed to shut down when wind speeds surpass certain limits, usually around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also secure and feather their blades, and align with the wind, to reduce stress.\n\nGreenfield is a town that prides itself on its friendly atmosphere, with tree-lined streets - prior to the storm - and special holiday celebrations marked by fireworks or twinkling lights. It's also known as the \"perfect place to grow,\" where business owners recognise you and neighbours assist each other, according to its visitor's page.\n\nMary Long, who owns Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, weathered the storm at her business located in the community's historic town square, which was largely unscathed. She reported extensive damage on the east and south sides of town. \"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she recounted.\n\nFor all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US\n\nCamille Blair, who works at the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office, said the office closed around 2pm before the storm hit. After the storm, she emerged from her home to witness widespread destruction and debris scattered everywhere.\n\n\"There's a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,\" she observed. \"And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.\"\n\nIn the far southwest of Iowa, a tornado was captured on video just northwest of Red Oak.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Morrissey Suspicious death in Ettrick under investigation by Trempealeau County Sheriff's Office Onalaska man arrested for drug overdose death in Jackson County WIAA Division 1 track and field regionals: Holmen advances in 32 events\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But additional damage assessment could show a more powerful tornado.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away from Greenfield, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and huddled in a corner of her basement when the sirens sounded. Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home destroyed, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapses, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK, Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nHow the feds say they caught one of St. Louis' most prolific cocaine distributors TV Q&A: Where to find the 'Monk' movie Cardinals 'City Connect' uniforms: All you need to know, from new details to Nelly's role MLB's latest broadcast move yet again aggravates some Cardinals fans: Media Views Sultan: Why aren't more of us snacking on cicadas?

How a small gesture revealed ace Sonny Gray's big faith in Cardinals bullpen and manager Sonny Gray expected the manager to come get him. Oliver Marmol sent a different message.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar-confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

BECK (Associated Press)\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Crews moved methodically Wednesday through a small Iowa town devastated by a powerful tornado, searching through mounds of debris to be sure no victims remained buried in the rubble, but authorities would not say how many were killed or injured in the storm.\n\nThe tornado Tuesday afternoon left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\n\"It's still a search mission as far as we're looking to be sure all residents are accounted for,\" said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish, 33, and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, neither Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds nor other officials would give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said initial surveys indicated at least an EF-3 tornado in Greenfield, but additional damage assessment could lead to a more powerful ranking.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nThe deadly twister was spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home gone, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\n___\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nMan crashes vintage replica hot rod into Waterloo library moments after purchase Tree crushes pickup truck in Waterloo UPDATED WITH ADDITIONAL ROADS: Black Hawk County announces road closures due to flooding Deere announces 190 new layoffs in Waterloo after idling 308 workers in April Traer man arrested in 106-mph chase through Waterloo-Cedar Falls My Waterloo Days schedule set for June 6-8 festival, including nationally known musical acts Bicycling child injured after being hit by car at Hudson, Greenhill Roads in Cedar Falls Man now charged with vandalizing mayor's, supervisor's vehicles Waterloo man who allegedly left dog in hot car charged with animal's death Two arrested in Friday robbery More than 1,600 Waterloo homes without power due to MidAmerican outage Two people charged with submitting fake lottery tickets, accepting winnings Leadership changes at Bremer County Emergency Management MasterBrand will acquire Bertch parent company Supreme Cabinetry Brands Cedar Falls could take next steps to approve Boulder Tap House restaurant\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Local 5 has yet to confirm how many fatalities occurred as a result of the storms, nor the identities of the deceased.\n\n\"The Greenfield community has a long road ahead of them. But if their actions today are any indication of what lies ahead, they will emerge stronger and more more united than ever,\" Dinkla said.\n\nA curfew was in place for the town of Greenfield beginning at 10 p.m. Tuesday and going until 7 a.m. on Wednesday. Dinkla noted the curfew is expected to continue \"for quite some time\".\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds is expected to be in Greenfield 10 a.m. Wednesday to \"begin the recovery process\", according to a press release. Congressman Zach Nunn will also be in town to assess the damage.\n\n\"Iowans are resilient - and we will get through this together,\" Nunn said on X.\n\nIf you are unable to contact a loved one in Greenfield, call the Iowa Department of Public Safety Storm Lake Communication Center at 712-732-1341.

Entire neighborhoods were flattened by several deadly twisters that gripped the region on Tuesday evening, with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds placing 15 counties under disaster emergency proclamations.\n\nHours after a tornado touched down in Greenfield, aerial footage showed where a tornado tore through the town as homes were leveled and trees were shredded down to their stumps. Carnage is expected to continue through the Midwest as a storm system develops - with over 25 million people currently under severe weather warnings, stretching from Missouri to Wisconsin.\n\nIowa Police confirmed there have been multiple fatalities in the deadly weather front. One death occurred in Adams County, Iowa, around 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, when a woman was ejected from a vehicle during the brutal storm. Footage showed widespread damage hours after the tornadoes tore through rural Iowa, including entire trees being shredded from their roots.\n\nThe small town of Greenfield, around 40 miles from the death in Adams County, was among the hardest hit, and a tornado that developed around 5pm leveled hundreds of homes and left several people injured, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla said. At a press conference, Dinkla estimated that over a dozen people were hospitalized, but could not offer an exact number. He added that all known residents were accounted for, but searches were still ongoing through the wreckage.\n\nImages shared to Facebook by a Greenfield resident saw entire homes reduced to rubble and turned into scattered debris, while brick walls were flattened by the force of the twister. A local hospital was hit by the fierce tornadoes, forcing staff and patients to evacuate the ransacked buildings and set up field hospitals at nearby high schools.\n\nMassive wind turbines were also destroyed by the gusts, with at least three turbines destroyed in Adams County, and MidAmerican Energy Company said it owned several more that were destroyed in Adair County. While aiding injured residents, the Adair County Memorial Hospital also 'sustained tornado damage', officials said, that forced it to transfer patients to other nearby medical centers. Greenfield instated a mandatory curfew from 10pm to 7am as the aftermath is surveyed, however officials said the true extent of the devastation may not be clear until daybreak.\n\nHeavy cleanup crews have been spotted across the state, with unaffected counties including Guthrie and Madison reportedly enlisted to help clear damage in Greenfield. Early reports said multiple tornadoes were also reported in Montgomery County, and Meteorologists warned that the storm system across the Midwest may generate several more catastrophic-strength tornadoes. In total across the Midwest, over 25 million people were under at least a Level 3 severe thunderstorm warnings on Tuesday evening.\n\nIt comes after a period of intense storms through the nation's heartland in recent days, including three minor tornadoes registered Monday in Minnesota, Nebraska and Colorado. Although much of the early damage was contained to rural Iowa, officials warned that several large cities and population centers could find themselves in the storm's path. Chicago and Milwaukee are both at risk of being hit by destructive storms, and Des Moines International Airport closed its runways in anticipation of tornadoes potentially landing late Tuesday.\n\nMultiple regions have also seen flash flooding due to the storms, with heavy rainfall warnings instated across the Midwest. Through Tuesday night, the Storm Prediction Center launched a rare 'potentially dangerous situation' tornado watch spanning Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. The tornado watch is only used when experts believe there is a high chance for multiple, long-lasting tornadoes registering at EF2 or stronger, meaning speeds of at least 111mph.\n\nResidents in Greenfield described witnessing the devastation across their town, with Valerie Warrior telling KCCI she was our riding her bike when the storm descended. 'There's houses down all over the place,' Warrior said, noting that she raced to her basement to wait out the tornado before emerging to find the town covered in debris. 'Devastating,' she added.\n\nStunning images from storm chaser Nahel Belgherze focused on the damage seen in one Greenfield street, as a sleepy suburb was turned into rubble within hours. Resident Donnell Griffith said despite the carnage, the small town of roughly 2,000 people will recover from the storms. 'We're a small community, we're a tough community... we will rebuild this community together,' she said. 'We're small but we're mighty.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

BECK, Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nPhotos: Tornado devastates Greenfield as powerful storms sweep through Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Search and rescue operations were continuing overnight.\n\n-- Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa issued an emergency disaster proclamation in 15 counties. In Adams County, one woman died from storm-related causes, according to the county's medical examiner.\n\n-- At least 110,000 customers were without power in Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana as of 5 a.m. local time, according to Poweroutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.\n\n-- The National Weather Service warned of \"unsettled and changeable weather\" from the West Coast to the Great Plains in the next few days. On Wednesday, a wide swath of the United States was at risk of severe weather, from Texas to New York state. Storms with large hail, damaging winds and potentially tornadoes were likely across parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.\n\nThe storm devastated Greenfield, a city of about 2,000 people, where video footage showed destroyed homes, mangled cars, and roads covered with debris after a reported tornado swept through the town in the afternoon. The Adair County Health System hospital in the city sustained tornado damage, and patients were transferred to other nearby hospitals, the Iowa Department of Public Safety said in a statement.\n\nThe city announced a curfew from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. as it assessed the death toll and damage. \"This tornado has devastated a good portion of this town and community,\" Sgt. Alex Dinkla of the Iowa State Patrol said at a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\nIn Adams County, near Greenfield, television footage showed that three wind turbines had been toppled. One appeared to have caught fire, releasing a large plume of smoke.\n\nA flood warning was in place for Butler and Black Hawk counties, northeast of Des Moines, for much of Wednesday.\n\nThe storms began Tuesday morning with pea-sized hail, strong winds and heavy rains sweeping through Madison County, southwest of Des Moines. Multiple tornadoes were reported in southwest Iowa, as well as several north of Des Moines. At one point Tuesday night, more than 13 million people in parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were under tornado watches.\n\nIt was the latest bout of severe weather to strike the Midwest in recent weeks. Earlier storms have killed dozens of people across multiple states and injured many more. There have been more than 150 preliminary reports of tornadoes in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri so far this year. Most of those reports occurred before May and June, typically the peak period for tornadic weather in these states.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Beck | Associated Press\n\nBy HANNAH FINGERHUT and MARGERY A. BECK (Associated Press)\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through the debris strewn on the land where their homes had stood a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But additional damage assessment could show a more powerful tornado.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away from Greenfield, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and huddled in a corner of her basement when the sirens sounded. Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home destroyed, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapses, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\n___\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Kim Reynolds nor other officials would give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said initial surveys indicated at least an EF-3 tornado in Greenfield, but additional damage assessment could lead to a more powerful ranking.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nThe deadly twister was spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home gone, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Significant destruction was observed, with homes and turbines damaged. Governor Reynolds has declared a disaster emergency for 15 counties, mobilizing state resources for recovery. Local hospitals were overwhelmed, requiring patient transfers to nearby towns.\n\nA powerful tornado ripped through a small Iowa town on Tuesday, killing multiple people and leaving at least a dozen injured, authorities said. Images from the town of Greenfield show a path of utter destruction, with homes reduced to splinters, debris strewn everywhere and several large wind turbines toppled.\n\n\"This tornado has devastated a good portion of this town,\" said Sgt. Alex Dinkla, a spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, during an evening press conference in Greenfield. \"We can confirm there have been multiple fatalities with this tornado.\"\n\nDinkla did not provide a death toll, but said it may not be before Wednesday that figures could be provided. At least a dozen people in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 people, were injured in the twister, Dinkla said. Because the local hospital sustained damage in the storm, those people had to be transferred to facilities in nearby towns.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds said she would visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning. \"While it's too soon to know the storm's full impact, answers will come in the hours and days ahead,\" Reynolds said in a statement.\n\nThe governor said the state would provide its full resources to help the impacted areas recover, and reassured residents that support was in place working to provide shelter, food and water, and restore power to thousands of residents. \"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, told CBS affiliate KCCI TV in an interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state. At least one person, a woman in Adams County, was listed as a storm-related fatality, the county's medical examiner Lisa Brown said. She spoke to Reuters by phone but said she could not yet provide more details.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, including Adair and Adams, allowing state resources to be readily utilized in responding to the storm. Also in Adams County, at least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire, KCCI reported. It said several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Earlier in the day, the weather service confirmed at least one tornado over Rollingstone, Minnesota.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCCI", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KCCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_seat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County seat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollingstone,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rollingstone, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rollingstone, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_25_34_3607277.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

BECK, Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK, Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa after a massive tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nPeople are also reading...

April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Josh Funk in Omaha, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Search and rescue operations were continuing overnight.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa issued an emergency disaster proclamation in 15 counties. In Adams County, one woman died from storm-related causes, according to the county's medical examiner.\n\nAt least 110,000 customers were without power in Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana as of 5 a.m. local time, according to Poweroutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"unsettled and changeable weather\" from the West Coast to the Great Plains in the next few days. On Wednesday, a wide swath of the United States was at risk of severe weather, from Texas to New York State. Storms with large hail, damaging winds and potentially tornadoes were likely across parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.\n\nThe storm devastated Greenfield, a city of about 2,000 people, where video footage showed destroyed homes, mangled cars, and roads covered with debris after a reported tornado swept through the town in the afternoon. The Adair County Health System hospital in the city sustained tornado damage, and patients were transferred to other nearby hospitals, the Iowa Department of Public Safety said in a statement.\n\nThe city announced a curfew from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. local time as it assessed the death toll and damage. \"This tornado has devastated a good portion of this town and community,\" Sgt. Alex Dinkla of the Iowa State Patrol said at a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\nIn Adams County, near Greenfield, television footage showed that three wind turbines had been toppled. One appeared to have caught fire, releasing a large plume of smoke.\n\nA flood warning was in place for Butler and Black Hawk counties, northeast of Des Moines, for much of Wednesday.\n\nThe storms began on Tuesday morning with pea-sized hail, strong winds and heavy rains sweeping through Madison County, southwest of Des Moines. Multiple tornadoes were reported in southwest Iowa, as well as several north of Des Moines. At one point on Tuesday night, more than 13 million people in parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were under tornado watches.\n\nIt was the latest bout of severe weather to strike the Midwest in recent weeks. Earlier storms have killed dozens of people across multiple states and injured many more. There have been more than 150 preliminary reports of tornadoes in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri so far this year. Most of those reports occurred before May and June, typically the peak period for tornadic weather in these states.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

BECK - Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa were continuing search and rescue efforts Wednesday, a day after a deadly tornado slammed the state, killing at least one.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's office said a woman died Tuesday when her vehicle was blown off the road during the storms about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of Corning, Iowa, or about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, where the tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars.\n\nThe woman's name and age were not immediately released. She was the only occupant in the vehicle.\n\nOfficials did not immediately give details Wednesday morning of other deaths or injuries, saying they were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nThe tornado that tore through Greenfield also twisted and toppled wind turbines outside of the small town.\n\nHow the feds say they caught one of St. Louis' most prolific cocaine distributors TV Q&A: Where to find the 'Monk' movie Cardinals 'City Connect' uniforms: All you need to know, from new details to Nelly's role MLB's latest broadcast move yet again aggravates some Cardinals fans: Media Views Sultan: Why aren't more of us snacking on cicadas?

How a small gesture revealed ace Sonny Gray's big faith in Cardinals bullpen and manager Firm that accused ex-Mercy executive of bribery and extortion sues the health system\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that hit Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Josh Funk in Omaha, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The destructive force of nature carved a grim scene of devastation, reducing homes and businesses to rubble, tearing through trees, and scattering debris far and wide.\n\nGreenfield, a community of approximately 2,000 residents situated roughly 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, bore the brunt of the tornado's wrath. This calamity unfolded amidst a day marked by multiple tornadoes, colossal hailstones, and torrential downpours across several states.\n\n\"We do have confirmed fatalities,\" Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night.\n\nAuthorities are still working to determine the total number of casualties, but they believe they've now located all of the town's residents. Sadly, there have been at least a dozen injuries reported amidst the widespread devastation in Greenfield, including damage to the community's small hospital, necessitating the transfer of patients to nearby cities.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the Adair County Health System swiftly established a triage center at Greenfield High School, urging those in need of medical assistance to seek aid there.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, authorities have restricted access to Greenfield, permitting only residents to enter until Wednesday morning, and instructing media representatives to depart the city by Tuesday night.\n\nThe aftermath of the storm has left parts of Greenfield in ruins. Streets are strewn with mounds of debris -- broken wood, branches, and car parts -- marking the spots where homes once stood. Amidst the wreckage, damaged vehicles lie twisted, while houses sit askew against the somber backdrop of the overcast sky. Barely recognizable, trees stand stripped of their branches and leaves. Despite the devastation, residents are coming together, assisting one another in salvaging what they can from the debris or from homes that remain precariously standing.\n\nReflecting on the ordeal, Rogue Paxton recounted sheltering in the basement of his home as the storm raged through. While fearing the worst for his house, he expressed gratitude that his family emerged from the ordeal relatively unscathed.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nAcross the state, reports of multiple tornadoes emerged, with one notably causing damage to several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of these turbines were even engulfed in flames, releasing plumes of smoke that lingered for hours.\n\nTypically designed to withstand the forces of nature, wind farms like these are engineered to endure tornadoes, hurricanes, and strong winds. Equipped with safety measures, such as automatic shutdowns when wind speeds exceed certain thresholds -- usually around 55 mph -- and blade-locking mechanisms, turbines are built to minimize damage by turning into the wind and feathering their blades.\n\nBefore the storm, Greenfield was celebrated as a welcoming community, boasting tree-lined streets that invited a friendly wave from passersby. Special occasions were marked by the crackle of fireworks and the twinkle of lights, creating a festive atmosphere. Branded as the \"perfect place to grow,\" Greenfield prides itself on its tight-knit community spirit, where local businesses know their patrons by name and neighbors readily lend a helping hand.\n\nMary Long, owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, recounted sheltering from the storm at her business located in the town's historic square, which fortunately escaped significant damage. However, Long observed widespread devastation on the east and south sides of town, highlighting the storm's impact on various parts of the community.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she told AP news.\n\nIn the far southwestern reaches of Iowa, social media footage captured the ominous sight of a tornado looming just northwest of Red Oak. As the storm system progressed eastward and northward, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for regions near towns like Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle, and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nThe state of Iowa had been on high alert for severe weather following forecasts from the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, which had indicated a significant risk of severe thunderstorms capable of producing strong tornadoes across most of the state. In anticipation of the impending storms, Des Moines public schools took precautionary measures by dismissing classes two hours early and canceling all evening activities.\n\nAs the storms and tornado warnings swept across the region, they eventually reached Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and into the night. Among the areas affected was the state's capital city of Madison, which also found itself under a tornado warning, heightening concerns for residents and authorities alike.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents of Omaha, Nebraska, were jolted awake by blaring weather sirens and faced widespread power outages as the area was battered by torrential rain, high winds, and large hail. The relentless downpour led to flooded basements and submerged cars, prompting dramatic rescue efforts by firefighters who braved the elements to assist stranded motorists, as captured by television station KETV.\n\nMeanwhile, in Illinois, dust storms prompted authorities to close sections of two interstates due to dangerously low visibility. According to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer, wind gusts ranging from 35 mph to 45 mph wreaked havoc in the McLean area.\n\nThese storms were part of a series of extreme weather events that have swept across the central United States in recent days. Oklahoma and Kansas were rocked by strong winds, large hail, and tornadoes on Sunday, resulting in damaged homes and injuries. On Monday night, Colorado and western Nebraska were hit by another round of storms, with the city of Yuma, Colorado, being blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls. The aftermath saw streets transformed into icy rivers, with front-end loaders needed to clear hail as deep as half a foot.\n\nLast week, deadly storms struck the Houston area in Texas, claiming the lives of at least eight individuals. These storms, accompanied by hurricane-force winds, caused widespread power outages that left hundreds of thousands without electricity for days, exposing residents to hot and humid conditions without air conditioning. The death toll rose on Tuesday with the inclusion of a man who succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after losing power. Downtown skyscrapers bore the brunt of the hurricane-force winds, resulting in shattered glass and reduced structures to debris.\n\nTuesday's storms were forecasted to bring similar severe weather -- high winds, heavy rain, and large hail -- to Minnesota and parts of northern Missouri, according to Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service. He warned that the system was expected to shift southward on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and southern Missouri.", "source": {"uri":

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Crews moved methodically Wednesday through a small Iowa town devastated by a powerful tornado, searching through mounds of debris to be sure no victims remained buried in the rubble, but authorities would not say how many were killed or injured in the storm.\n\nThe tornado Tuesday afternoon left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\n\"It's still a search mission as far as we're looking to be sure all residents are accounted for,\" said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\nPeople are also reading...

There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, neither Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds nor other officials would give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said initial surveys indicated at least an EF-3 tornado in Greenfield, but additional damage assessment could lead to a more powerful ranking.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nThe deadly twister was spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home gone, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

While Brown was unable to provide additional details on the incident, she attributed the death to a tornado.\n\nThe potent line of thunderstorms that swept through the region on Tuesday prompted a rare \"potentially dangerous situation\" tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This special tornado watch is only issued when there is a high level of confidence in the potential for multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes.\n\nIn response to the storm outbreak, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties, enabling state resources to aid in response and recovery efforts. Governor Reynolds announced her intention to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage firsthand, vowing to provide the full support of the state.\n\nAs of late Tuesday evening, over 30,000 customers were without power in Iowa, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm outbreak on Tuesday also posed other serious hazards, including destructive hurricane-strength wind gusts of up to 90 mph and softball-size hail. More than 25 million people across the region were under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the SPC.\n\nThe largest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centered on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin, and northern Missouri. Major population centers such as Chicago and Milwaukee were also at risk of damaging storms.\n\nThe Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms approached the area, prompting tornado warnings. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed the occurrence of \"multiple tornadoes\" within the county, though no injuries were reported at the time. Damage assessments were underway, with officials working to clear roads for access to affected properties, as reported by CNN.\n\nIn addition to tornadoes, flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall posed a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches were in effect. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches were possible, with some areas expecting up to 5 inches.\n\nSevere storms were forecasted to peak in the Midwest through Tuesday night, with additional severe thunderstorms expected to develop on Wednesday across a 1,500-mile stretch from Texas to western New York. The possibility of damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes persisted, with the region bracing for further impact.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe recent onslaught of severe weather across the United States, including the devastating storm in Houston last Thursday, underscored the urgent need for preparedness and resilience in the face of unpredictable natural

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through the debris strewn on the land where their homes had stood a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But additional damage assessment could show a more powerful tornado.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away from Greenfield, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and huddled in a corner of her basement when the sirens sounded. Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home destroyed, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapses, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Because the local hospital sustained damage in the storm, those people had to be transferred to facilities in nearby towns.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, told CBS affiliate KCCI TV in an interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state.\n\nAt least one person, a woman in Adams County, was listed as a storm-related fatality, the county's medical examiner Lisa Brown said. She spoke to Reuters by phone but said she could not yet provide more details.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, including Adair and Adams, allowing state resources to be readily utilised in responding to the storm.\n\nAlso in Adams County, at least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire, KCCI reported. It said several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nEarlier in the day, the weather service confirmed at least one tornado over Rollingstone, Minnesota.", "source": {"uri":

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through the debris strewn on the land where their homes had stood a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But additional damage assessment could show a more powerful tornado.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.

Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and huddled in a corner of her basement when the sirens sounded. Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said.

Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapses, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Crews moved methodically Wednesday through a small Iowa town devastated by a powerful tornado, searching through mounds of debris to be sure no victims remained buried in the rubble, but authorities would not say how many were killed or injured in the storm.\n\nThe tornado Tuesday afternoon left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\n\"It's still a search mission as far as we're looking to be sure all residents are accounted for,\" said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\nPeople are also reading...

There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, neither Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds nor other officials would give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said initial surveys indicated at least an EF-3 tornado in Greenfield, but additional damage assessment could lead to a more powerful ranking.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nThe deadly twister was spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home gone, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

BECK - Associated Press By HANNAH FINGERHUT, SCOTT McFETRIDGE and MARGERY A. BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- An undisclosed number of people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa, leaving a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars and also twisting and toppling wind turbines outside of the town.\n\nAfter devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states.\n\nThe deadly twister that slammed Iowa came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nHow the feds say they caught one of St. Louis' most prolific cocaine distributors TV Q&A: Where to find the 'Monk' movie Cardinals 'City Connect' uniforms: All you need to know, from new details to Nelly's role MLB's latest broadcast move yet again aggravates some Cardinals fans: Media Views Sultan: Why aren't more of us snacking on cicadas?

How a small gesture revealed ace Sonny Gray's big faith in Cardinals bullpen and manager Firm that accused ex-Mercy executive of bribery and extortion sues the health system\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66.\n\nGreenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nDinkla said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nOn Facebook, people as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos of ripped family photos, check stubs, damp yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the Greenfield tornado.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.\"\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Josh Funk in Omaha, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

BECK - Associated Press\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities in Iowa continued search and rescue efforts Wednesday while surviving residents picked through the debris strewn on the land where their homes had stood a day after a deadly tornado devastated the town of Greenfield and killed an undisclosed number of people.\n\nThe tornado left a wide swath of obliterated homes, splintered trees and crumpled cars in Greenfield, a town of 2,000 about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But additional damage assessment could show a more powerful tornado.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away from Greenfield, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and huddled in a corner of her basement when the sirens sounded. Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home destroyed, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapses, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

One death occurred in Adams County, Iowa, around 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, when a woman was ejected from a vehicle during the brutal storm.\n\nFootage showed widespread damage hours after the tornadoes tore through rural Iowa, including entire trees being shredded from their roots.\n\nThe small town of Greenfield, around 40 miles from the death in Adams County, was among the hardest hit, and a tornado that developed around 5pm leveled hundreds of homes and left several people injured, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla said.\n\nAt a press conference, Dinkla estimated that over a dozen people were hospitalized, but could not offer an exact number. He added that all known residents were accounted for, but searches were still ongoing through the wreckage.\n\nImages shared to Facebook by a Greenfield resident saw entire homes reduced to rubble and turned into scattered debris, while brick walls were flattened by the force of the twister.\n\nMassive wind turbines were also destroyed by the gusts, with at least three turbines destroyed in Adams County, and MidAmerican Energy Company said it owned several more that were destroyed in Adair County.\n\nWhile aiding injured residents, the Adair County Memorial Hospital also 'sustained tornado damage', officials said, that forced it to transfer patients to other nearby medical centers.\n\nGreenfield instated a mandatory curfew from 10pm to 7am as the aftermath is surveyed, however officials said the true extent of the devastation may not be clear until daybreak.\n\nHeavy cleanup crews have been spotted across the state, with unaffected counties including Guthrie and Madison reportedly enlisted to help clear damage in Greenfield.\n\nEarly reports said multiple tornadoes were also reported in Montgomery County, and Meteorologists warned that the storm system across the Midwest may generate several more catastrophic-strength tornadoes.\n\nIn total across the Midwest, over 25 million people were under at least a Level 3 severe thunderstorm warnings on Tuesday evening.\n\nIt comes after a period of intense storms through the nation's heartland in recent days, including three minor tornadoes registered Monday in Minnesota, Nebraska and Colorado.\n\nAlthough much of the early damage was contained to rural Iowa, officials warned that several large cities and population centers could find themselves in the storm's path.\n\nChicago and Milwaukee are both at risk of being hit by destructive storms, and Des Moines International Airport closed its runways in anticipation of tornadoes potentially landing late Tuesday.\n\nMultiple regions have also seen flash flooding due to the storms, with heavy rainfall warnings instated across the Midwest.\n\nThrough Tuesday night, the Storm Prediction Center launched a rare 'potentially dangerous situation' tornado watch spanning Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.\n\nThe tornado watch is only used when experts believe there is a high chance for multiple, long-lasting tornadoes registering at EF2 or stronger, meaning speeds of at least 111mph.\n\nResidents in Greenfield described witnessing the devastation across their town, with Valerie Warrior telling KCCI she was our riding her bike when the storm descended.\n\n'There's houses down all over the place,' Warrior said, noting that she raced to her basement to wait out the tornado before emerging to find the town covered in debris.\n\n'Devastating,' she added.\n\nStunning images from storm chaser Nahel Belgherze focused on the damage seen in one Greenfield street, as a sleepy suburb was turned into rubble within hours.\n\nResident Donnell Griffith said despite the carnage, the small town of roughly 2,000 people will recover from the storms.\n\n'We're a small community, we're a tough community... we will rebuild this community together,' she said.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While Brown was unable to provide additional details on the incident, she attributed the death to a tornado.\n\nThe potent line of thunderstorms that swept through the region on Tuesday prompted a rare \"potentially dangerous situation\" tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This special tornado watch is only issued when there is a high level of confidence in the potential for multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes.\n\nIn response to the storm outbreak, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties, enabling state resources to aid in response and recovery efforts. Governor Reynolds announced her intention to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage firsthand, vowing to provide the full support of the state.\n\nAs of late Tuesday evening, over 30,000 customers were without power in Iowa, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm outbreak on Tuesday also posed other serious hazards, including destructive hurricane-strength wind gusts of up to 90 mph and softball-size hail. More than 25 million people across the region were under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the SPC.\n\nThe largest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centered on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin, and northern Missouri. Major population centers such as Chicago and Milwaukee were also at risk of damaging storms.\n\nThe Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms approached the area, prompting tornado warnings. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed the occurrence of \"multiple tornadoes\" within the county, though no injuries were reported at the time. Damage assessments were underway, with officials working to clear roads for access to affected properties, as reported by CNN.\n\nIn addition to tornadoes, flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall posed a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches were in effect. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches were possible, with some areas expecting up to 5 inches.\n\nSevere storms were forecasted to peak in the Midwest through Tuesday night, with additional severe thunderstorms expected to develop on Wednesday across a 1,500-mile stretch from Texas to western New York. The possibility of damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes persisted, with the region bracing for further impact.\n\nThe recent onslaught of severe weather across the United States, including the devastating storm in Houston last Thursday, underscored the urgent need for preparedness and resilience in the face of unpredictable natural disasters, CNN reported.

In the small city of Greenfield, Iowa, located approximately 50 miles southwest of Des Moines, a destructive storm unleashed a tornado shortly before 5 pm, causing extensive damage to numerous homes and structures, according to Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt Alex Dinkla. \"Sadly, we can confirm that there have been fatalities with this tornado,\" Dinkla stated during a subsequent news conference, though he refrained from providing further details on the casualties.\n\nResidents in Greenfield were also left injured, and a local hospital suffered tornado damage, prompting the transfer of patients to nearby medical facilities, Sgt Dinkla confirmed, according to CNN. Footage captured by CNN affiliate KCCI depicted the trail of destruction left by the tornado in Greenfield, showcasing decimated homes, flattened structures, heaps of debris, damaged vehicles, and countless uprooted trees. \"There is basically nothing left,\" remarked Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative residing half a mile from Greenfield, emphasising the tornado's devastating impact.\n\nTragically, another storm-related fatality occurred in Adams County, Iowa, approximately 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, as confirmed by county medical examiner Lisa Brown. While Brown was unable to provide additional details on the incident, she attributed the death to a tornado. The potent line of thunderstorms that swept through the region on Tuesday prompted a rare \"potentially dangerous situation\" tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This special tornado watch is only issued when there is a high level of confidence in the potential for multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes.\n\nIn response to the storm outbreak, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties, enabling state resources to aid in response and recovery efforts. Governor Reynolds announced her intention to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage firsthand, vowing to provide the full support of the state. As of late Tuesday evening, over 30,000 customers were without power in Iowa, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm outbreak on Tuesday also posed other serious hazards, including destructive hurricane-strength wind gusts of up to 90 mph and softball-size hail. More than 25 million people across the region were under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the SPC. The largest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centered on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin, and northern Missouri. Major population centers such as Chicago and Milwaukee were also at risk of damaging storms.\n\nThe Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms approached the area, prompting tornado warnings. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed the occurrence of \"multiple tornadoes\" within the county, though no injuries were reported at the time. Damage assessments were underway, with officials working to clear roads for access to affected properties, as reported by CNN. In addition to tornadoes, flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall posed a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches were in effect. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches were possible, with some areas expecting up to 5 inches.\n\nSevere storms were forecasted to peak in the Midwest through Tuesday night, with additional severe thunderstorms expected to develop on Wednesday across a 1,500-mile stretch from Texas to western New York. The possibility of damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes persisted, with the region bracing for further impact. The recent onslaught of severe weather across the United States, including the devastating storm in Houston last Thursday, underscored the urgent need for preparedness and resilience in the face of unpredictable natural disasters, CNN reported.

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles east of Eau Claire, meteorologist Roy Eckberg said. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there.\n\nEckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau.\n\nWeather service staff will also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office.\n\n\"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n\"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,\" Paxton said. \"Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ...

It is a mess.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm.\n\n\"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road,\" she said of the tornado.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" she said in a statement. \"Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nIowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night.\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice.\n\nIn Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nBob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\nPhotos: Tornado devastates Greenfield as powerful storms sweep through Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa Severe Weather Iowa\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In the small city of Greenfield, Iowa, located approximately 50 miles southwest of Des Moines, a destructive storm unleashed a tornado shortly before 5 pm, causing extensive damage to numerous homes and structures, according to Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt Alex Dinkla. \"Sadly, we can confirm that there have been fatalities with this tornado,\" Dinkla stated during a subsequent news conference, though he refrained from providing further details on the casualties.\n\nResidents in Greenfield were also left injured, and a local hospital suffered tornado damage, prompting the transfer of patients to nearby medical facilities, Sgt Dinkla confirmed, according to CNN. Footage captured by CNN affiliate KCCI depicted the trail of destruction left by the tornado in Greenfield, showcasing decimated homes, flattened structures, heaps of debris, damaged vehicles, and countless uprooted trees. \"There is basically nothing left,\" remarked Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative residing half a mile from Greenfield, emphasising the tornado's devastating impact.\n\nTragically, another storm-related fatality occurred in Adams County, Iowa, approximately 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, as confirmed by county medical examiner Lisa Brown. While Brown was unable to provide additional details on the incident, she attributed the death to a tornado. The potent line of thunderstorms that swept through the region on Tuesday prompted a rare \"potentially dangerous situation\" tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This special tornado watch is only issued when there is a high level of confidence in the potential for multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes.\n\nIn response to the storm outbreak, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties, enabling state resources to aid in response and recovery efforts. Governor Reynolds announced her intention to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage firsthand, vowing to provide the full support of the state. As of late Tuesday evening, over 30,000 customers were without power in Iowa, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm outbreak on Tuesday also posed other serious hazards, including destructive hurricane-strength wind gusts of up to 90 mph and softball-size hail. More than 25 million people across the region were under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the SPC. The largest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centered on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin, and northern Missouri. Major population centers such as Chicago and Milwaukee were also at risk of damaging storms.\n\nThe Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms approached the area, prompting tornado warnings. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed the occurrence of \"multiple tornadoes\" within the county, though no injuries were reported at the time. Damage assessments were underway, with officials working to clear roads for access to affected properties, as reported by CNN. In addition to tornadoes, flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall posed a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches were in effect. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches were possible, with some areas expecting up to 5 inches.\n\nSevere storms were forecasted to peak in the Midwest through Tuesday night, with additional severe thunderstorms expected to develop on Wednesday across a 1,500-mile stretch from Texas to western New York. The possibility of damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes persisted, with the region bracing for further impact. The recent onslaught of severe weather across the United States, including the devastating storm in Houston last Thursday, underscored the urgent need for preparedness and resilience in the face of unpredictable natural disasters, CNN reported.", "source": {"uri": "newsd.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsd.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado",

The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, neither Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds nor other officials would give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said initial surveys indicated at least an EF-3 tornado in Greenfield, but additional damage assessment could lead to a more powerful ranking.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nThe deadly twister was spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAbout 90 miles away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home gone, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\n___\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

While Brown was unable to provide additional details on the incident, she attributed the death to a tornado.\n\nThe potent line of thunderstorms that swept through the region on Tuesday prompted a rare \"potentially dangerous situation\" tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This special tornado watch is only issued when there is a high level of confidence in the potential for multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes.\n\nIn response to the storm outbreak, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties, enabling state resources to aid in response and recovery efforts. Governor Reynolds announced her intention to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage firsthand, vowing to provide the full support of the state.\n\nAs of late Tuesday evening, over 30,000 customers were without power in Iowa, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm outbreak on Tuesday also posed other serious hazards, including destructive hurricane-strength wind gusts of up to 90 mph and softball-size hail. More than 25 million people across the region were under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the SPC.\n\nThe largest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centered on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin, and northern Missouri. Major population centers such as Chicago and Milwaukee were also at risk of damaging storms.\n\nThe Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms approached the area, prompting tornado warnings. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed the occurrence of \"multiple tornadoes\" within the county, though no injuries were reported at the time. Damage assessments were underway, with officials working to clear roads for access to affected properties, as reported by CNN.\n\nIn addition to tornadoes, flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall posed a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches were in effect. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches were possible, with some areas expecting up to 5 inches.\n\nSevere storms were forecasted to peak in the Midwest through Tuesday night, with additional severe thunderstorms expected to develop on Wednesday across a 1,500-mile stretch from Texas to western New York. The possibility of damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes persisted, with the region bracing for further impact.\n\nThe recent onslaught of severe weather across the United States, including the devastating storm in Houston last Thursday, underscored the urgent need for preparedness and resilience in the face of unpredictable natural disasters, CNN reported.

I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, told CBS affiliate KCCI TV in an interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state.\n\nAt least one person, a woman in Adams County, was listed as a storm-related fatality, the county's medical examiner Lisa Brown said. She spoke to Reuters by phone but said she could not yet provide more details.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, including Adair and Adams, allowing state resources to be readily utilized in responding to the storm.\n\nAlso in Adams County, at least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire, KCCI reported. It said several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nEarlier in the day, the weather service confirmed at least one tornado over Rollingstone, Minnesota.\n\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles;

Alex Dinkla told CNN. Officials would not elaborate on the number or nature of the deaths because of the active search and rescue, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nMore than 100 first responders were combing through the wreckage of the town Wednesday, Reynolds said. The city's hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred.\n\nA \"makeshift hospital\" was set up in the city's lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath.\n\n\"We pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\" Sorensen recalled.\n\nThe damage to the city is immense. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees.\n\n\"It's horrific,\" Reynolds said Wednesday. \"It's hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\"\n\nAt least 18 tornadoes were reported in Iowa Tuesday - part of a torrent of storms that have left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week.\n\nTornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far this year make it one of the most active years for twisters on record.\n\nMore than 50,000 homes and businesses are in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. More outages are anticipated as storms roll through the East.\n\nWednesday's severe thunderstorm threat is slightly less intense than Tuesday's, but dangerous storms remain possible. Damaging winds, hail and some tornadoes could occur along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western Vermont.\n\nEnergetic storms rumbled to life Wednesday morning in parts of Oklahoma. Additional thunderstorms will fire up throughout the day and likely reach peak in strength in parts of the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley during the afternoon and evening.\n\nSevere storms are also likely to fire up from the Ohio Valley through the Northeast Wednesday afternoon. These storms could be slightly less organized and widespread than those in the South, but damaging wind gusts and hail are possible. The tornado threat is very limited in this area.\n\nCities including Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus, Ohio, should be storm-aware.\n\nSome Iowa neighborhoods left in ruins\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms tore through the state.\n\nGreenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms' catastrophic impacts.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \"critical public facilities,\" emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing.\n\nBut Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday's event.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nValerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI.\n\n\"I was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\" she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \"I heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\"\n\nWarrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis.\n\n\"They'll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that's what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\"\n\nFighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile.\n\n\"We'll rebuild,\" she said. \"We'll rebuild.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Live updates\n\nJohn Bacon, Kyle Werner and Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, USA TODAY\n\nUpdated May 22, 2024 at 5:28 PM\n\nGREENFIELD, Iowa -- Authorities were still counting the dead and wounded in this small southwestern Iowa town Wednesday, hours after a series of tornadoes and powerful storms smashed through several Midwestern states, killing multiple residents and injuring at least a dozen others.\n\nTornadoes, storm damage and power outages were also reported in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. The National Weather Service was reviewing almost two dozen tornado reports in the four states, where 100,000 homes and businesses were without power early Wednesday.\n\nIn Greenfield, Luke Daughenbaugh was outside when the tornado struck.\n\n\"It put me on the ground, and then I just curled up in like fetal position. And pretty soon the garage walls were on top of me,\" Daughenbaugh said Wednesday as he began cleaning up. \"I thought I was going to die there.\"\n\nThe storms are the latest in a stretch of severe weather that has been sweeping across the Midwest since eight people died in the Houston area last week. More than 70,000 homes and businesses remained without power in Texas on Wednesday. And more dangerous weather was forecast for areas stretching from Texas to New England in coming days.\n\nMultiple rounds of dangerous weather will target the Plains, Midwest and mid-South through Memorial Day weekend, weather.com warned. Tornadoes, destructive straight-line wind, damaging winds and flooding rainfall are possible.\n\n\"A broad zone of the Central states will face at least some severe weather through the end of the week and into the weekend, allowing for no rest for storm-fatigued residents,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Alyssa Glenny said.\n\nMultiple deaths, extensive damage: Powerful tornado rips through Iowa\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e In Wisconsin, winds of up to 70 mph were recorded across much of the state. Authorities were assessing damage, and public schools were closed Wednesday in Madison.\n\n\u220e In Illinois, high winds toppled trees and knocked out power in some areas around Chicago. Dust storms closed multiple interstates and prompted travel alerts in at least six counties.\n\nEast Coast cities bracing for storms\n\nScattered thunderstorms Wednesday night, some capable of producing a few tornadoes, will extend along a nearly 2,000-mile-long swath from the Rio Grande River in Texas to the St. Lawrence River in New York, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said. AccuWeather warned that northern Texas through southern Oklahoma and Arkansas will be the \"hotbed\" of thunderstorm development in the short term.\n\nThursday could bring severe thunderstorms to the East, from Boston through New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and on into the Raleigh, North Carolina, metro area, AccuWeather said. Dallas, Nashville, Cincinnati and Chicago are among the cities downpours Friday could reduce visibility, create ponding and slow travel.\n\nWoman's home destroyed 56 years after grandparents lost house\n\nAuthorities in Story County, Iowa, said a tornado slammed through the the towns of Cambridge, Nevada, and Colo Tuesday evening, knocking down power lines, damaging houses, and scattering debris throughout the area. Less than two hours later, June and Larry Handsacker were already on the scene, pulling valued possessions from the wreckage.\n\nJune Handsacker's grandparents lost their home in a tornado in 1968, and her grandfather was trapped for three days in his car, she said. On Tuesday, June was in the dining room of her own home when a tornado roared through. She and her husband had to crawl over the debris to get out. She said she and her husband know they're lucky they came away unscathed; they believe that God was looking out for them.\n\n\"It pays to teach Sunday school!\" she said.\n\n- Addison Lathers, Celia Brocker and Kate Kealey, Ames Tribune\n\nMuch of Greenfield flattened, but courthouse spared\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds arrived in Greenfield, apparently the hardest-hit area of the state, to view the destruction. The center of the southwestern Iowa town of 2,000 people was almost completely flattened. Piles of splintered wood, siding and destroyed furniture were all that remained of many homes. Trees were uprooted or stripped of their bark. The hospital was damaged, power lines were toppled, and dozens of emergency vehicles lined streets that were no longer passable.\n\nSgt. Alex Dinkla, spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, said the tornado appeared to move through the southwest side of Greenfield. The historic town square, with the Warren Opera House and courthouse, appears to have been spared, he said.\n\nIowa governor declares disaster emergency\n\n\"While it's too soon to know the storm's full impact, answers will come in the hours and days ahead,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said ahead of her visit.\n\nParts of Iowa were hit with more than 3 inches of rain, and the National Weather Service issued multiple flood warnings across Iowa as rivers and creeks swelled. Reynolds declared a disaster emergency for 15 Iowa counties and pledged state support in rebuilding communities. It's the second round of tornadoes the state has faced in a month - more than a dozen tornadoes pounded the state April 26.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Greenfield resident Valerie Warrior told CBS affiliate KCCI TV as she stood near demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nIowa death toll still not determined\n\nDinkla said at a briefing late Tuesday that the exact number of those killed or injured was not yet available, but he estimated at least a dozen people were hospitalized. Drone video posted to social media shows the path the tornado took through town with structures in its path destroyed and cars flipped. Those on the periphery sustained damage, some with roofs completely gone.\n\nOther tornadoes swept through the Iowa town of Red Oak, 60 miles to the southwest, and Stanton, about 10 miles outside Red Oak. The National Weather Service in Des Moines said three survey teams would be assessing damage.\n\n\"We have many other areas with tornadoes and other damage as well to review so the entire storm survey process will take time,\" the weather service said in a social media post. \"Please be patient! We will post updates as they become available.\"\n\nContributing: Phillip Sitter and Lee Rood, Des Moines Register; Reuters\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Live updates: Severe

Alex Dinkla told CNN. Dinkla did not elaborate on the number or nature of the deaths.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees.\n\nAt least 17 tornado reports were generated in Iowa Tuesday - part of a parade of storms that has been marching across the US this week, leaving widespread power outages, structural damage and some flooding in their wake.\n\nPower outages across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois left nearly 200,000 homes and businesses in the dark as of Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us. Even more outages are anticipated as Wednesday's storms roll through the East.\n\nOn Wednesday, the severe thunderstorm threat weakens slightly but is expected to unleash harsh winds, hail and some tornadoes along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western New York.\n\n\"Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for damaging gusts and hail will be possible from central Texas into the Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes area on Wednesday. The greatest threat of damaging hail and wind is forecast from north Texas across the Ozarks,\" the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nA handful of tornadoes could strike from Texas to Kentucky, but hail and powerful winds are possible anywhere along the storms' path.\n\nNearly 11 million people are under an enhanced risk, Level 3 of 5, risk of thunderstorms across northern Texas, southern Oklahoma, southern Missouri and much of Arkansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This area includes the populous Texas cities of Dallas, Forth Worth and Arlington.\n\nThough under a less severe risk Wednesday, cities including Nashville, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus should be storm-aware.\n\nTornadoes tear deadly and destructive path through Iowa\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms prompted rare, escalated levels of tornado watches across parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.\n\nWestern Iowa bore the brunt of the storms' catastrophic impacts. Violent winds and possible tornadoes flattened buildings in Greenfield, toppled a hulking wind turbine in Prescott and reduced several people's homes to mountains of jagged debris.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said.\n\nHeaps of rubble blanket Greenfield, Iowa, after a tornado touched down Tuesday. Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nMore than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \"critical public facilities,\" emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing.\n\nValerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told CNN affiliate KCCI.\n\n\"I was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\" she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \"I heard it and I knew it was hitting.\"\n\nWarrior said the scale of damage is \"devastating\" to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis.\n\n\"They'll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that's what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\"\n\nFighting back tears, Warrior looked out across a rubble-strewn lawn and tried to crack a smile.\n\n\"We'll rebuild, we'll rebuild.\"\n\nCNN's Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alex Dinkla told CNN. Dinkla did not elaborate on the number or nature of the deaths.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees.\n\nValerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI.\n\n\"I was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\" she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \"I heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\"\n\nWarrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis.\n\n\"They'll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that's what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\"\n\nFighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile.\n\n\"We'll rebuild,\" she said. \"We'll rebuild.\"\n\nAt least 17 tornado reports were generated in Iowa Tuesday - part of a torrent of storms that have left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week.\n\nNearly 80,000 homes and businesses are in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. More outages are anticipated as storms roll through the East.\n\nOn Wednesday, the severe thunderstorm threat weakens slightly but is expected to unleash harsh winds, hail and some tornadoes along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western Vermont.\n\n\"Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for damaging gusts and hail will be possible from central Texas into the Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes area on Wednesday. The greatest threat of damaging hail and wind is forecast from north Texas across the Ozarks,\" the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nA few tornadoes could strike from Texas to Arkansas, but hail and powerful winds are possible anywhere along the storms' path.\n\nThe strongest impacts will be felt from central Texas to southeast Oklahoma and central Arkansas, including in Dallas, Fort Worth and Little Rock. Hail larger than 2 inches in diameter, wind gusts up to 74 mph and some tornadoes could hit.\n\nThough under a less severe risk Wednesday, cities including Nashville, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus should also be storm-aware.\n\nSome Iowa neighborhoods left in ruins\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms prompted rare, escalated levels of tornado watches across parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.\n\nWestern Iowa bore the brunt of the storms' catastrophic impacts. Violent winds and possible tornadoes flattened buildings in Greenfield, toppled a hulking wind turbine in Prescott and reduced several people's homes to mountains of jagged debris.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said.\n\nMore than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \"critical public facilities,\" emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing.\n\nCNN's Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Alex Dinkla, a spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, during an evening press conference in Greenfield.\n\n\"We can confirm there have been multiple fatalities with this tornado.\"\n\nDinkla did not provide a death toll, but said it may not be before Wednesday that figures could be provided.\n\nAt least a dozen people in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 people, were injured in the twister, Dinkla said. Because the local hospital sustained damage in the storm, those people had to be transferred to facilities in nearby towns.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, told CBS affiliate KCCI TV in an interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state.\n\nAt least one person, a woman in Adams County, was listed as a storm-related fatality, the county's medical examiner Lisa Brown said. She spoke to Reuters by phone but said she could not yet provide more details.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, including Adair and Adams, allowing state resources to be readily utilized in responding to the storm.\n\nAlso in Adams County, at least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire, KCCI reported. It said several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nEarlier in the day, the weather service confirmed at least one tornado over Rollingstone, Minnesota. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_barreiro_jr@rappler.com", "name": "Victor Barreiro Jr.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCCI", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KCCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_seat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County seat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollingstone,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rollingstone, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rollingstone, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/05/iowa-tornado-may-21-2024-reuters.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 232, "textEnd": 238}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Alex Dinkla.\n\n\"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities,\" Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. \"We're still counting at this time.\"\n\nHe said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post on Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nThe tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometres) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports on Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. on Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometres) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg.\n\nHe said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the

The twister also ripped apart and crumpled massive power-producing wind turbines several miles outside the town.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nGreenfield resident Kimberly Ergish and her husband dug through the debris field Wednesday that used to be their home, looking for family photos and other salvageable items. There wasn't much left, she acknowledged.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Most of it we can't save,\" she said. \"But we're going to get what we can.\"\n\nThe reality of having her house destroyed in a matter of seconds hasn't really set in, she said.\n\n\"If it weren't for all the bumps and bruises and the achy bones, I would think that it didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nAbout 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Greenfield, a woman died Tuesday when the vehicle she was driving was blown off the road near Corning, Iowa, the Adams County Sheriff's office said. The woman's name and age were not immediately released.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other officials held a news conference Wednesday morning but declined to give details of the number of dead and missing in Greenfield, noting that the amount of devastation and debris made it difficult to be sure.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLater Tuesday, the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. The severe weather was expected to turn south on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for the midsection of Texas -- including Dallas -- until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday that initial surveys confirmed the damage in Greenfield indicated at least an EF-3 tornado, which would have wind speeds of 136 to 165 mph (219 to 265 kph). But additional damage assessment could show a more powerful tornado.\n\nThe deadly twister spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S., at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country.\n\nThrough Tuesday, there have been 859 confirmed tornadoes this year, 27% more than the U.S. sees on average, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. So far, Iowa's had the most, with 81 confirmed twisters.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, the National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports, with most in Iowa and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe tornado that decimated parts of Greenfield brought to life the worst case scenario in Iowa that weather forecasters had feared, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"Debris was lifted thousands of feet in the air and ended up falling to the ground several counties away from Greenfield. That's evidence of just how intense and deadly this tornado was,\" Porter said.\n\nPeople as far as 100 miles (160 kilometers) away from Greenfield posted photos on Facebook of ripped family photos, yearbook pages and other items that were lifted into the sky by the tornado.\n\nAbout 90 miles away from Greenfield, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring \"This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District\" stuck to her garage door like a Post-It note after the storm passed.\n\n\"We just couldn't believe it had traveled that far,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado appeared to have been on the ground for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers), Porter said. A satellite photo taken by a BlackSky Technology shows where the twister gouged a nearly straight path of destruction through the town, just south of Greenfield's center square.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said FEMA's administrator would head to Iowa on Thursday and that the White House was in touch with state and local officials. She said they were \"praying for those who tragically lost their lives\" and wished those injured a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nGreenfield's 25-bed hospital was among the buildings damaged, and at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere. A triage center was set up for the injured at the Greenfield high school, and a Methodist Church also was being used to treat the injured.\n\nResidential streets that on Monday were lined with old-growth trees and neatly-appointed ranch-style homes were a chaotic jumble of splintered and smashed remnants by Wednesday. Many of the homes' basements where residents sheltered lay exposed and front yards were littered with belongings from furniture to children's toys and Christmas decorations.\n\nErgish, 33, said she gathered her four kids and huddled in a corner of her basement when the sirens sounded. Seconds later, they were covered in the debris from their destroyed home.\n\n\"It was like 10 seconds of pure terror,\" she said. \"It felt like it lasted a lifetime.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDwight Lahey, a 70-year-old retired truck driver, drove from suburban Des Moines to Greenfield to help his 98-year-old mother. She had taken refuge from the twister in her basement, then walked out through her destroyed garage to a nearby convenience store, Lahey said.\n\n\"I don't know how she got through that mess,\" he said. His mom was staying in a hotel, uncertain about where she'll end up with her home destroyed, he said.\n\nRoseann Freeland, 67, waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room her basement. Seconds later, her husband opened the door \"and you could just see daylight,\" Freeland said. \"I just lost it. I just totally lost it.\"\n\nThe tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines just southwest of the town. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds.\n\nMidAmerican Energy said six of its turbines collapses, and several registered wind speeds over 100 mph (160 kph) as the tornado approached.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This was an unprecedented impact on our wind fleet, and we have operated wind farms since 2004,\" a statement from MidAmerican read. \"We have experienced only one other instance of a wind turbine collapse, which was also caused by a tornado.\"\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage.\n\n\"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,\" she said.\n\nTuesday's destructive weather also saw flooding and power outages in Nebraska, damage from tornadoes in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and dust storms in Illinois that forced two interstates to be closed.\n\nThe devastation in Iowa followed days of extreme weather that ravaged much of the middle section of the country, including Oklahoma and Kansas. Last week, deadly storms hit the Houston area, killing at least seven and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nBeck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

Alex Dinkla told CNN. Dinkla did not elaborate on the number or nature of the deaths.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees.\n\nValerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI.\n\n\"I was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\" she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \"I heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\"\n\nWarrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis.\n\n\"They'll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that's what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\"\n\nFighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile.\n\n\"We'll rebuild,\" she said. \"We'll rebuild.\"\n\nAt least 18 tornadoes were reported in Iowa Tuesday - part of a torrent of storms that have left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week.\n\nTornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far this year make it one of the most active years for twisters on record.\n\nMore than 90,000 homes and businesses are in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. More outages are anticipated as storms roll through the East.\n\nWednesday's severe thunderstorm threat is slightly less intense than Tuesday's, but dangerous storms remain possible. Damaging winds, hail and some tornadoes could occur along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western Vermont.\n\nEnergetic storms rumbled to life Wednesday morning in parts of Oklahoma. Additional thunderstorms will fire up throughout the day and likely reach peak in strength in parts of the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley during the afternoon and evening.\n\nSevere storms are also likely to fire up from the Ohio Valley through the Northeast Wednesday afternoon. These storms could be slightly less organized and widespread than those in the South, but damaging wind gusts and hail are possible. The tornado threat is very limited in this area.\n\nCities including Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus, Ohio, should be storm-aware.\n\nSome Iowa neighborhoods left in ruins\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms tore through the state.\n\nWestern Iowa bore the brunt of the storms' catastrophic impacts. A tornado flattened buildings in Greenfield, toppled a hulking wind turbine in Prescott and reduced several people's homes to mountains of jagged debris.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said.\n\nMore than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \"critical public facilities,\" emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing.\n\nCNN's Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson and Mary Gilbert contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The National Weather Service was reviewing almost two dozen tornado reports in the four states, where 100,000 homes and businesses were without power early Wednesday.\n\nThe storms are the latest in a stretch of severe weather that has been sweeping across the Midwest since eight people died in the Houston area last week. More dangerous weather was forecast for areas stretching from Texas to New England in coming days.\n\nMultiple deaths, extensive damage after powerful tornado rips through Iowa: Updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e Multiple rounds of dangerous weather will target the Plains, Midwest and mid-South through Memorial Day weekend, weather.com warned. Tornadoes, destructive straight-line wind, damaging winds and flooding rainfall are possible.\n\n\u220e In Wisconsin, winds of up to 70 mph were recorded across much of the state. Authorities were assessing damage, and public schools were closed Wednesday in Madison.\n\n\u220e High winds toppled trees and knocked out power in some areas around Chicago. And dust storms closed multiple interstates and prompted travel alerts in six Illinois counties.\n\n\u220e Greenfield appeared to be hardest hit. The center of the southwestern Iowa town of 2,000 people was almost completely flattened. Piles of splintered wood, siding and destroyed furniture were all that remained of many homes. Trees were uprooted or stripped of their bark. Power lines were toppled and dozens of emergency vehicles lined streets that were no longer passable.\n\nIowa governor declares disaster emergency\n\n\"While it's too soon to know the storm's full impact, answers will come in the hours and days ahead,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said ahead of a planned visit here Wednesday.\n\nReynolds declared a disaster emergency for 15 Iowa counties and pledged state support in rebuilding communities. It's the second round of tornadoes the state has faced in a month - more than a dozen tornadoes pounded the state April 26.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Greenfield resident Valerie Warrior told CBS affiliate KCCI TV as she stood near demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nIowa death toll still not determined\n\nSgt. Alex Dinkla, spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, said at a briefing late Tuesday that the exact number of those killed or injured was not yet available, but he estimated at least a dozen people were hospitalized. Drone video posted to social media shows the path the tornado took through town with structures in its path destroyed and cars flipped. Those on the periphery sustained damage, some with roofs completely gone.\n\nOther tornadoes swept through the Iowa town of Red Oak, 60 miles to the southwest, and Stanton, about 10 miles outside Red Oak. The National Weather Service in Des Moines said three survey teams would be assessing damage.\n\n\"We have many other areas with tornadoes and other damage as well to review so the entire storm survey process will take time,\" the weather service said in a social media post. \"Please be patient! We will post updates as they become available.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "live_updates@usatoday.com", "name": "Live Updates",

It's not fully condensed to the ground at all times. You can see it's kind of grungy looking,\" he said. \"You can sort of see through it at times. But there's definitely circulation all the way to the ground.\"\n\nMultiple wind turbines were destroyed by the tornado as it ripped across the county. Satre said he observed at least three 250-foot towers snapped like twigs, their blades scattered across the area.\n\nStunning footage captured the violent twister snapping a wind turbine.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccuWeather", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AccuWeather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paxton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paxton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOI-DT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WOI-DT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clel_Baudler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clel Baudler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCCI", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KCCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2331-1600x900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood -- barely -- bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76 meters) wind turbines. Des Moines, Iowa, television station KCCI-TV showed at least three wind turbines that were toppled by an apparent tornado in southwest Iowa, and at least one was in flames with black smoke pluming from the bent structure.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThough the Chicago area has avoided the worst of possible severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, strong winds were likely the primary factor in widespread power outages, which left more than 12,000 ComEd customers without power in northern Illinois.\n\nWhile over 4,000 outages were reported outside of the Chicago area in Stephenson County, hundreds were left in the dark in Lake and DuPage counties, with hundreds of outages reported in Cook County as well.\n\nThe threat for \"widely scattered storms\" will continue for the remainder of Tuesday evening, with gusty winds and hail serving as the primary threat for most of the region.\n\nSome western suburbs were also impacted earlier Tuesday by dust storms, with freshly-tilled farmland and windy conditions contributing to extremely hazardous conditions on some Chicago-area roads.\n\nThe storms caused larger problems in downstate Illinois, with closures being initiated on I-55 in McLean County, with closures reported on I-74 as well.\n\nThe Chicago area will get a reprieve from both the heat and severe weather on Wednesday, with high temperatures falling back into the mid 70s with sunny skies and a limited chance of rainfall.\n\nTemperatures will warm a bit as the week comes to an end, with highs in the low 80s anticipated for both Thursday and Friday alongside sunny skies.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

More outages are anticipated as storms roll through the East.\n\nCities like Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee, St. Louis in Missouri, Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio, and Tulsa in Oklahoma \"should be on storm watch,\" according to weather experts who spoke with the press.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds (R-Iowa) issued a disaster emergency proclamation on Tuesday for 15 counties in the Hawkeye State.\n\nStay informed!

Ray Sorensen, who represents Greenfield, said he was painting at a church when the tornado struck around 3 p.m. Tuesday and rushed into town to find numerous homes damaged or completely demolished and nearly all the historic trees in Greenfield uprooted and stripped of limbs.\n\n\"It's a completely different town now,\" Sorensen said.\n\nBut he said that when he arrived at the scene of the devastation, people were already clearing the streets of debris to make way for emergency vehicles and helping those injured get medical attention at a makeshift triage center established at a lumber yard.\n\n\"Everybody became little makeshift ambulances,\" Sorensen said. \"We pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made, threw him in the back of a truck of a guy that isn't even from Iowa and we just made our way to the lumber yard, which was the makeshift hospital.\"\n\nAt least 329 severe storms were reported Tuesday through the nation's midsection from Texas to Michigan, even up in New England. At least 20 tornadoes were confirmed in three states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Most of the twisters swept across Iowa.\n\nMore severe weather is on the way. The highest threat for tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail will be in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, including major cities such as Dallas, Waco, Abilene, Little Rock and Shreveport.\n\nSome damaging winds could also develop in Memphis and Nashville, Louisville, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Rochester, New York.\n\nSevere weather is also expected to stretch into Thursday as the Memorial Day weekend gets underway. Dangerous weather is expected on Thursday through large parts of the Heartland and parts of the South from South Dakota to Texas and east to Tennessee.\n\nOn Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued tornado watches for parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nNearly the entire state of Iowa was under a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation,\" according to the National Weather Service, which issued several tornado warnings before the town of Greenfield was slammed by a funnel cloud.\n\nGov. Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties across the state. On Wednesday, she said the state will ask President Joe Biden to approve federal disaster relief.\n\nThe counties include Adair, Adams, Cass, Clay, Hardin, Harrison, Jasper, Kossuth, Marshall, Montgomery, Page, Palo Alto, Pottawattamie, Tama and Warren.\n\nGov.

On Wednesday, she said the state will ask President Joe Biden to approve federal disaster relief.\n\nSeveral videos obtained by ABC affiliate station WOI-DT in Des Moines captured a large funnel cloud on the ground in Greenfield.\n\nOn Tuesday, WOI reporter Dana Searles, surveying the damage in Des Moines, said, \"This small community has a big chunk destroyed, but about half of it is still intact. From what I've seen, I'd estimate that maybe 75% of it is near to the ground right now.\"\n\nIn Yuma, in northeast Colorado, hail ranging from golf ball to softball size pummeled the area, causing damage to cars and buildings. At one point, the hail was so deep it caused multiple vehicles to get stuck, JJ Unger, a volunteer Yuma firefighter, told ABC News Tuesday.\n\n\"It was like a blizzard hitting for a half hour because of the hail,\" Unger said. \"That's the longest I've seen it hail like that.\"\n\nUnger said he and his fire crew were out spotting for possible tornadoes Monday evening when lightning struck.\n\n\"It was very intense,\" said Unger, adding that he and his crew had to pull over and seek shelter as visibility went to almost zero.\n\nUnger said that when the hail finally let up, a foot of hail was covering his fire engine and roads in the area.\n\nHe said the windshields of his pickup truck and his wife's vehicle were shattered.\n\n\"Almost every home in town has broken windows and I've heard that over a thousand cars were damaged,\" Unger said.\n\nIn Nebraska, hail measuring two inches in diameter fell in Dundy County in the southwest corner of the state, according to local emergency management officials. Winds of over 90 mph were also reported.\n\nMore than half a foot of rain was recorded in Omaha, Nebraska, on Tuesday, producing major flash flooding in the area.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com",

There were multiple casualties in Greenfield, according to KCCI. The State Patrol says that an official number won't be released until later today. While search efforts continue, officials believe everyone in the town of about 2,000 people is accounted for.\n\nKCCI reports that a mandatory curfew is in effect and likely will be for several more days. The State Patrol also says that no one will be allowed into the city unless they have a Greenfield address on their ID. A reunification point has been set up for survivors and is located at Nodoway Valley High School. It is also serving as a temporary shelter for Greenfield residents.\n\nCompounding issues is that the Adair County Health System hospital in Greenfield suffered damage in the storm. A spokesperson for Mercy One told KCCI that they have not released any further details about the condition of the hospital. Officials also say a retirement community was hit by the tornado on Tuesday.\n\nA disaster proclamation has been authorized by Governor Kim Reynolds for 15 Iowa counties impacted by yesterday's severe weather.", "source": {"uri": "khak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.1 KHAK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCCI", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KCCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_High_School_(West_Des_Moines,_Iowa)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valley High School (West Des Moines, Iowa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/675/files/2024/05/attachment-damage.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Alex Dinkla told CNN. Dinkla did not elaborate on the number or nature of the deaths.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees.\n\nAt least 17 tornado reports were generated in Iowa Tuesday - part of a parade of storms that has been marching across the US this week, leaving widespread power outages, structural damage and some flooding in their wake.\n\nPower outages across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois left nearly 200,000 homes and businesses in the dark as of Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us. Even more outages are anticipated as Wednesday's storms roll through the East.\n\nOn Wednesday, the severe thunderstorm threat weakens slightly but is expected to unleash harsh winds, hail and some tornadoes along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western Vermont.\n\n\"Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for damaging gusts and hail will be possible from central Texas into the Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes area on Wednesday. The greatest threat of damaging hail and wind is forecast from north Texas across the Ozarks,\" the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nA few tornadoes could strike from Texas to Arkansas, but hail and powerful winds are possible anywhere along the storms' path.\n\nThe strongest impacts will be felt from central Texas to southeast Oklahoma and central Arkansas, including in Dallas, Fort Worth and Little Rock. Hail larger than 2 inches in diameter, wind gusts up to 74 mph and some tornadoes could hit.\n\nThough under a less severe risk Wednesday, cities including Nashville, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus should also be storm-aware.\n\nSome Iowa neighborhoods left in ruins\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms prompted rare, escalated levels of tornado watches across parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.\n\nWestern Iowa bore the brunt of the storms' catastrophic impacts. Violent winds and possible tornadoes flattened buildings in Greenfield, toppled a hulking wind turbine in Prescott and reduced several people's homes to mountains of jagged debris.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said.\n\nMore than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \"critical public facilities,\" emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing.\n\nValerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told CNN affiliate KCCI.\n\n\"I was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\" she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \"I heard it and I knew it was hitting.\"\n\nWarrior said the scale of damage is \"devastating\" to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis.\n\n\"They'll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that's what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\"\n\nFighting back tears, Warrior looked out across a rubble-strewn lawn and tried to crack a smile.\n\n\"We'll rebuild, we'll rebuild.\"\n\nCNN's Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

Homes crumbled, others were lifted from their foundations, cars were flipped and trees were shredded. The storms come just weeks after tornadoes tore through numerous other Iowa communities.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that it's happened again,\" said Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) in a statement. She plans to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage.\n\n\"Sadly, we can confirm there were fatalities and injuries within the community of Greenfield from this tornado,\" state police said in a statement Tuesday evening. There was no further information about the number of fatalities.\n\nIn addition to Greenfield, Tuesday's twisters also struck near the towns of Red Oak, Villisca, Brooks, Carbon and Corning. At least 20 tornadoes were reported Tuesday, largely in southwest Iowa. More may be confirmed across Minnesota and Wisconsin in the days ahead.\n\nOne woman died after being ejected from a vehicle during the storm near Corning in Adams County, about 70 miles southwest of Des Moines, according to Lisa Brown, the county medical examiner. Storm-chaser video from the area showed wind turbines flattened as the twisters swept by.\n\nDrone footage captured by storm chaser Reed Timmer from the tornado in Greenfield, about 50 miles from Des Moines, showed a violently spinning, massive funnel with smaller vortexes embedded within the primary twister's circulation. The Weather Service issued a warning for the twister 46 minutes before it touched down, giving residents time to shelter.\n\nAfter wreaking havoc in southwest Iowa, the storms raced through the state's central and eastern regions, northern Missouri, southern Minnesota and western and central Wisconsin, prompting dozens of severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings.\n\nTornado watches stretched from northeast Oklahoma into southern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin well into Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors":

Here's what we know about the deadly tornado", "body": "Multiple residents were killed, and at least a dozen others injured, after a tornado hit the small town of Greenfield on May 21.\n\nThe destruction comes after multiple rounds of storms plagued the state Tuesday, and nearly a month after at least 24 tornadoes swept through the state and devastated the western town of Minden.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds announced she would visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess the damage with local officials in a statement made Tuesday night.\n\nHere's what we know so far about Greenfield.\n\nSgt. Alex Dinkla, spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, confirmed the deaths at a news conference Tuesday night and estimated at least a dozen people were hospitalized. He did not know the exact number of those killed or injured. Dinkla did not think people were still missing as of Tuesday evening, but searches were still underway to confirm.\n\nDinkla did tell the Register on Wednesday that the town square and Wilson Opera House were spared.\n\nStructures in the path of the tornado are now rubble, as evidenced by drone video posted to social media.\n\nDamage also extends to the Adair County Health System hospital. The hospital was evacuated, a MercyOne spokesperson told the Des Moines Register.\n\nThe total population of the town located in Adair County about 2,000 people, according to the U.S Census Bureau.\n\nGreenfield is the county seat of Adair County. It's about 60 miles southwest of Des Moines, or about an hour drive, according to Google Maps.\n\nInformation is not yet available about the Greenfield tornado, but meteorologists have described the May 21 tornado as a \"dangerous tornado.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Des Moines will send three survey crews across the state to search for tornado damage on Wednesday. One team will be focused on just the Greenfield area.\n\nGreenfield became a settlement in 1854, according to the Greenfield Chamber Main Street.\n\nIt's home to the Iowa Aviation Museum and Hall of Fame and the Warren Cultural Center -- composed of the 1896 Warren Opera House and adjoining Hetherington and Taylor buildings, according to Greenfield Chamber.\n\nThe Warren Opera House block and Hetherington block is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another National Register of Historic Places listing for Greenfield is Hotel Greenfield, which was built in 1919 for about $65,000, according to the hotel. The hotel was refurbished after it was purchased in 2010 to ADCO Enterprises, according to the hotel.\n\nGreenfield is supposed to host Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa this July as a Day 3 meetup town.

Alex Dinkla, a spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, during an evening press conference in Greenfield.\n\n\"We can confirm there have been multiple fatalities with this tornado.\"\n\nDinkla did not provide a death toll, but said it may not be before Wednesday that figures could be provided.\n\nAt least a dozen people in Greenfield, a town of about 2,000 people, were injured in the twister, Dinkla said. Because the local hospital sustained damage in the storm, those people had to be transferred to facilities in nearby towns.\n\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, told CBS affiliate KCCI TV in an interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state.\n\nAt least one person, a woman in Adams County, was listed as a storm-related fatality, the county's medical examiner Lisa Brown said. She spoke to Reuters by phone but said she could not yet provide more details.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, including Adair and Adams, allowing state resources to be readily utilized in responding to the storm.\n\nAlso in Adams County, at least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire, KCCI reported. It said several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nEarlier in the day, the weather service confirmed at least one tornado over Rollingstone, Minnesota.\n\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Sonali Paul and Michael Perry)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Authorities are still assessing the damage and the number of casualties. Governor Kim Reynolds has declared a disaster emergency, seeking federal assistance for recovery efforts.\n\nRescue teams in Iowa searched through the ruins of homes and buildings in Greenfield on Wednesday, looking for survivors of a deadly tornado that tore through the town the day before.\n\nAuthorities were still determining how many people were killed, injured and displaced by the twister in the farming town of 2,000 located about 60 miles (97 km) west of Des Moines, Sergeant Alex Dinkla, a spokesperson with the Iowa State Patrol, told a news conference. \"It is still a search mission as far as we are looking to make sure all residents are accounted for,\" he said. \"When we have this many homes that have been destroyed, fully demolished, we want to make sure every person is accounted for.\"\n\nImages from Greenfield showed a path of utter destruction, with homes reduced to splinters, debris strewn everywhere and several large wind turbines toppled. \"It's horrific. It's hard to describe,\" said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who declared a disaster emergency for 15 counties.\n\nThe twister that touched down in Greenfield was among a swarm of tornadoes that were reported in southwestern Iowa on Tuesday evening. At least one person, a woman in nearby Adams County, was killed in the storms, the county's medical examiner said. Reynolds said state officials were working to send a request for President Joe Biden to approve a disaster declaration in order to get federal assistance for state residents.\n\nAmong the buildings damaged in Greenfield was a hospital, forcing authorities to create a makeshift medical care center at the lumberyard and send some of the injured to other area facilities. State Representative Ray Sorensen said several residents used their own vehicles to transport those who were injured to safety moments after the storm struck.\n\n\"We pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher we made and threw him in the back of a truck,\" he said. Tornadoes along with severe storms packing large hail and damaging winds were likely again on Wednesday across the Southern Plains as well as Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, the National Weather Service warned.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Sorensen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray Sorensen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Plains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_25_10_8590644.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Hours after a tornado touched down in Greenfield, about 55 miles from Des Moines, aerial footage showed where the tornadoes tore through the town as homes were leveled and trees were shredded down to their stumps. Wendi Rae, a reporter from Greenfield, posted an emotional video and horrific pictures of the aftermath that has taken over her hometown.\n\n'This is the damage along Highway 25 in Greenfield. There are houses completely gone, so it's really devastating,' Rae said. 'Everybody's out right now just checking on each other- this town is full of a lot of really good-hearted people, so send us your prayers because there is a lot of devastation here right now.'\n\nIowa Police confirmed that multiple people died in the deadly weather front. One death occurred in Adams County, around 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, when a woman was ejected from a vehicle during the brutal storm. Rae's video showed the destruction in the small town with a population of a little more than 2,000 people. She explained that her family's house is 'relatively OK,' but that others in the area weren't as fortunate.\n\nAs she walked along the highway, residents were seen trying to start the massive clean up process. Piles of wood replaced houses, trees were seen sliced in half and furniture was scattered across the neighborhood. Rae also posted photos of the disastrous aftermath, as one showed a red car, covered in dust and dirt, flipped on its hood, as a seat cushion dangled from a nearby tree.\n\nAnother image showed the inside of a home with beat up walls, disheveled furniture and wood and branches breaking through the window. One image captured an American flag slanted, hanging off of a wooden post, as piles upon piles of debris surrounded it. 'Please pray for my hometown! The damage is absolutely devastating. There are no words,' Rae captioned the post.\n\nEntire neighborhoods were flattened by several deadly twisters that gripped the region as Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds placed 15 counties under disaster emergency proclamations. Carnage is expected to continue through the Midwest as a storm system develops - with over 25 million people currently under severe weather warnings, stretching from Missouri to Wisconsin . Along with the Hawkeye State, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Illinois were also hit by tornadoes, heavy rain and power outages, BBC reported.\n\nOverhead footage showed widespread damage hours after the tornadoes tore through rural Iowa, including entire trees being shredded from their roots. Greenfield, around 40 miles from the death in Adams County, was among the hardest hit, as a tornado that developed around 5pm leveled hundreds of homes and left several people injured, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla said. At a press conference, Dinkla estimated that over a dozen people were hospitalized, but could not offer an exact number. He added that all known residents were accounted for, but searches were still ongoing through the wreckage.\n\nA local hospital was hit by the fierce tornadoes, forcing staff and patients to evacuate the ransacked buildings and set up field hospitals at nearby high schools. Massive wind turbines were also destroyed by the gusts, with at least three turbines destroyed in Adams County. MidAmerican Energy Company said it owned several more that were destroyed in Adair County. While aiding injured residents, the Adair County Memorial Hospital also 'sustained tornado damage', officials said, that forced it to transfer patients to other nearby medical centers.\n\nGreenfield instated a mandatory curfew from 10pm to 7am as the aftermath is surveyed, however officials said the true extent of the devastation may not be clear until Wednesday morning. Heavy cleanup crews have been spotted across the state, with unaffected counties including Guthrie and Madison reportedly enlisted to help clear damage in Greenfield. Early reports said multiple tornadoes were also reported in Montgomery County, and Meteorologists warned that the storm system across the Midwest may generate several more catastrophic-strength tornadoes.\n\nIn total across the Midwest, over 25million people were under at least a Level 3 severe thunderstorm warning on Tuesday evening. Midwesterners are now preparing for yet another storm that is expected to roll through central Texas all the way to upstate New York this week. The system is expected to bring hail, damaging winds and tornadoes, with a severe weather threat in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nWind damage and hail, possibly golf ball sized or larger, are the primary concerns, but meteorologists warn a few tornados are also expected. Northern Texas, southeast Oklahoma, northern and central Arkansas, southern Missouri and western Tennessee are most likely to be hit by twisters. Strong storms will fire up today across the Midwest, western New York and Pennsylvania, but the threat of severe weather will continue into tomorrow. Forecasters are primarily concerned about regions in northern Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, southwest Missouri and southern Kansas.\n\nThe risk of strong winds tomorrow is greatest from Wichita, Kansas to Oklahoma City, Dallas and Little Rock. AccuWeather forecasters have predicted winds could reach speeds of 60 to 70mph. A corridor from the Arklatex to the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio River valleys will be hit with rounds of heavy rain today and tomorrow. The area will see between 2 to 4 inches of rain over a 48-hour period, putting residents at a risk for flash flooding. Parts of the Midwest, as well as regions in the south and east, could also see scattered, severe thunderstorms from Friday and throughout the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Alex Dinkla told CNN. Dinkla did not elaborate on the number or nature of the deaths.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees.\n\nAt least 17 tornado reports were generated in Iowa Tuesday - part of a parade of storms that has been marching across the US this week, leaving widespread power outages, structural damage and some flooding in their wake.\n\nPower outages across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois left nearly 200,000 homes and businesses in the dark as of Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us. Even more outages are anticipated as Wednesday's storms roll through the East.\n\nOn Wednesday, the severe thunderstorm threat weakens slightly but is expected to unleash harsh winds, hail and some tornadoes along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western New York.\n\n\"Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for damaging gusts and hail will be possible from central Texas into the Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes area on Wednesday. The greatest threat of damaging hail and wind is forecast from north Texas across the Ozarks,\" the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nA handful of tornadoes could strike from Texas to Kentucky, but hail and powerful winds are possible anywhere along the storms' path.\n\nNearly 11 million people are under an enhanced risk, Level 3 of 5, risk of thunderstorms across northern Texas, southern Oklahoma, southern Missouri and much of Arkansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This area includes the populous Texas cities of Dallas, Forth Worth and Arlington.\n\nThough under a less severe risk Wednesday, cities including Nashville, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus should be storm-aware.\n\nTornadoes tear deadly and destructive path through Iowa\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms prompted rare, escalated levels of tornado watches across parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.\n\nWestern Iowa bore the brunt of the storms' catastrophic impacts. Violent winds and possible tornadoes flattened buildings in Greenfield, toppled a hulking wind turbine in Prescott and reduced several people's homes to mountains of jagged debris.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said.\n\nMore than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \"critical public facilities,\" emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing.\n\nValerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told CNN affiliate KCCI.\n\n\"I was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\" she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \"I heard it and I knew it was hitting.\"\n\nWarrior said the scale of damage is \"devastating\" to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis.\n\n\"They'll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that's what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\"\n\nFighting back tears, Warrior looked out across a rubble-strewn lawn and tried to crack a smile.\n\n\"We'll rebuild, we'll rebuild.\"\n\nCNN's Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

What we know about the weather conditions", "body": "Multiple tornadoes touched down in Iowa on Tuesday night and devastated communities across the state. Wednesday, Iowans are assessing the damage and beginning to clean up.\n\nHere's what we know about the storm system that swept across the Midwest.\n\nIowa tornado map: Where did tornadoes reported in Iowa on Tuesday?\n\nNo tornadoes will officially be confirmed until the National Weather Service is able to send survey crews out into Iowa. On social media, the Des Moines office said three survey teams will be in the field on Wednesday. The National Weather Service in Omaha is also sending teams into southwest Iowa to complete surveys.\n\nUnofficial reports from trained weather spotters throughout Tuesday included: A cluster of sightings in southwest Iowa in Cromwell, Prescott, Corning, Carbon, Red Oak and Villisca. Greenfield in southwest Iowa appeared to be a particularly hard hit. In central Iowa there were unconfirmed reports in Nevada, rural Story County and southeast of Polk City.\n\nUpdates: Tornado, storm damage still being felt in Iowa as clean up begins\n\nWhat caused the storm system that produced deadly tornadoes in Iowa?\n\nA surface low-pressure system swept across the Midwest on Tuesday, triggering multiple storm formations, said Allan Curtis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines.\n\nThat's not what made the system, unusual, though. The dangerous storms were driven by the way all of the \"ingredients\" lined up on Tuesday, he said.\n\nMore details: How do tornadoes form? Explaining the severe weather after dozens of recent Iowa tornadoes\n\n\"[We need] cold fronts, moisture and humidity. We had some sunshine that kind of helped give things more energy,\" Curtis said. \"A big part and this is a little less intuitive for the public, we also look up into the atmosphere. We need some strong winds up there to kind of help keep those kind of storms going.\"\n\nThese types of storm systems are easy to spot in advance, Curtis said. By Monday, NWS meteorologists were forecasting an enhanced (Level 3) risk for severe weather, and began alerting the public via radio, online updates and social media. That increased to a moderate risk (Level 4) by Tuesday morning, hours before deadly storms hit the state.\n\nMore: What is a PDS watch? Understanding the label that describes 'rare situations' for tornadoes\n\nWhen did severe weather enter Iowa on Tuesday?\n\nAn early wave of severe thunderstorms entered the state late Monday night and early Tuesday morning. A few severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued in southwest Iowa shortly after midnight.\n\nAs forecast, another round of severe storms developed in Nebraska in the afternoon, bringing the most dangerous storms to Iowa, Curtis said.\n\nBy 1:30 p.m. storms had crossed the Mississippi River into southwest Iowa, he said. Tornadoes were seen on the ground soon after in places like Prescott and Corning.\n\nGreenfield, where storms were particularly severe, had tornadoes on the ground by 3:30 p.m. Around 4:50 p.m., severe weather had crossed the Des Moines metro and a damaging tornado touched down near Nevada in Story County. The storm was fast-moving, as it exited the state by 7 p.m.\n\nWhat damage assessments do we have for Tuesday's Iowa tornadoes?\n\nNWS Des Moines currently has teams out in the field doing damage assessment, Curtis said. One is stationed near Story County, another team is dedicated to Greenfield and the final is near Adams County.\n\n\"The focus right now is just trying to get that assessment done but also be out of the way for [the community] to do their recovery,\" Curtis said.\n\nNWS says Iowa tornadoes highlight the importance of being weather aware\n\nThis spring has been active for storm systems, but Curtis said that isn't stopping anytime soon, we aren't out of severe weather season, \"by any stretch.\"", "source": {"uri": "press-citizen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iowa City Press-Citizen"},

Alex Dinkla told CNN.\n\nHowever, he did not give an exact number or any details regarding the fatalities.\n\n\"There is basically nothing left,\" said Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative

Authorities have yet to release the number of fatalities.\n\nThe tornado was so powerful it blew debris 40,000 feet into the air, with people several miles away finding wreckage in their yards.\n\n\"This town has a long road ahead of them, but if their actions today are any indication of what lies ahead, they will emerge stronger and more united than ever before,\" Sgt Dinkla said.\n\nThe tornado brought extensive damage to the small town.\n\nFormer state representative Clel Baudler, who resides near Greenfield, told The Des Moines Register that officials are now focused on rescue efforts.\n\n\"Ambulances are running north and south like crazy,\" Mr Baudler said. \"It's all rescue and recovery right now.\"\n\nResident Carl Faust said he and his wife took shelter in their home as the tornado wrecked their town.\n\n\"I got down five steps to the basement, and the house started popping,\" Mr Faust told The Des Moines Register.\n\nThe Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, said on Tuesday she is \"committed to providing the full resources of the state to support the response and recovery effort\".\n\nSome 1,400 people in Adair County, which houses Greenfield, are without power as of Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 32 other tornadoes spawned in the state on Tuesday. Almost all the tornadoes hit central and western Iowa, within 50 miles of the state capital Des Moines, reports local outlet Fox 9.\n\nIowans will see a reprieve on Wednesday as the severe weather begins to subside. Central Iowa is under a hazardous weather outlook warning for non-severe thunderstorms, while some counties are under flood warnings.\n\nHowever, severe thunderstorms are now threatening much of eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nThese storms will bring the possibility for large hail, damaging wind gusts and tornadoes in the region, the NWS warns. Heavy rainfall may also contribute to flooding. Severe weather will peak on Wednesday afternoon in Oklahoma and Arkansas, while eastern Texas should be on alert through 1am on Thursday.\n\nSevere thunderstorms in Texas will continue on Thursday, the NWS says.\n\nOn Monday, Kansas also saw significant damage as a brutal storm passed through the state. Power lines were downed, and homes, businesses and vehicles were damaged as heavy gusts of winds tore through Russell County, officials said.\n\nSeven people also died in Houston, Texas, last week after severe weather hit the region. Residents now find themselves grappling with extreme heat amid widespread power outages.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alex Dinkla said in a news conference that at least 12 people were treated in hospitals -- although the town's Adair County Memorial Hospital was also damaged, forcing first responders to take victims to facilities elsewhere.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to move away from the Midwest and toward the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said, with large hail, wind damage and tornadoes likely across Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.\n\nAerial footage from Greenfield, Iowa, shot late Tuesday showed entire streets that were in the path of the tornado turned to wreckage, with piles of debris among broken trees and demolished cars.\n\nA man in nearby Red Oak, Montgomery County, captured footage of an enormous funnel cloud moving through the area as sirens wailed and intense rain fell.\n\nMontgomery County Emergency Management said in a statement that multiple confirmed tornadoes damaged at least 28 homes, with the damage ranging from \"affected to destroyed.\"\n\nWind turbines were left in ruin near Prescott, Iowa. And the wind was strong enough near the town of Nevada, Iowa, to topple a semi-truck which had stopped on a highway due to the extreme conditions. There has been no report of related casualties.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds declared a disaster in 15 counties and was due to visit the area on Wednesday.\n\nThe situation is so severe in Iowa that the NWS said it would deploy three teams from its Des Moines office to survey the tornado damage, with the results expected Wednesday night.\n\nElsewhere, in Colorado large hailstones stripped the cladding from buildings and shattering car windows -- NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver reported that the hail was at times baseball-sized.\n\nIn Omaha, Nebraska, cars were swept away by raging flood waters caused by between 4 and 8 inches of rain, leaving some stranded.\n\nNBC affiliate WOWT of Omaha spoke to local man Mike Troy, a school football coach, whose home was on a newly-created island. The water was not considered deep enough to justify a rescue, he said.\n\nMore than 70,000 energy customers were still without power in Texas after a torrid few days of severe weather as of 6 a.m. ET,

Biden to approve a disaster declaration in order to get federal assistance for state residents.\n\nAmong the buildings damaged in Greenfield was a hospital, forcing authorities to create a makeshift medical care center at the lumberyard and send some of the injured to other area facilities.\n\nState Representative Ray Sorensen said several residents used their own vehicles to transport those who were injured to safety moments after the storm struck.\n\n\"We pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher we made and threw him in the back of a truck,\" he

I'm just praying that everyone was safe, that everybody's safe, and nobody got hurt,\" Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, said in a KCCI interview, standing near some of the demolished dwellings. \"It was scary, very scary.\"\n\nKCCI reported the damage to Greenfield was apparently caused by a tornado.\n\nOther video showed smashed vehicles and heavy damage to a gasoline station in Greenfield, the county seat of Adair County, which along with adjacent Adams County appeared to have borne the brunt of the Iowa storms in the southwestern corner of the state.\n\nKCCI reported that Adair County Hospital in Greenfield was damaged and was evacuated, citing a hospital spokesperson.\n\nAt least one person, a woman in Adams County, was listed as a storm-related fatality, the county's medical examiner Lisa Brown said. She spoke to Reuters by phone but said she could not yet provide more details.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds declared a \"disaster emergency\" for 15 counties, including Adair and Adams, allowing state resources to be readily utilized in responding to the storm.\n\nAlso in Adams County, at least three wind turbines standing about 25 stories high were nearly snapped in half, with one catching fire, KCCI reported. It said several other wind turbines were damaged in Adair County.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm advisories for much of Iowa and several other Midwestern states on Tuesday, including parts of Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nEarlier in the day, the weather service confirmed at least one tornado over Rollingstone, Minnesota.\n\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Sonali Paul)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

Back in southwest Iowa, it appears Greenfield was hit by a large tornado, but Small says they don't know yet how big it may've been.\n\nMore storms are in the immediate forecast, but Small says they don't appear to be threatening.\n\nThis latest round of severe weather follows several bouts with tornadoes during April, which saw 43 tornadoes during the month, the fourth-highest number ever recorded in a single month in Iowa.", "source": {"uri": "kiow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mix 107.3 KIOW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnston High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://kiow.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bigstock-A-Thin-Cone-Tornado-Spins-Over-306473911-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Luckily, no one was hurt.\" Ray was at his desk at about 3:30 p.m. when the tornado hit.\n\n\"All of the windows busted out,\" he said. \"I closed my eyes and covered my head. It seemed like it lasted forever.\"\n\nEldon Ray was sitting at his desk when the tornado hit, devastating Schildberg Construction Co.'s Greenfield, Iowa, office.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Eldon Ray\n\nThe day after the tornado, Ray said the company was salvaging what they could and working from other of their office locations while hoping to be back in business within about a week.\n\nHe said wind turbines, owned by Des Moines-based MidAmerican Energy Co., also were destroyed. \"I drove by them and for seven or eight miles they were bent over, completely flat,\" he said.\n\nTina Hoffman, MidAmerican Energy's vice president of corporate communications, confirmed that the tornado struck two of its wind farms in Adair County.\n\n\"A tornado struck and collapsed five wind turbines at MidAmerican's Orient wind farm and one at the Arbor Hill wind farm,\" she said in a statement. \"Several turbines registered wind speeds over 100 mph as the tornado approached, before we lost contact with our sensors and the turbines were destroyed.\"\n\nShe said the company, which has operated wind farms since 2004, has previously lost only one other wind turbine, also due to a tornado.\n\nShe said manufacturers design the turbines to withstand severe thunderstorms and high wind events, \"but, as we've seen from the damage sustained throughout several Iowa counties, few structures can withstand a direct hit by a powerful tornado such as what we experienced on Tuesday,\" she said.\n\nThe company is inspecting all of its wind facilities in areas affected by the tornado before resuming operations, she saiid. Wind technicians took cover and were not injured during the storm, she said.\n\nSgt. Alex Dinkla, the Iowa State Patrol public information officer, confirmed there were fatalities and injuries resulting from the storm, but didn't specify numbers because it is still considered a search-and-rescue effort.\n\nGov.

As of Wednesday morning, the authorities were still unable to provide a definitive estimate of the number of fatalities, in spite of the fact that they had stated that they did not wish to reveal a number until they were positive.\n\nWorkers in the small city, which had a population of 2,000 people, were still sorting through trash on Wednesday. This harsh weather caused injuries to at least twelve people, according to officials that responded to the situation. As far as the National Weather Service is concerned,\n\nHowever, they assert that the evaluation is still in progress and that there is a possibility that things will shift in the days to come. Tornadoes with winds of 136 to 165 miles per hour are classified as EF-3 tornadoes.\n\nResidents in the area have been relocated to shelters as a result of the damage that occurred to the local hospital. Additionally, a nearby school has been transformed into a temporary hospital. During the previous evening, the authorities had been using a lumberyard as a center for triage.\n\nAs per the findings of the FOX Weather Storm Tracker Brandon Copic, the majority of the village has been completely obliterated, according to his assessments of the situation. It has been largely decimated in this town. There is no other way to express this feeling than by the way it is expressed. In most of this town, there is a sense of desolation.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) Facility, which is located east of Greenfield, is accepting donations of food and water from anyone who wishes to show their support for the community they are a part of. For your convenience,\n\nIn addition to Greenfield, the National Weather Service in Des Moines received reports of tornadoes from Macksburg, Winterset, Norwalk, Alleman, Cambridge, Nevada, and Pleasant Hill during the late afternoon.\n\nThese reports were received from a variety of locations. The majority of these regions are located to the west of Des Moines, and each of them is within fifty miles of the city.\n\nA tornado that was approaching Carbon, Iowa, which is located around 60 miles east of Omaha, was captured on camera by FOX Weather earlier in the day. These allegations are in addition to the ones that have already been described. Another video shows what appears to be a tornado in the Red Oak, Iowa region. The tornado was captured on surveillance footage.\n\nAn further video was uploaded by a professional weather chaser that showed a tornado causing damage to a windmill in the vicinity of Williamson, which is around 40 miles from the border with Missouri.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n'Kate Middleton Is Back At Work,' Kensington Palace Announces", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Alex Dinkla confirmed the tornado caused \"fatalities and injuries within the community of Greenfield,\" but did not offer specific numbers, according to a news release from the Iowa Department of Public Safety.\n\nAmong those killed are an unidentified couple and a third individual, according to The Weather Channel. Cynthia Jenson, a cousin of one of the victims, said she knew all three individuals.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking,\" Jenson told the station while describing the damage she witnessed. \"I mean, there are houses that are gone that you always saw. You knew the landmarks in town to get to where you needed to go. So yeah, it's awful.\"\n\nDrone footage captured by professional storm chasers Reed Timmer and Mike Scantlin showed the massive twister barrelling through the small town.\n\nSeveral wind turbines were knocked down by the twister, which storm chasers also filmed.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe Adair County Memorial Hospital sustained damage as well, though teams still \"worked swiftly to assist the injured,\" according to Dinkla.\n\nThe Greenfield Community School District is serving as both a reunification point and a temporary shelter following the storm, according to the sergeant.\n\n\"This town has a long road ahead of them, but if their actions today are any indication of what lies ahead, they will emerge stronger and more united than ever before,\" Dinkla told reporters Tuesday evening.\n\nA food and water donation site has been established at the Department of Transportation (DOT) Facility at 2313 Highway 92, Dinkla added.\n\n\"The community of Greenfield has shown incredible unity during this challenging time, with neighbors and friends displaying remarkable compassion, empathy, and support,\" Dinkla said at Tuesday's press conference.\n\nAt least 20 tornadoes touched down across the Midwest on Tuesday, according to ABC News. At least 18 twisters were recorded in Iowa, CNN reported.\n\nTornadoes have been ravaging the Midwest and Southern states since March, and more are expected on Wednesday. This time, the highest risk for twisters is in portions of central and eastern Texas, southwest Arkansas and northwest Louisiana, according to the NWS Storm Prediction Center.", "source": {"uri":

At least one person, a woman in nearby Adams County, was killed in the storms, the county's medical examiner said.\n\nReynolds said state officials were working to send a request for President Joe Biden to approve a disaster declaration in order to get federal assistance for state residents.\n\nAmong the buildings damaged in Greenfield was a hospital, forcing authorities to create a makeshift medical care center at the lumberyard and send some of the injured to other area facilities.\n\nState Representative Ray Sorensen said several residents used their own vehicles to transport those who were injured to safety moments after the storm struck.\n\n\"We pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher we made and threw him in the back of a truck,\" he said.\n\nTornadoes along with severe storms packing large hail and damaging winds were likely again on Wednesday across the Southern Plains as well as Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, the National Weather Service warned.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The city is collecting monetary donations and looking for equipment to help aid in the town's recovery.\n\nMultiple fatalities and at least a dozen injuries have been reported in Greenfield. It's not yet known how strong the tornado was or the full extent of the damage. But, much of the town of about 2,000 people has been damaged.\n\nBefore you offer a hand to Greenfield, the best thing you can do is follow the procedure. Here's how you can help Greenfield, Iowa, in the aftermath of the tornado.\n\nThe Adair Sheriff's Department said in a Facebook post in the early hours of Wednesday morning that access to Greenfield must be limited to ensure aid can enter the town. Anyone trying to enter the town must provide identification and nonresidents may be turned away.\n\n\"In speaking with those who responded to the tornado that struck towns in western Iowa earlier this spring, these steps are needed to prevent a tremendous amount of nonessential people from slowing down the progress of those who are essential to clean up, especially utility crews trying to restore power to the city,\" according to the Facebook post.\n\nThere are state troopers at most entrances to Greenfield. The emergency proclmation also imposes a curfew for the city between 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. After those hours, you will need identification to prove you are essential help.\n\nMore: Where is Greenfield, Iowa? Here's what we know about the deadly tornado\n\nBefore you can help on the grounds in Greenfield, you must be credentialed to easily enter city limits, according to the Adair Sheriff's Office.\n\nVisit the Iowa DOT Maintenance shed at 2313 State Highway 92, just east of Greenfield, for credentialing. The process began at 9 a.m. Wednesday. A large red Hy-Vee semi-trailer is expected to be the hub for credentialing, according to the Adair County Sheriff's Department.\n\nOnce you approach a checkpoint, you will need identification showing a Greenfield address or a specific location you are going to help. Be prepared to call someone at the address to verify where you are going, according to the Adair County Sheriff's Office.\n\nUpdates: Tornado, storm damage still being felt in Iowa as clean up begins\n\nThe Adair County Sheriff's Office asked anyone willing to lend manpower or equipment for cleanup efforts to comment their contact information on a Facebook post made by the department on Tuesday. The department asked that volunteers refrain from calling the dispatch number because lines are busy.\n\nAnyone who doesn't want their direct number on the Facebook post can directly message the sheriff's office Facebook page, according to the post.\n\nThere is a community shelter in Greenfield at the Nodaway Valley Community High School at 410 NW. 2nd St. The American Red Cross sent a trailer of supplies including water and blankets Tuesday evening.\n\nIowa's American Red Cross Division posted to their Facebook that the agency is actively working with local emergency management in impacted areas from the severe weather on Tuesday. The American Red Cross is supporting the independent community shelter, according to the social media post.\n\nThe aid organization is still assessing the needs of the community to determine how to help.\n\nFNB Bank and Union State Bank, two local banks in Greenfield, are accepting monetary donations for tornado damage from Tuesday.\n\nDonations can also be made to Greenfield's foundation at greenfieldiafoundation.org.\n\nThe Red Cross is also accepting donations at redcross.org/ia.\n\nThe red cross has a hotline for anyone in need of assistance from the severe weather, according to the organizations Facebook post.\n\nYou can call 1-800-RED-CROSS or 1-800-733-2767.\n\n\"We will continue to prove comfort and support to our fellow Iowans in the coming days and weeks,\" the Red Cross Facebook post stated.\n\nKate Kealey is a general assignment reporter for the Register.

In the clip, which spread widely across the social platform X, a semi truck can be seen slowing to a stop along the highway, just yards from a tornado so massive that it appears as just a gray blur.\n\nMoments later, a tanker truck cruises by the stopped tractor-trailer, only to slam on its brakes as the driver apparently realizes - too late - that the tanker is headed for a giant tornado.\n\nThe red brake lights soon disappear, swallowed up by the dark whirling storm that quickly blows the stopped truck over onto its side before engulfing the camera's entire field of view.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what happened to the trucks. Photos posted on X showed a tanker that appeared to match the one in the video; the vehicle had come to rest still upright off the side of the highway.\n\nThere was no word about the status of the driver, but as of Wednesday morning, the only deaths from the storm were being reported in the towns of Corning and Greenfield, which are about 100 miles southwest of Nevada. Several injuries were reported, however.\n\nThe town of Greenfield, Iowa took a direct hit as severe weather ripped across the Midwest.\n\n\"It's not good.

Alex Dinkla of the Iowa State Patrol said at a news conference Tuesday night.\n\nThe Adair County Memorial Hospital team, which serves Greenfield, sustained tornado damage, Dinkla said, but still managed to treat patients and transport some to nearby hospitals for further care.\n\nSearch efforts were underway Tuesday night, with officials working to provide a clear and accurate count of those affected, the officer said.\n\n\"We believe we have everyone accounted for, but we are conducting extensive searches to be thorough,\" he said.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued tornado watches for parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Kansas and Oklahoma through Tuesday night.\n\nNearly the entire state of Iowa was under a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation,\" according to the National Weather Service, which issued several tornado warnings.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties across the state.\n\nThe counties include Adair, Adams, Cass, Clay, Hardin, Harrison, Jasper, Kossuth, Marshall, Montgomery, Page, Palo Alto, Pottawattamie, Tama and Warren.\n\nSeveral videos obtained by ABC affiliate station WOI-TV in Des Moines, captured a large funnel cloud on the ground in Greenfield.\n\nOn Tuesday, WOI reporter Dana Searles, surveying the damage in Des Moines, said, \"This small community has a big chunk destroyed, but about half of it is still intact. From what I've seen, I'd estimate that maybe 75% of it is near to the ground right now.\"\n\nDamaging winds of 70 to 90 mph were forecast for Des Moines, Chicago and Milwaukee from Tuesday afternoon and into the evening.\n\nSevere weather is in full swing across the Great Plains and the Midwest, with more than 100 severe storms reported Monday from Colorado to Michigan.\n\nAt least three tornadoes were reported Monday in Minnesota, Nebraska, and Colorado, but there was no significant damage.\n\nIn Yuma, in northeast Colorado, hail ranging from golf ball to softball size pummeled the area, causing damage to cars and buildings. At one point, the hail was so deep it caused multiple vehicles to get stuck, JJ Unger, a volunteer Yuma firefighter, told ABC News Tuesday.\n\n\"It was like a blizzard hitting for a half hour because of the hail,\" Unger said. \"That's the longest I've seen it hail like that.\"\n\nUnger said he and his fire crew were out spotting for possible tornadoes Monday evening when lightning struck, and hail began to pour.\n\n\"It was very intense,\" said Unger, adding that he and his crew had to pull over and seek shelter as visibility went to almost zero.\n\nUnger said that when the hail finally let up, a foot of hail was covering his fire engine and roads in the area.\n\nHe said the windshields of his pickup truck and his wife's vehicle were shattered.\n\n\"Almost every home in town has broken windows and I've heard that over a thousand cars were damaged,\" Unger said.\n\nIn Nebraska, hail measuring two inches in diameter fell in Dundy County in the southwest corner of the state, according to local emergency management officials. Winds of over 90 mph were also reported in Dundy County.\n\nAs severe weather is expected through Thursday across the Great Plains and Midwest, potential record heat is moving into Texas and the Northeast.\n\nTemperatures could flirt with 90 degrees in Philadelphia, New York City and Washington, D.C., by the middle of this week.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news",

The National Weather Service warns of a \"long swath of severe weather potential\" that spans over a dozen states.\n\nOn Tuesday, the worst storms pummeled Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. But on Wednesday, the greatest concern lay elsewhere.\n\n\"The severe threat today has stretched out across more of the country today with the focus of the nastiest storms moving south across parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas,\" said Nexstar meteorologist Brian James.\n\nWhat can happen if you park under an overpass during a tornado\n\nA National Weather Service forecast map (below) showed the possibility of severe weather as far north as New York.\n\n\"Damaging winds and large hail will be the main threats for most of those impacted by the stronger storms. A few tornadoes will also be possible, mainly across parts of Texas,\" said James.\n\nTornado watches were already in effect for parts of Texas by mid-day Wednesday.\n\nThe deadly twister that killed at least one person near Greenfield, Iowa, on Tuesday came amid a historically bad season for tornadoes in the U.S. at a time when climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world. April had the second highest number of tornadoes on record in the U.S.\n\nThese are the best places to live in the US: 2024 report\n\nThrough Tuesday, there had been 27% more tornadoes in the country than average. The preliminary count for this year of 859 is the highest since 2017 and is significantly more than the average of 676 through May 21, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Nearly 700 of the tornadoes have been in April and May.\n\nIowa has had the most tornadoes this year with 81, followed by Texas with 74 and Kansas and Ohio each with 66. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa -- including the one in Greenfield -- and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

There's widespread destruction in the Adair County town, with homes leveled, cars tossed and trees stripped bare.\n\nMeteorologist Brad Small, at the National Weather Service in metro Des Moines, says it's still unclear just how many tornadoes hit the state on Tuesday afternoon. \"Present indications are right now, there were at least six,\" Small says, \"but we'll send surveys teams out today which will try to hone that number down a little closer.\"\n\nThose weather service teams will focus on three primary areas of the state where the tornadoes did their worst.\n\n\"One will be near Corning in southwest Iowa, and then also up toward Greenfield, which was obviously the most impacted location in the state,\" Small says, \"and then we also appear to have had a tornado in northern Polk County, possibly starting up by Saylorville Lake or northern Johnston and that tracked into Story County.\"\n\nThat tornado damaged Johnston High School, which is closed at least for today. Back in southwest Iowa, it appears Greenfield was hit by a large tornado, but Small says they don't know yet how big it may've been.\n\n\"We'll be able to provide more details on that later in the day today, looking at some aerial photography, drone imagery and of course, get on the ground and look at the damage up close and provide the rating,\" Small says. \"Remember, the tornado ratings are damage ratings, so it's not visually what the tornado looked like. It's strictly based on the damage that occurred.\"\n\nMore storms are in the immediate forecast, but Small says they don't appear to be threatening.\n\n\"Possibly some light showers, maybe a rumble of thunder today, but nothing significant today, and Thursday during the day looks dry, but Thursday night and Friday, the chances for showers and thunderstorms are back in the forecast,\" Small says. \"The severe weather potential doesn't look too great at this time.

With the hospital damaged, a medical triage center started at the local lumberyard. Paramedics and police officers from across the western half of Iowa were speeding in to help.\n\n\"Everybody became little makeshift ambulances,\" said Ray Sorensen, a member of the Iowa House of Representatives who lives in Greenfield, and who said he helped with the rescues after racing back into town shortly after the storm hit on Tuesday afternoon. \"We pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made, threw him in the back of a truck.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the roughly 2,000 residents of Greenfield began to get a clearer look at the destruction all around. Gov. Kim Reynolds said some areas had been \"flattened into debris.\" Officials said multiple people in town died and more were injured, but had not yet said how many as search and rescue efforts continued. In nearby Adams County, one woman died from storm-related causes, according to the medical examiner.\n\nAround Greenfield, the scenes of destruction began abruptly, with lush green yards transitioning into the chaos of splintered lumber and lawns littered with household items -- a cooler, a sink. Outside the local hospital, shredded tree branches were scattered across a lawn and a board had shattered the window of a parked car.\n\nAs rescue crews sorted through the wreckage, residents were beginning to reflect on a proud community that was indelibly changed.\n\n\"It's just the skyline of the trees: there's so many old historic trees in town that are gone,\" Mr. Sorensen said. He added: \"It's a completely different town now.\"\n\nIt has been a particularly brutal spring in Iowa, which is still recovering from an outbreak of tornadoes last month that caused extensive damage in the small town called Minden, about 70 miles from Greenfield.\n\n\"I was just in Minden,\" Ms. Reynolds said at a news conference on Wednesday, \"and that was horrific.

At least three people were reported killed by local authorities.\n\nA series of large, violent tornadoes struck Iowa on Tuesday, causing significant destruction and fatalities in some rural communities.\n\nPortions of Iowa, northwestern Illinois, southeastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin were placed under a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation\" Tornado Watch as rounds of powerful storms raced across the region, continuing a dayslong severe weather threat across the U.S.\n\nLess than 5% of all severe weather watches are given the Particularly Dangerous Situation tag, which signified forecasters' concerns about the outbreak.\n\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n\nSeveral deaths were attributed to the severe weather outbreak centered southwest of the state capital of Des Moines.\n\nWATCH: WIND TURBINE BURNS IN IOWA AFTER BEING DESTROYED BY TORNADO\n\nThe FOX Forecast Center spotted debris on radar from two twisters that impacted Carbon and Corning, and debris was being reported thrown at least 15 miles from a tornado that impacted Greenfield, Iowa.\n\nGreenfield, located in Adair County, has a population of around 2,000 people and is at the heart of the county.\n\nVideo showed people searching through rubble from what was a large tornado. Due to the powerful display on radar, forecasters believe the twister was on the upper half of the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\n\nDamage appeared to be significant on the southern and eastern sides of Greenfield, around the region's medical center.\n\n\"Most of this town is gone ... there's no other way to put it. Most of this town is gone,\" FOX Weather Exclusive Storm Tracker Brandon Copic said.\n\nPowerOutage.us reported more than half of Adair County was without power following the severe storms.\n\nDRONE VIDEO REVEALS DEVASTATION IN GREENFIELD AFTER MONSTER IOWA TORNADO: 'MOST OF THIS TOWN IS GONE'\n\nRoads into and out of Greenfield were blocked by first responders in the hours after the severe weather to keep nonresidents out of the community.\n\n\"So it came up pretty quickly. The storm was moving at 50 to 55 miles an hour. So they're coming in quickly. People had a decent warning ... and, thankfully, 99% of the people that we had talked to had a good reaction to that warning and took shelter,\" Copic said.\n\nValerie Warrior is a lifelong Iowa resident and said one of the first signs trouble was on the way to Greenfield on Tuesday was when she started receiving texts from her family members.\n\n\"So, I went downstairs, got my cat and I went into the furnace room. I was holding my cat for my whole life, and I was shaking, and I heard the train,\" Warrior told FOX Weather.\n\nWarrior said the storm lasted only about a minute, but during that time period, windows broke, trees fell, and the small town was changed forever.\n\n\"There's houses down and flattened next to me and all over the place. My house got hurt. It got some damage to the roof, with the front porch, windows are out, and the back garage got a hole in the roof, but nothing compared to the devastation all over town,\" said Warrior.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Des Moines will survey damage over the next couple of days to determine the strength of the twisters.", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The once familiar town was now unrecognizable.\n\nSoon after the storm passed, photographer Chris Juhn captured 6-year-old Hudson Vanatta sitting on the steps of a home that no longer exists. The boy's father is a firefighter who responded to the call for help, despite their own situation in the wake of the disaster.\n\nDRONE VIDEO REVEALS DEVASTATION IN GREENFIELD AFTER MONSTER IOWA TORNADO: 'MOST OF THIS TOWN IS GONE'\n\nAnother striking image by Juhn shows a house with its front gone, yet inside, pictures still hang on the walls, a small plant and other items remain untouched on a dresser, and binders and books sit inside a bookshelf.\n\nTragically, the storm claimed the lives of at least two individuals, and a dozen more suffered injuries, adding to the immense toll of the disaster.\n\nAdair County Memorial Hospital was also damaged in the tornado. Doctors and hospital staff worked to help the injured. However, due to the damage to the hospital, patients needing further care had to be transferred to surrounding hospitals.\n\nAlong the tornado's path, houses were reduced to rubble, and the once lush trees stood bare, stripped of their leaves and bark. FOX Weather radar data showed that the debris was propelled to an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, equivalent to the typical cruising altitude for commercial airplanes.\n\nAnother chaotic scene unfolded southwest of Greenfield as numerous wind turbines collapsed, resulting in the large metal structures crumpling like paper. One of the turbines even caught fire, adding to the dramatic scene.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service will dispatch three damage survey teams in response to the severe weather in Iowa. Governor Kim Reynolds is also scheduled to visit Greenfield to assess the extent of the damage personally.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_oberholtz@foxweather.com", "name": "Chris Oberholtz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_land", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield land"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hudson County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hudson County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/Greenfield-Tornado-32.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588360", "eventUri": "eng-9588360", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The governor is hoping to have damage estimates completed by tomorrow so she can submit a request for a presidential disaster declaration that would trigger federal aid.\n\n\"We're going to file for individual assistance again and public assistance,\" Reynolds said during a news conference htis morning in Greenfield. \"The hospital was damaged and so we want to make sure that we're providing resources for them as well.\"\n\nThe governor told reporters four injured people were flown out of Greenfield on helicopters to area hospitals last (Tuesday) night, but she cannot confirm the number of people who were killed or injured.\n\n\"It's still a search and rescue and we don't want to give out any misinformation. That's one of the reasons we're keeping the site secure,\" Reynolds said. \"...We wouldn't want to give out a wrong number and we're still assessing and there are properties in the country that have been impacted as well so we want to make sure we have an accurate count.\"\n\nThere's a 10 a.m. to 7 a.m. curfew in Greenfield and people have to show proof they have a Greenfield address in order to enter the community. John Cooper, Adair County's Emergency Management Coordinator, said that's an element of their \"coordinated search\" to confirm injuries and deaths in the community.\n\n\"When we have this many homes that have been destroyed and just fully demolished, we want to make sure every person, every resident is accounted for,\" Cooper told reporters. \"We're going to continue doing that and then encountered for, so we're going to continue doing that and then, once we have those numbers, we'll send that information out.\"\n\nReynolds said it appears the damage in Greenfield is worse than what she saw Minden, where 40% of homes were damaged or destroyed by a tornado last month. \"It's just gut wrenching,\" Reynolds said. \"I was just in Minden...three and a half weeks ago and that was horrific and I think there's even more debris and more impacted here. It is is horrific. It is hard to describe, until you can see it, the devastation.\"\n\nReynolds praised the work of meteorologists at the National Weather Service for advance notice of yesterday's (Tuesday's) dangerous conditions.\n\n\"Letting individuals know when it would hit and where it would hit and they were almost spot on,\" Reynolds said. \"And I tell ya the other reason that was so important...we had a lot of kids still in school and based on the early, advance notice that we got, many of our schools let out early and it hit here (in Greenfield) at three and that would have been the time the kids were on a bus and headed home and it could have been devastating.\"\n\nReynolds also thanked Greenfield's hospital staff for their response to the tornado after it damaged their facility. They established a make-shift triage center at Greenfield's lumber yard to treat people who were injured and set up the transfers for people who needed treatment in a hospital. The state education director has issued a waiver, so the district's school year is officially over.

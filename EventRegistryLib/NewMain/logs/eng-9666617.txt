Is this Syria? Is this Iraq?\" It then displays Muslims at prayer accompanied by a text that says: \"Wake up Canada. You are under siege.\"\n\nThe outside of the van has \"Is this Lebanon?\" written on the vehicle's back and side.\n\n\"This is extremely dangerous messaging and should not be condoned,\" the National Council of Canadian Muslims posted on X. \"We have seen Islamophobic hate kill in Canada, including in Ontario.\"\n\nAmira Elghawaby, Canada's special representative on combatting Islamophobia, told CTV News that the incident has engendered fear in the Muslim community, given the history of past violence.\n\n\"We have really been on edge when it comes to hate targeting our communities, and this is just one more example of why people are really worried,\" she said. \"We do not want to see another Quebec Mosque massacre or a London family attack.\"\n\nIn January 2017, a man gunned down six Muslims and wounded 19 while they were at prayer in the Islamic Cultural Centre in Quebec City. On June 6, 2021 in London, Ontario, a driver rammed his pickup truck into a Muslim family of five, killing four of them.\n\nAnti-Muslim and antisemitic hate speech online has increased by 500%, with a dramatic jump since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7 last year, Elghawaby noted.\n\nThe Toronto Police Hate Crime Unit posted on X that \"we recognize the community's concern\" and asked

Levant would not divulge the identity of anyone behind the group, nor confirm if it is based in Toronto.\n\n\"They're worried about violence and they have every right to be,\" he said.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday, Toronto police said the force's hate crime unit is investigating the truck.\n\n\"We recognize the community's concern about a truck displaying Islamophobic messaging in Toronto,\" the post reads.\n\nInvestigators are asking anyone with information about the truck, or people who have seen it or have video footage or pictures of it, to contact police or Crime Stoppers.\n\nIn a post on Rebel News's website, Levant confirmed police are investigating and also pointed readers to a fundraising page set up for the truck and \"to help me pay for our lawyer to fight this police investigation.\"\n\nIn videos posted to social media, video screens on the truck appear to display a series of questions that say: \"Is this Lebanon? Is this Yemen? Is this Syria? Is this Iraq?\"\n\nThe truck then displays images of what appears to be Muslims praying and protesting in Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto. Palestinian flags and the square's concrete arches are visible in the images.\n\nThe messages on the truck then say: \"No. This is Canada. Wake up Canada. You are under siege.\"\n\nSpeaking with CBC News, Levant pointed to regular protests organized by pro-Palestinian groups in Toronto over the last several months, alongside shots being fired at a Jewish school last month -- which he said happened under the \"sleepy gaze\" of Toronto police.\n\n\"But the moment a community group that's concerned about this has a peaceful, critical ad on a billboard truck, the Toronto police jumps to attention and calls their peaceful political viewpoint a hate crime,\" he said.\n\n\"It's obviously not, this is cancel culture being enforced by the Toronto police. They'll obviously lose in court, but it shows the kind of two-tier policing we have.\"\n\nBarbara Perry, director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism told CBC News in an interview that even if Rebel News didn't create the ad, the organization still has a responsibility for the imagery displayed on its truck.\n\n\"I think with [the advocacy group's] title, you can guess what kind of messaging that they are going to be advertising on their vehicles,\" Perry said.\n\nSpeaking at an unrelated news conference Thursday, Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said she has asked other levels of government to join her in condemning the truck's \"very hateful message.\"\n\n\"Toronto is a city where everyone belongs. Prayers are welcome, whether you want to pray in a synagogue, a mosque or a church -- or in a local park or community centre. It's your freedom to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"Islamophobia has no place in this city. Neither does hate and divisiveness.\"\n\nAdvocates have slammed the truck's messaging as racist.\n\nAmira Elghawaby, Canada's Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, said in an interview Wednesday that she was surprised and disappointed when she heard about the truck and believes it should be widely condemned.\n\n\"This type of messaging really does send quite an unfortunate message of division and hate,\" she said, adding it has no place in Canada.\n\n\"Sadly, Islamophobia and now anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Arab racism, these are not new phenomena. The forms that they can take can differ,\" Elghawaby said. \"What is most alarming, of course, is when they lead to Islamophobic, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab violence.\"\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), a non-profit organization that describes itself as a \"leading voice for Muslim civic engagement,\" said in a post on X Tuesday that the messaging on the truck is designed to incite a fear of Muslims in Canada.\n\n\"This is extremely dangerous messaging, and should not be condoned. We have seen Islamophobic hate kill in Canada, including in Ontario,\" the NCCM said.\n\n\"This public campaign is pure Islamophobia and hate,\" the NCCM said.\n\n\"We are expecting all of our leaders to condemn this form of hate in Toronto.

Is this Syria? Is this Iraq?\" The video then shows images of Muslims praying, followed by text that says \"Wake up Canada. You are under siege.\"\n\n\"What this van was advertising, (is) trying to suggest that Canadian Muslims and communal prayer is something that is threatening and dangerous,\" Amira Elghawaby, the federal government's special representative on combatting Islamophobia, told CTV News. \"We have really been on edge when it comes to hate targeting our communities and this is just one more example of why people are really worried.\"\n\nElghawaby says the message displayed on the truck goes beyond free speech and has stoked fear within the Muslim community.\n\n\"We do not want to see another Quebec mosque massacre or a London family attack,\" she says.\n\nAlghawaby notes that there has been a 500 per cent increase in Islamophobic and antisemitic hate speech online, content that has surged since the attacks of Oct. 7 and the start of the war in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, antisemitic content soared 919 per cent on X (formerly known as Twitter) and 28 per cent on Facebook in the month following Oct. 7. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based advocacy group, says anti-Muslim hate speech on X jumped 422 per cent in the days following the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nCities across Canada are also reporting a rise in alleged hate crimes, including Toronto with nearly 190 incidents reported to Toronto police so far this year. Nearly half of those have been antisemitic.\n\n\"Let's be clear, there is a crisis of antisemitism in this country,\" Richard Marceau, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, told CTV News in an interview. \"Now is the time to act. Words are not enough, it's time for political leaders to actually take action to solve this.\"\n\nMarceau wants police and political leaders to do more to protect members of the Jewish community, including areas around synagogues and schools that have been the subject of violent attacks.\n\nWhen it comes to hate speech, Elghawaby urges Canadians to speak up.\n\n\"Canada's values of pluralism, of diversity, of respect of people of all backgrounds, those values need to be our north star in this moment,\" she says.\n\nIt's not clear who organized and paid for the truck, but Toronto Police confirm they have received a number of reports about it from members of the public and are asking anyone with pictures or videos of the truck, to come forward.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca",

Levant would not divulge the identity of anyone behind the group, nor confirm if it is based in Toronto.\n\n\"They're worried about violence and they have every right to be,\" he said.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday, Toronto police said the force's hate crime unit is investigating the truck.\n\n\"We recognize the community's concern about a truck displaying Islamophobic messaging in Toronto,\" the post reads.\n\nInvestigators are asking anyone with information about the truck, or people who have seen it or have video footage or pictures of it, to contact police or Crime Stoppers.\n\nIn a post on Rebel News's website, Levant confirmed police are investigating and also pointed readers to a fundraising page set up for the truck and \"to help me pay for our lawyer to fight this police investigation.\"\n\nIn videos posted to social media, video screens on the truck appear to display a series of questions that say: \"Is this Lebanon? Is this Yemen? Is this Syria? Is this Iraq?\"\n\nThe truck then displays images of what appears to be Muslims praying and protesting in Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto. Palestinian flags and the square's concrete arches are visible in the images.\n\nThe messages on the truck then say: \"No. This is Canada. Wake up Canada. You are under siege.\"\n\nSpeaking with CBC News, Levant pointed to regular protests organized by pro-Palestinians groups in Toronto over the last several months, alongside shots being fired at a Jewish school last month -- which he said happened under the \"sleepy gaze\" of Toronto police.\n\n\"But the moment a community group that's concerned about this has a peaceful, critical ad on a billboard truck, the Toronto police jumps to attention and calls their peaceful political viewpoint a hate crime,\" he said.\n\n\"It's obviously not, this is cancel culture being enforced by the Toronto police. They'll obviously lose in court, but it shows the kind of two-tier policing we have.\"\n\nSpeaking at an unrelated news conference Thursday, Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said she has asked others levels of government to join her in condemning the truck's \"very hateful message.\"\n\n\"Toronto is a city where everyone belongs. Prayers are welcome, whether you want to pray in a synagogue, a mosque or a church -- or in a local park or community centre. It's your freedom to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"Islamophobia has no place in this city. Neither does hate and divisiveness.\"\n\nAdvocates have slammed the truck's messaging as racist.\n\nAmira Elghawaby, Canada's Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, said in an interview Wednesday that she was surprised and disappointed when she heard about the truck and believes it should be widely condemned.\n\n\"This type of messaging really does send quite an unfortunate message of division and hate,\" she said, adding it has no place in Canada.\n\n\"Sadly, Islamophobia and now anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Arab racism, these are not new phenomena. The forms that they can take can differ,\" Elghawaby said. \"What is most alarming, of course, is when they lead to Islamophobic, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab violence.\"\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), a non-profit organization that describes itself as a \"leading voice for Muslim civic engagement,\" said in a post on X Tuesday that the messaging on the truck is designed to incite a fear of Muslims in Canada.\n\n\"This is extremely dangerous messaging, and should not be condoned. We have seen Islamophobic hate kill in Canada, including in Ontario,\" the NCCM said.\n\n\"This public campaign is pure Islamophobia and hate,\" the NCCM said.\n\n\"We are expecting all of our leaders to condemn this form of hate in Toronto.

Is this Syria? Is this Iraq?\" The video then shows images of Muslims praying, followed by text that says \"Wake up Canada. You are under siege.\"\n\n\"What this van was advertising, (is) trying to suggest that Canadian Muslims and communal prayer is something that is threatening and dangerous,\" Amira Elghawaby, the federal government's special representative on combatting Islamophobia, told CTV News. \"We have really been on edge when it comes to hate targeting our communities and this is just one more example of why people are really worried.\"\n\nElghawaby says the message displayed on the truck goes beyond free speech and has stoked fear within the Muslim community.\n\n\"We do not want to see another Quebec mosque massacre or a London family attack,\" she says.\n\nAlghawaby notes that there has been a 500 per cent increase in Islamophobic and antisemitic hate speech online, content that has surged since the attacks of Oct. 7 and the start of the war in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, antisemitic content soared 919 per cent on X (formerly known as Twitter) and 28 per cent on Facebook in the month following Oct. 7. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based advocacy group, says anti-Muslim hate speech on X jumped 422 per cent in the days following the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nCities across Canada are also reporting a rise in alleged hate crimes, including Toronto with nearly 190 incidents reported to Toronto police so far this year. Nearly half of those have been antisemitic.\n\n\"Let's be clear, there is a crisis of antisemitism in this country,\" Richard Marceau, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, told CTV News in an interview. \"Now is the time to act. Words are not enough, it's time for political leaders to actually take action to solve this.\"\n\nMarceau wants police and political leaders to do more to protect members of the Jewish community, including areas around synagogues and schools that have been the subject of violent attacks.\n\nWhen it comes to hate speech, Elghawaby urges Canadians to speak up.\n\n\"Canada's values of pluralism, of diversity, of respect of people of all backgrounds, those values need to be our north star in this moment,\" she says.\n\nIt's not clear who organized and paid for the truck, but Toronto Police confirm they have received a number of reports about it from members of the public and are asking anyone with pictures or videos of the truck, to come forward.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca",

Is this Syria? Is this Iraq?\" before showing images of people in prayer. \"Wake up Canada. You are under siege,\" it then reads.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service confirmed Wednesday that its Hate Crimes Unit is investigating the incident.\n\nCommunity members and activists have spoken out against its message since the videos surfaced earlier this week. On Wednesday, Canada's Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, Amira Elghawaby, called the incident \"threatening and dangerous.\"\n\nThe messaging goes beyond free speech and has stoked fear within the Muslim community, Elghawaby said. The representative pointed to a 500 per cent increase in Islamophobic and antisemitic online hate speech observed in Canada since Oct. 7 and urged Canadians to speak up in the face of injustice.\n\n\"We have really been on edge when it comes to hate targeting our communities and this is just one more example of why people are really worried,\" Elghawaby said. \"We do not want to see another Quebec mosque massacre or a London family attack.\"\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims also decried the campaign on Tuesday, calling it \"pure Islamophobia.\" It called on leaders to condemn the messaging.\n\nWhen asked about the investigation at an unrelated news conference on Thursday afternoon, Mayor Olivia Chow said Islamophobic sentiments have no place in Toronto.\n\n\"Toronto is a city where everyone belongs. Prayers are welcome, whether you want to pray in a synagogue, a mosque or a church -- or in a local park or community centre. It's your freedom to do so,\" Chow said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Toronto businessman Mohamad Fakih offered a $25,000 reward for information that led to the arrests of those responsible, claiming that politicians and police leadership had failed to act sufficiently.\n\n\"We won't stand for this nonsense here in Toronto,\" he wrote.\n\nPolice said Thursday their investigation remains ongoing.\n\nIn a message posted to social media, Chief Myron Demkiw said that \"hateful behaviour should have no place in Toronto.\"\n\n\"Everyone deserves to feel safe in our great city,\" he said.\n\nAnyone with information is being asked to contact investigators at their local division or submit a tip anonymously to Crime Stoppers.", "source": {"uri": "cp24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse24.com

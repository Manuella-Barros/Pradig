Promising reviews: \"I was looking for a makeup brush and came across this little gem. I was hesitant for a couple of reasons. First off, the price! I thought surely nothing of quality could come at this price. Also, I wasn't familiar with this brand or type of brush. After reading some reviews and researching a bit more I figured why not. After all, its cheap enough. I was beyond surprised when it arrived. First of all it came in this little container that can be great for travel or just storage in general! Loved that! Then felt the bristles and used it for the first time. Wow! Just wow! It worked amazing. I use it for blending foundation and it works ? better than expected. I can't believe how impressed I am with this product. It feels wonderful on my face and is completely easy to do a quick wipe off. Its definitely worth the low price. Give it a try!\" \u2014Jennifer Reinhart \"As a professional makeup artist who has worked on actors, this brush saves so much time and it's BETTER than the Beauty Blender. No joke. Try it!!!\" \u2014Taylor Get it from Amazon for $6.89+ (available in 12 colors).", "summary": "<h1>We can't *make up* how good these are.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/6/21/enhanced/9798ed2a56ff/original-605-1717708004-2.jpg?crop=2984:1989;0,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/julialynnrubin/makeup-artists-are-obsessed-these\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/julialynnrubin/makeup-artists-are-obsessed-these", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/3/3/campaign_images/3dac409dd2a9/makeup-artists-are-obsessed-with-these-29-product-3-1022-1717384971-1_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:31:02", "author": "Haley Zovickian,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Julia Lynn Rubin", "authors": ["Haley Zovickian", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Julia Lynn Rubin"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.623}

{"id": 223705436, "title": "Joe Torres offers Angels reminder about perils of prospects", "text": "What are the Angels selling at Angel Stadium this season? The waffles are pretty good \u2014 and, dare we say it, a bargain for ballpark food. For $12, you get a warm waffle, topped with strawberries and cream or S\u2019Mores. On the field, the last-place Angels are selling hope and faith, the currency of another bummer summer. Let the kids play, and hope the likes of Jo Adell, Logan O\u2019Hoppe, Zach Neto, Nolan Schanuel and Jos\u00e9 Soriano blossom into the core of the Angels\u2019 next great team. With the Cleveland Guardians in Anaheim this weekend, the Angels need only peer into the visiting dugout for a reminder of the perils of counting on a core of prospects. Joe Torres, the Guardians\u2019 assistant pitching coach, was the Angels\u2019 top draft pick in 2000. He was part of a touted core of Angels prospect two decades ago, along with infielders Casey Kotchman, Dallas McPherson and Brandon Wood and catchers Jeff Mathis and Mike Napoli. \u201cAs an organization, you just want to stack as many prospects as you can,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we are. It\u2019s just a label, until you get to the big leagues and play. \u201cIt\u2019s a different animal up here. The game adapts to you. You have to find a way to adapt back, and quickly. It\u2019s a tough game. It\u2019s not easy. I don\u2019t care who you are.\u201d In terms of prospect rankings, the Torres group ranked higher than the current group. Kotchman, Mathis, McPherson and Wood each ranked among the game\u2019s top 25 prospects during his minor league career. \u201cIt was a pretty talented group,\u201d Torres said. McPherson\u2019s major league career was derailed by injury. Wood\u2019s career was derailed by anxiety. Kotchman played for seven teams in a 10-year career. Mathis played for six teams over 17 years, a career .194 hitter cherished for his defensive wizardry. Napoli enjoyed the best career of them all, most of it after the Angels traded him for outfielder Vernon Wells in an ill-advised and ownership-driven move. Napoli was the only one to make an All-Star team. The 2001 draft class, to which Torres belonged, was not stellar. Of the 40 players selected in the first round, 17 never made the majors, and another 17 put up a career Wins Above Replacement below 2.0. Torres was one of those who never made the majors. He also was one of those who was never as good after his Tommy John surgery, a reminder that no procedure has a 100% success rate. When the Angels drafted him, Torres said, he threw as hard as 97 mph. After the surgery? \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I saw 93 again,\u201d he said. The Angels released him in 2006. Over the next seven years, he played for minor league teams in eight states, and winter ball in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. He loves coaching, a second career that might never have happened if he had developed into a star. \u201cI think what I went through as a player,\u201d he said, \u201cthe failures, the injuries, having been a top prospect and all, and then being on the other end of it, the grinder minor leaguer trying to find your way through it all, it felt like I had a lot of experiences and things that I could share and be able to work with players.\u201d He has stories to share. Napoli set him up with his wife. He and McPherson coached a high school team together one spring in Georgia. If he ever tires of coaching, he has an aptitude for scouting. In 2009, he was playing in the California League, for a team that wanted to make a pitcher out of one of its catchers. \u201cI was his first catch partner,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI\u2019m older by that time, been around a little bit. I look at him and go, \u2018Hey, man, I don\u2019t think you realize how good you are. You might be in the big leagues next year. You\u2019re that good.\u2019 \u201d Sure enough, Kenley Jansen was in the big leagues the next year.", "summary": "Cleveland Guardians assistant pitching coach Joe Torres was once part of an Angels core of top prospects, but he was never able to play in Anaheim.", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/story/2024-05-26/joe-torres-angels-core-prospects", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1955a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4535x2381+0+308/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2Fe1%2F0e3369484fa5adbd6867822c476d%2Fguardians-2024-baseb", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:49", "author": "Bill Shaikin", "authors": ["Bill Shaikin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.185}

You could save yourself a fortune by employing a straightforward security measure to prevent a major headache in future. RegTransfer's number plate experts say drivers should always double-check their vehicle is locked and secure before walking away. The specialists acknowledge that by not doing so, car owners are significantly increasing the risk of falling victim to crime, which could have repercussions for their insurance in the future. In 2023 alone, police forces across England and Wales received an astonishing 363,321 reports of car theft, RegTransfer said. Leaving a car door unlocked, essentially inviting thieves inside, is cited as one of the most common methods of theft, even though easily avoided, reports the Express.

A worrying 40 per cent of thefts involved the \"hacking\" of signals from keyless entry systems, a trend that has seen a significant increase in recent times. At the other end of the scale, brute force tactics such as smashing windows to get into a car made up only 16 per cent of reported crimes last year. This is a decrease from 27 per cent a decade ago, indicating that criminals are adapting and trying new strategies to fit the current technology. Mark Trimbee, CEO of RegTransfers, emphasises the importance of drivers taking immediate steps to protect themselves from becoming easy targets. He advised: \"It should become a habitual behaviour to lock up your car, even if you're just refuelling or parking briefly in your driveway. You should never leave your vehicle running if you're leaving the driver's seat, and keep an eye out to make sure all windows and sunroofs are fully closed.\" \"For keyless entry cars, it's wise to reprogram keys when buying a second-hand car. Using signal-blocking pouches can prevent relay attacks, and investing in a steering wheel lock adds an extra layer of security - for both keyed and keyless cars.\" He also recommended: \"While you're out on the road, keep your doors locked and maintain enough space to manoeuvre in traffic.\" Statistics indicate that 53 per cent of crimes involving theft of personal items resulted from unlocked car doors. A third of these (27 per cent) culminated in huge financial losses of \u00a315,000 or more. RegTransfer has also warned that car insurance suppliers usually turn down claims if a vehicle has been accessed due to an open window or keys left in the ignition.

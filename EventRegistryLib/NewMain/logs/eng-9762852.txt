Here's what you need to know.", "body": "When Hurricane Beryl swept through southeast Texas on July 8, its damaging 80-mile-per-hour winds took down thousands of trees and knocked out much of the electricity system. More than 2.6 million Texas power customers went without electricity for days in the summer heat.\n\nIn the days that followed the storm, officials and residents alike turned their eyes to the Houston area's electric utility, CenterPoint Energy. Texans criticized the company for failing to prepare adequately for the storm, communicate clearly with customers and restore power efficiently.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nGov. Greg Abbott threatened the company, legislators quickly called hearings about the outages and the state's utility regulators launched an investigation.\n\nCenterPoint fumbled communications\n\nFor days after the storm, CenterPoint did not offer Texans a clear timeline for when power would be restored and its power outage map was offline. That made it difficult for people to decide whether they should wait it out at their homes without air conditioning or head elsewhere. Houstonians turned to a variety of workarounds to figure out which neighborhoods had power -- including using Whataburger's app to discern where the electricity was flowing.\n\nWhen the CenterPoint outage map was back online, people said it was unreliable and couldn't say when they could expect the power to come back on. A week after the storm, hundreds of thousands of customers still had no power.\n\nCenterPoint's restoration pace drew criticism\n\nAt the height of the outages more than 2.6 million Texas households and businesses were in the dark. At least 23 people died from the storm itself and the ensuing power outages.\n\nHouston's vulnerability to storms is well known. Unlike a winter storm in 2021 where the energy grid struggled to meet demand, Beryl damaged the distribution infrastructure like poles and wires that bring power to homes.\n\nEd Hirs, an energy expert at the University of Houston, said the power outages during this storm are a product of extended neglect and underinvestment in grid infrastructure by the state and utilities.\n\nBut as people waited in the humid, sweltering heat, they looked for who to blame. Many were angered by the speed in which the company was restoring power. Elected officials began to ask why so much distribution infrastructure was damaged and why it was taking so long to fix.\n\n\"In most cases when people lose power it's because powerlines go down, but it's normally short lived,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. In this case, he added, the response took days.\n\nCenterPoint defended its readiness and electricity restoration pace, which was faster than it had been after previous storms. But people still wanted answers: Was the utility company prepared for the hurricane? Is it prepared for future ones? And what happened to its communications?\n\nDidn't Texas officials say they fixed the power grid?\n\nAfter Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when nearly statewide power outages persisted for days the entire electricity grid nearly collapsed, lawmakers decided Texas needed more power to meet demand. They focused their efforts on securing power generation, or fuel that is then turned into electricity, through weatherizing existing facilities and allocating $5 billion to incentivize companies to build more gas-fueled power generators in the state.\n\nBut Beryl highlighted the need to strengthen the state's electrical distribution infrastructure, which transmits already generated electricity to individual customers, against future storms and hurricanes. Energy experts said that could include protecting existing power lines from trees by trimming them, building robust poles out of concrete or plastic and undergrounding power lines where it makes sense.\n\nWhat oversight does Texas have over utility companies?\n\nIn Texas, utilities do not compete with each other, but have designated jurisdictions that they serve. The Public Utility Commission of Texas regulates electricity and oversees utilities like CenterPoint. The PUC commissioners are appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott and their job is to review and approve rates charged by utilities, review the planning and construction of utility infrastructure like power lines and coordinate with utilities on how to prepare and respond to hurricanes or other natural disasters.\n\nEssentially any type of infrastructure project or rate increase utilities like CenterPoint proposes needs to be greenlit by the PUC.\n\nThe PUC could punish CenterPoint with a fine for its handling of Hurricane Beryl's outages. But when disasters strike, Ed Hirs, an energy expert at the University of Houston, said regulators typically skip the fine and rely on the expectation that \"the cost of the cleanup is going to be more than enough penalty.\"\n\nHe said regulators often prefer companies spend money repairing damage rather than sending it to the state as a fine. Regulators also could require CenterPoint to put money into strengthening its infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to the PUC's oversight, utilities must also comply with rules and regulations that the Legislature writes into law.\n\nPublic Utility Commission investigating CenterPoint\n\nThe PUC is investigating CenterPoint's preparations and response to Hurricane Beryl. The investigation, which was directed by Gov. Greg Abbott, will look into the company's emergency plans, vegetation management like tree trimming, infrastructure fortifications, and use of mobile generators. The aim? To uncover the root causes of persistent power outages in Houston and nearby areas.\n\nThe PUC must deliver a report with its findings and recommendations to the governor by Dec. 1.\n\nCenterPoint has asked for an extension on its request to raise rates\n\nCenterPoint earlier this year filed an application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking to raise rates to cover costs and keep up with the area's growth. Utility officials said the average residential bill would increase by about $1.25, according to the company filings.\n\nUtility companies do not make money by doing maintenance like tree trimming or hardening powerlines, but by expanding infrastructure coverage, according to energy experts. But the PUC controls how much money a regulated utility like CenterPoint can make.\n\nTo make their case for a rate increase, CenterPoint officials said they now served 300,000 more customers compared to when the company last requested to change its rates in 2019. They expected both population and industrial growth to continue with a shift toward electrification and potential buildout of hydrogen production facilities.\n\nUtility officials said in the filings that they were both expanding the system and keeping up with needed repairs. The company invested more than $6 billion in infrastructure over the past five years while also responding to \"unprecedented weather conditions\" including drought, winter storms and hurricanes.\"Each event had its impact on the system,\" said Lynnae Wilson, senior vice president of electric business. \"Drought conditions lead to dead or stressed trees that are more susceptible to high winds. Any system damage as a result of weather events in turn caused customer outages.\"\n\nThe company said it spent $31.9 million on vegetation management in 2022 and increased its spending on reliability projects.\n\n\"CenterPoint Houston faces increasingly high expectations from customers in terms of more reliable service and faster restoration following outages, and from regulators and policymakers increasingly concerned with strengthening the electric grid in Texas,\" Jason Ryan, executive vice president of regulatory services and government affairs, said in the March 6 filings.\n\nOn July 17, after public outrage over Beryl's mass power outages, CenterPoint requested more time to keep working through the rate case discussions with the other parties involved. Entities such as the Houston Coalition of Cities, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers and Texas Consumer Association were already weighing in on the proposed rate hike. An administrative judge considering the proposed increase requested that parties file status reports by August 2 and every two weeks after.\n\nRegulators are also reviewing CenterPoint's $2 billion resiliency plan\n\nUtility companies like CenterPoint can choose to create plans to strengthen their electrical systems, according to a law that went into effect last year.\n\nThe so-called resiliency plan -- if state regulators approve it -- is a potential way utilities could start charging more to harden their distribution infrastructure by replacing poles or trimming more trees. In many cases, those costs would be charged to power providers that sell power, which would then likely pass the costs on to residents and businesses.\n\nMichael Webber, an energy resources professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said spending more up front for a stronger electric system would save money and even protect peoples' lives and health better over the long term. That's because there would be less damage to infrastructure after storms -- and fewer people without power, too.\n\nIn its proposed resiliency plan submitted to regulators in April, Centerpoint suggested investing more than $2 billion to strengthen its poles and wires, using federal and state funding to cover some of the costs. The proposal included spending $376 million to replace wooden transmission structures with steel or concrete, and $99 million to replace or brace some 5,000 wooden distribution poles per year from 2025 to 2027.\n\nEnergy experts told The Houston Landing that CenterPoint's proposed funding for the plan is only a fraction of what's needed for upgrades to protect the system against bad weather. The Landing also reports that plan does not include details on where upgrades will be made and predictions on how many customers might benefit from proposals to harden the distribution infrastructure.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott wants to know CenterPoint's plans to keep the power on\n\nGov. Greg Abbott asked CenterPoint to send his office a detailed plan by the end of July outlining how it plans to protect the power supply through the rest of what is expected to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAbbott said the plan must include better preparation for linemen who repair damage, increasing the number of workers to restore power and how the company will pre-stage sufficient workers to immediately respond to future outages. He also asked the plan to include details on future trimming trees and removing vegetation that threaten power lines -- the leading cause of infrastructure damage during Beryl.\n\nIf CenterPoint fails to comply with his request, the governor said he will issue an executive order imposing his own requirements on the company, but it's not clear what those would be or what direct power he has over the utility. And he said that if the utility is unable to \"fix its ongoing problems,\" the state would have to reconsider the breadth of the territory it serves.\n\nThe governor has asked CenterPoint to remove vegetation around power lines no later than Aug. 31.\n\nTexas House and Senate also looking into the mass power outages\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, has formed a Special Committee on Hurricane and Tropical Storm Preparedness, Recovery, and Electricity. Its members include several Houston-area and southeastern Texas senators. Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, will chair the committee, with Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, as vice chair. The committee will review state and electrical utility company's preparedness for and responses to hurricanes and tropical storms. The first meeting, open for public testimony, is on July 29.\n\nThe House State Affairs committee will meet July 31 to discuss utility resiliency plans and assess utility preparedness, response, and recovery protocols given the recent storms.\n\nJoshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said the challenge is utility companies do not make money by doing maintenance like tree trimming or hardening powerlines. Utilities make money by expanding infrastructure coverage. But the PUC controls how much money a regulated utility like CenterPoint can make and the Legislature controls what they can make money on.\n\nHe said lawmakers will need to find ways to \"incentivize utilities to shift to maintenance\" during the legislative session that begins in January.\n\n\"During winter storms you can put more clothes and more blankets on, but with heat at some point you just feel it and need AC. The magnitude of the human suffering is large in [Hurricane Beryl] and it will kick off a response,\" he said.\n\nDisclosure: CenterPoint Energy, University of Texas at Austin and University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

In this case, he added, the response took days.\n\nCenterPoint defended its readiness and electricity restoration pace, which was faster than it had been after previous storms. But people still wanted answers: Was the utility company prepared for the hurricane? Is it prepared for future ones? And what happened to its communications?\n\nAfter Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when nearly statewide power outages persisted for days the entire electricity grid nearly collapsed, lawmakers decided Texas needed more power to meet demand. They focused their efforts on securing power generation, or fuel that is then turned into electricity, through weatherizing existing facilities and allocating $5 billion to incentivize companies to build more gas-fueled power generators in the state.\n\nBut Beryl highlighted the need to strengthen the state's electrical distribution infrastructure, which transmits already generated electricity to individual customers, against future storms and hurricanes. Energy experts said that could include protecting existing power lines from trees by trimming them, building robust poles out of concrete or plastic and undergrounding power lines where it makes sense.\n\nIn Texas, utilities do not compete with each other, but have designated jurisdictions that they serve. The Public Utility Commission of Texas regulates electricity and oversees utilities like CenterPoint. The PUC commissioners are appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott and their job is to review and approve rates charged by utilities, review the planning and construction of utility infrastructure like power lines and coordinate with utilities on how to prepare and respond to hurricanes or other natural disasters.\n\nEssentially any type of infrastructure project or rate increase utilities like CenterPoint proposes needs to be greenlit by the PUC.\n\nThe PUC could punish CenterPoint with a fine for its handling of Hurricane Beryl's outages. But when disasters strike, Ed Hirs, an energy expert at the University of Houston, said regulators typically skip the fine and rely on the expectation that \"the cost of the cleanup is going to be more than enough penalty.\"\n\nHe said regulators often prefer companies spend money repairing damage rather than sending it to the state as a fine. Regulators also could require CenterPoint to put money into strengthening its infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to the PUC's oversight, utilities must also comply with rules and regulations that the Legislature writes into law.\n\nThe PUC is investigating CenterPoint's preparations and response to Hurricane Beryl. The investigation, which was directed by Gov. Greg Abbott, will look into the company's emergency plans, vegetation management like tree trimming, infrastructure fortifications, and use of mobile generators. The aim? To uncover the root causes of persistent power outages in Houston and nearby areas.\n\nThe PUC must deliver a report with its findings and recommendations to the governor by Dec. 1.\n\nCenterPoint earlier this year filed an application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking to raise rates to cover costs and keep up with the area's growth. Utility officials said the average residential bill would increase by about $1.25, according to the company filings.\n\nUtility companies do not make money by doing maintenance like tree trimming or hardening powerlines, but by expanding infrastructure coverage, according to energy experts. But the PUC controls how much money a regulated utility like CenterPoint can make.\n\nTo make their case for a rate increase, CenterPoint officials said they now served 300,000 more customers compared to when the company last requested to change its rates in 2019. They expected both population and industrial growth to continue with a shift toward electrification and potential buildout of hydrogen production facilities.\n\nUtility officials said in the filings that they were both expanding the system and keeping up with needed repairs. The company invested more than $6 billion in infrastructure over the past five years while also responding to \"unprecedented weather conditions\" including drought, winter storms and hurricanes.\"Each event had its impact on the system,\" said Lynnae Wilson, senior vice president of electric business. \"Drought conditions lead to dead or stressed trees that are more susceptible to high winds. Any system damage as a result of weather events in turn caused customer outages.\"\n\nThe company said it spent $31.9 million on vegetation management in 2022 and increased its spending on reliability projects.\n\n\"CenterPoint Houston faces increasingly high expectations from customers in terms of more reliable service and faster restoration following outages, and from regulators and policymakers increasingly concerned with strengthening the electric grid in Texas,\" Jason Ryan, executive vice president of regulatory services and government affairs, said in the March 6 filings.\n\nOn July 17, after public outrage over Beryl's mass power outages, CenterPoint requested more time to keep working through the rate case discussions with the other parties involved. Entities such as the Houston Coalition of Cities, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers and Texas Consumer Association were already weighing in on the proposed rate hike. An administrative judge considering the proposed increase requested that parties file status reports by August 2 and every two weeks after.\n\nUtility companies like CenterPoint can choose to create plans to strengthen their electrical systems, according to a law that went into effect last year.\n\nThe so-called resiliency plan -- if state regulators approve it -- is a potential way utilities could start charging more to harden their distribution infrastructure by replacing poles or trimming more trees. In many cases, those costs would be charged to power providers that sell power, which would then likely pass the costs on to residents and businesses.\n\nMichael Webber, an energy resources professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said spending more up front for a stronger electric system would save money and even protect peoples' lives and health better over the long term. That's because there would be less damage to infrastructure after storms -- and fewer people without power, too.\n\nIn its proposed resiliency plan submitted to regulators in April, Centerpoint suggested investing more than $2 billion to strengthen its poles and wires, using federal and state funding to cover some of the costs. The proposal included spending $376 million to replace wooden transmission structures with steel or concrete, and $99 million to replace or brace some 5,000 wooden distribution poles per year from 2025 to 2027.\n\nEnergy experts told The Houston Landing that CenterPoint's proposed funding for the plan is only a fraction of what's needed for upgrades to protect the system against bad weather. The Landing also reports that plan does not include details on where upgrades will be made and predictions on how many customers might benefit from proposals to harden the distribution infrastructure.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott asked CenterPoint to send his office a detailed plan by the end of July outlining how it plans to protect the power supply through the rest of what is expected to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAbbott said the plan must include better preparation for linemen who repair damage, increasing the number of workers to restore power and how the company will pre-stage sufficient workers to immediately respond to future outages. He also asked the plan to include details on future trimming trees and removing vegetation that threaten power lines -- the leading cause of infrastructure damage during Beryl.\n\nIf CenterPoint fails to comply with his request, the governor said he will issue an executive order imposing his own requirements on the company, but it's not clear what those would be or what direct power he has over the utility. And he said that if the utility is unable to \"fix its ongoing problems,\" the state would have to reconsider the breadth of the territory it serves.\n\nThe governor has asked CenterPoint to remove vegetation around power lines no later than Aug. 31.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, has formed a Special Committee on Hurricane and Tropical Storm Preparedness, Recovery, and Electricity. Its members include several Houston-area and southeastern Texas senators. Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, will chair the committee, with Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, as vice chair. The committee will review state and electrical utility company's preparedness for and responses to hurricanes and tropical storms. The first meeting, open for public testimony, is on July 29.\n\nThe House State Affairs committee will meet July 31 to discuss utility resiliency plans and assess utility preparedness, response, and recovery protocols given the recent storms.\n\nJoshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said the challenge is utility companies do not make money by doing maintenance like tree trimming or hardening powerlines. Utilities make money by expanding infrastructure coverage. But the PUC controls how much money a regulated utility like CenterPoint can make and the Legislature controls what they can make money on.\n\nHe said lawmakers will need to find ways to \"incentivize utilities to shift to maintenance\" during the legislative session that begins in January.\n\n\"During winter storms you can put more clothes and more blankets on, but with heat at some point you just feel it and need AC. The magnitude of the human suffering is large in [Hurricane Beryl] and it will kick off a response,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

At least 27 people died because of the hurricane, with many deaths attributed to heat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I want to apologize to our customers for the frustration we caused,\" Wells said. \"We will do better.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While we cannot erase the frustrations or difficulties so many of our customers endured, I, and my entire leadership team, will not make excuses,\" he added. \"We will improve and act with a sense of urgency.\"\n\nPolitical Points\n\nGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nCenterPoint has faced the brunt of the blowback in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall July 8 as a Category 1 storm and hit the Houston area with 6 to 8 inches of rain and sustained winds of 80 mph. It was the first hurricane to hit Houston since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nAt its height, about 2.26 million CenterPoint customers were without power. The company restored power to 1 million customers within 48 hours, but power outages lingered for days for thousands. The Perryman Group economics firm estimated the storm caused $4.6 billion in damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCenterPoint owns and maintains power transmission and distribution lines in the Houston area. Like Oncor in Dallas-Fort Worth, it is a government-approved monopoly with a guaranteed revenue stream that makes up a significant component of electricity bills.\n\nThe company and Wells have faced withering criticism in the weeks since Beryl. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered electric regulators at the Public Utility Commission to investigate CenterPoint, which led to Wells and other officials addressing the commission Thursday in Austin.\n\nSpeaking during a public comment period, Houston ISD Board Trustee Savant Moore read the names of 24 people killed by Hurricane Beryl and asked that CenterPoint \"show us the same respect they give their shareholders.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While CEO of CenterPoint and the VP of utilities went a few hours to two days without power, my community suffered nine to 14 days,\" Moore said. \"Some in Northeast Houston still do not have power.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCenterPoint's website indicated that about 2,400 customers were without power Thursday afternoon. It was unclear if those outages were related to Beryl.\n\nCenterPoint officials outlined their strategy to address future emergencies, including ways to improve communication. During the storm, the company's power outage map failed, leaving the state's most populous city and its emergency officials without a crucial tool to track damage.\n\nHouston emergency officials scrambled to create their own outage map, the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday, and some residents turned to a Whataburger restaurant location map to discern where the lights and air conditioning might be on in their community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCenterPoint's outage tracker failed because it could not keep up with web traffic, said Tony Gardner, CenterPoint's chief customer officer.\n\n\"It was a physical server-based system, which simply could not handle the traffic during elevated storm-level events,\" he told the utility commission.\n\nThe company will have a new outage tracker available by Aug. 1. Gardner also outlined a new communications strategy that would include daily briefings during significant outage events.\n\nCenterPoint emerged from Thursday's hearing with a pending $2.2 billion resiliency plan intact, despite some calls for the company to withdraw the request. The company is asking for costs to harden its wires system and other maintenance activities to be passed along to ratepayers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Beryl's aftermath, community organizations, PUC staff and CenterPoint itself have asked the Public Utility Commission to postpone the application. No action was taken Thursday, but the company stopped short of withdrawing its application - something Commissioner Lori Cobos said she had expected to allow time to complete investigations into the company's emergency response.\n\nShe said it would be a disservice to conduct administrative hearings on CenterPoint's resiliency plan before lawmakers and commissioners have a chance to weigh in.\n\nNorth Texas' electric distribution and transmission provider Oncor has asked the commission to approve a $3.4 billion resiliency plan, according to its application. Like CenterPoint, those costs would be passed along to ratepayers.\n\nOn Monday, CenterPoint officials will appear before a special state Senate committee formed in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl. The hearing could be politically fraught for CenterPoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who created the committee and criticized the response to Beryl, has said \"a freight train\" is coming for CenterPoint.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The PUC is responsible for making sure customers get reliable power and oversees utility costs.\n\n[CenterPoint draws state ire after Hurricane Beryl power outages. Here's what you need to know.]\n\nCenterPoint maintains power poles and lines to deliver electricity in the area. Wells said the company would significantly increase its vegetation management, which includes trimming tree branches near power lines, and launch a new outage tracker by Aug. 1. It will also hire a new senior leader to focus on emergency response coordination.\n\n\"In times of emergency, our responsibility is to respond quickly, to communicate clearly, to provide accurate information and to restore power as rapidly and safely as we can,\" Wells said. \"I take personal accountability for the areas where we fell short of our customers' expectations. Most importantly, I want to apologize to our customers for the frustration we caused. We will do better.\"\n\nCenterPoint officials during the meeting repeatedly committed to make changes urgently. But the conversation still left unanswered questions of why the utility hadn't done more to strengthen its system in the first place -- and what roles regulators, legislators and the utility had to play in the choices made.\n\n\"Some of the things that I heard today are things that the company should have already been thinking about doing,\" PUC Commissioner Lori Cobos said.\n\nA member of the public from Houston who came to speak to regulators set the tone of the meeting by reading the names of people who died in the storm. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences has so far confirmed 18 people who died from Beryl. Eight of those deaths were caused by overheating. Across the state, officials have identified at least five more storm-related deaths.\n\nSome 2.26 million CenterPoint customers lost power when Hurricane Beryl made landfall southwest of Houston on July 8 and pushed up into the sprawling city as a Category 1 storm, taking down trees and tree limbs.\n\nIn the days that followed, officials and residents heaped criticism on CenterPoint for failing to prepare adequately, communicate clearly and restore power efficiently. CenterPoint's outage tracker was down, so residents did not quickly get clear information for when the power would come back. Hundreds of thousands still had no power one week after Beryl hit as the region endured dangerous heat.\n\nThe PUC has launched an investigation into CenterPoint. Gov. Greg Abbott, who appoints PUC commissioners, also called on CenterPoint to send him a memo outlining how it plans to do better during the rest of hurricane season. Two legislative committees will hold hearings next week on the state's and utility companies' disaster preparedness.\n\n[Why Texas' mass power outages continue to happen]\n\nThe company officials said they were already holding small group listening sessions, brought in experts to review its emergency response and nearly doubled their vegetation management workforce. But they said they still faced hurdles.\n\nTheir challenges include not having direct contact information for more than half of its customers because retail electric companies that sell power to residents and businesses maintain that data. CenterPoint officials said they would need new regulatory policy from the PUC to make it easier to get that information from the retail companies.\n\nCommissioners cautioned other utilities in the state to take what happened during Beryl as a warning.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call to every utility around our state, that they have to take serious the storms that are facing their system, the challenges that are facing their systems, whether it be a wildfire that's going to let their customers go out, or a big storm or a derecho,\" PUC Commissioner Jimmy Glotfelty said.\n\nGlotfelty continued to the CenterPoint executives: \"I don't care what it is, you all know your system the best. But y'all have to do better. The customers deserve better. And we all are giving you a return that expects better. I know y'all can do it. I really do.

We will do better. While we cannot erase the frustrations and difficulties so many of our customers endured, I and my entire leadership team will not make excuses,\" said Jason Wells, the president and CEO at CenterPoint. \"We will improve and act with a sense of urgency.\"\n\nRoughly 2.2 million customers lost power after the Category 1 hurricane struck the Houston area on July 8. CenterPoint restored power to 1 million in the first 48 hours and finished restoring power to all remaining customers who are able to receive power on July 20.\n\nAt least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people - ranging in age from 50 to 110 - who died from \"heat exposure due to power loss,\" according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets.\n\nThe lengthy outages and lack of accurate information amid the scorching summer heat triggered anger and frustration across the city.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott asked the Public Utility Commission to launch an investigation into CenterPoint and present its findings by Dec. 1. The Texas State Senate is also holding a hearing on Monday on the outages.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick blasted the company in a press conference on July 14. \"A freight train's coming. You just heard it. You better be prepared. Whether you're at the top or any part of management who oversaw this response or preparation, everybody's job should be on the line,\" he said. \"We will not and cannot tolerate this.\"\n\nWells, the CEO, and other executives summarized some of the initiatives on Thursday that they will launch to help enhance their communications with the public and efforts to improve from within the company.\n\nThe company plans to hire a new senior leader on its executive team to focus on improvements to its emergency and storm response; seek independent analysis from experts; launch a new cloud-based outage tracker after their original one failed for customers; provide daily press briefings after storms; expedite estimated times for restoration to its customers; and improve its alert notifications directly to customers through text, email or phone.\n\nThe company only has direct contact information for 42% of its customers, executives said Thursday, citing policies that limit the company's ability to reach out for more information to reach its customers.\n\nCenterPoint officials said they would also increase their call center staffing by 165% to help reduce wait times for customers calling about their power situations.\n\n\"While the thousands on the ground worked incredibly hard to restore power and achieve significant impact in the first 48 hours, it is clear we must continue to enhance the resiliency of our system to support faster restoration times,\" said Randy Pryor, a vice president at CenterPoint who served as the incident commander during the storm.\n\nFrustration with lengthy outages\n\nThursday's meeting opened with public comment. Savant Moore, a Houston resident and elected trustee for the Houston Independent School District, highlighted some of the struggles faced by the city's most vulnerable during the power outages - such as seniors depending on oxygen and insulin.\n\n\"Electricity was created in the late 1800s, yet we still haven't figured out power outage solutions,\" he said. \"What will this board and the government do to protect Texans' lives from such mismanagement?\"\n\nCommissioners on the Public Utility Commission expressed frustration as well. Commissioner Lori Cobos complimented CenterPoint for outlining some of its plans to improve but said \"a lot of what I heard seems like things that y'all should have already been doing.\"\n\nCobos, who toured the area after the storm, called the Houston aftermath \"devastating.\"\n\n\"Your performance will be judged by your actions and the results from those actions,\" she added. \"Accountability is very important.\"\n\nCommissioner Jimmy Glotfelty criticized the company's admitted statistic that it only has contact information for 42% of its customers.\n\n\"You all have equipment on their premises. So they are your customers. And if you don't have the information to your customers, then that's your fault,\" he said. \"And I know you want to change that, and I know, as we've restructured this industry, most of the contact has gone to the retail electric provider, you all are still the bread and butter of Houston, Texas, distributing electricity. So I hope you all find a way to become critical to your customers.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_killough@cnn.com", "name": "Ashley

A week after the storm, hundreds of thousands of customers still had no power.\n\nAt the height of the outages more than 2.6 million Texas households and businesses were in the dark. At least 23 people died from the storm itself and the ensuing power outages.\n\nHouston's vulnerability to storms is well known. Unlike a winter storm in 2021 where the energy grid struggled to meet demand, Beryl damaged the distribution infrastructure like poles and wires that bring power to homes.\n\nEd Hirs, an energy expert at the University of Houston, said the power outages during this storm are a product of extended neglect and underinvestment in grid infrastructure by the state and utilities.\n\nBut as people waited in the humid, sweltering heat, they looked for who to blame. Many were angered by the speed in which the company was restoring power. Elected officials began to ask why so much distribution infrastructure was damaged and why it was taking so long to fix.\n\n\"In most cases when people lose power it's because powerlines go down, but it's normally short lived,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. In this case, he added, the response took days.\n\nCenterPoint defended its readiness and electricity restoration pace, which was faster than it had been after previous storms.

We will do better. While we cannot erase the frustrations and difficulties so many of our customers endured, I and my entire leadership team will not make excuses,\" said Jason Wells, the president and CEO at CenterPoint. \"We will improve and act with a sense of urgency.\"\n\nRoughly 2.2 million customers lost power after the Category 1 hurricane struck the Houston area on July 8. CenterPoint restored power to 1 million in the first 48 hours and finished restoring power to all remaining customers who are able to receive power on July 20.\n\nAt least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people - ranging in age from 50 to 110 - who died from \"heat exposure due to power loss,\" according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets.\n\nThe lengthy outages and lack of accurate information amid the scorching summer heat triggered anger and frustration across the city.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott asked the Public Utility Commission to launch an investigation into CenterPoint and present its findings by Dec. 1. The Texas State Senate is also holding a hearing on Monday on the outages.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick blasted the company in a press conference on July 14. \"A freight train's coming. You just heard it. You better be prepared. Whether you're at the top or any part of management who oversaw this response or preparation, everybody's job should be on the line,\" he said. \"We will not and cannot tolerate this.\"\n\nWells, the CEO, and other executives summarized some of the initiatives on Thursday that they will launch to help enhance their communications with the public and efforts to improve from within the company.\n\nThe company plans to hire a new senior leader on its executive team to focus on improvements to its emergency and storm response; seek independent analysis from experts; launch a new cloud-based outage tracker after their original one failed for customers; provide daily press briefings after storms; expedite estimated times for restoration to its customers; and improve its alert notifications directly to customers through text, email or phone.\n\nThe company only has direct contact information for 42% of its customers, executives said Thursday, citing policies that limit the company's ability to reach out for more information to reach its customers.\n\nCenterPoint officials said they would also increase their call center staffing by 165% to help reduce wait times for customers calling about their power situations.\n\n\"While the thousands on the ground worked incredibly hard to restore power and achieve significant impact in the first 48 hours, it is clear we must continue to enhance the resiliency of our system to support faster restoration times,\" said Randy Pryor, a vice president at CenterPoint who served as the incident commander during the storm.\n\nFrustration with lengthy outages\n\nThursday's meeting opened with public comment. Savant Moore, a Houston resident and elected trustee for the Houston Independent School District, highlighted some of the struggles faced by the city's most vulnerable during the power outages - such as seniors depending on oxygen and insulin.\n\n\"Electricity was created in the late 1800s, yet we still haven't figured out power outage solutions,\" he said. \"What will this board and the government do to protect Texans' lives from such mismanagement?\"\n\nCommissioners on the Public Utility Commission expressed frustration as well. Commissioner Lori Cobos complimented CenterPoint for outlining some of its plans to improve but said \"a lot of what I heard seems like things that y'all should have already been doing.\"\n\nCobos, who toured the area after the storm, called the Houston aftermath \"devastating.\"\n\n\"Your performance will be judged by your actions and the results from those actions,\" she added. \"Accountability is very important.\"\n\nCommissioner Jimmy Glotfelty criticized the company's admitted statistic that it only has contact information for 42% of its customers.\n\n\"You all have equipment on their premises. So they are your customers. And if you don't have the information to your customers, then that's your fault,\" he said. \"And I know you want to change that, and I know, as we've restructured this industry, most of the contact has gone to the retail electric provider, you all are still the bread and butter of Houston, Texas, distributing electricity.

Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, Ike, Ian and now Beryl are all named storms that will forever remain in utilities' collective conscience. But in my 30 years of watching and covering this industry, I have never seen the same public derision and criticism of a utility that I saw with CenterPoint Energy over the last couple of weeks in the aftermath of Beryl.\n\nAny time a weather disaster hits the U.S, causing catastrophic damage and power outages, we see scrutiny of the utility response: that's par for the course. The tendency is to blame someone when terrible things happen, and some of that scrutiny may help in that we have learned lessons over the years and improved resiliency and response on many fronts.\n\nHurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane on July 8. With significant sustained winds, storm surges and torrential rain, the hurricane caused widespread outages in CenterPoint's service territory. At its peak, 2.2 million electric customers were impacted. Before the hurricane even made landfall, the utility activated its emergency response plan to pre-position crews, set up staging sites, call for mutual assistance and take an all-hands-on-deck approach.\n\nSeventy-five percent of CenterPoint's distribution circuits were affected by vegetation; 16 transmission structures were damaged; more than 2,000 distribution poles were damaged; six CenterPoint-owned substations and 15 customer-owned substations were out at the peak of the storm. Vegetation crews had removed more than 12,100 trees from lines as of July 13.\n\nBy July 19, 10 days after Beryl made landfall, CenterPoint had restored power to 98% of affected customers. This was a record recovery; Ike knocked out power to about 2 million of CenterPoint's customers in 2008, and only 74% of impacted customers were restored by Day 10 at that time. If you look at the pure restoration efforts, CenterPoint knocked it out of the park.\n\nBut if you followed local Houston media you saw headlines such as: \"Why are CenterPoint repair trucks sitting in parking lots? Here's what we found out\" and \"After Hurricane Beryl, why does Whataburger have a better power outage map than CenterPoint?\" If you were on any social media sites and followed or searched for information around the storm, you would see complaints, misinformation and nastiness. Someone even painted \"Centerpointless\" under a Houston overpass.\n\nThere were also reports of attacks on lineworkers; Houston police had investigated at least five cases involving threats made to workers and other employees, whether in person or online. In one of the cases, police arrested Anthony Leonard, 38, charging him with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Authorities allege Leonard threw rocks and pointed a gun at a group of CenterPoint Energy workers who were at a staging area.\n\nCenterPoint Energy employs 9,000 people; it's sad to see that vitriol and anger directed at utility workers; they are the heroes who keep society running. Some associated or formerly associated with the utility tried to share what it takes to respond to a massive storm like that. One former employee published a letter to the editor in the Houston Chronicle explaining what goes into storm response: the amount of damage assessment, the amount of supplies needed, the commitment and dedication of all the employees no matter their role; and the balance between customers who demand reliable power but don't allow their trees to be trimmed.\n\nThe local and state government leaders even jumped in on the criticism; with a local city mayor tweeting using the words failed and disastrous. Texas Governor Abbott held a press conference slamming the utility. CenterPoint, in return, released a statement outlining what it did do to prepare for Beryl, including the staging of 3,000 crew members and coordination with mutual aid utilities, and details of what materials were on hand ready to put into service. CenterPoint also tried to correct misinformation swirling around in the media, such as \"payment of mutual assistance crews.\"\n\nI do not have to tell you what goes into storm preparation and response, but as utilities, be prepared for increasingly outspoken criticism when big storms like that hit. Particularly, with the proliferation of social media, derision, negativity and misinformation can spread like wildfire. Or like in this case, the temperatures are hotter or colder, making people miserable and emotions exacerbated. And the fact that we rely more on electricity for everything like never before.\n\nWhile the dedicated efforts of CenterPoint Energy in response to Hurricane Beryl showcased remarkable restoration capabilities and a swift recovery, the public reaction highlighted a growing challenge for utilities in this age of social media. Despite record-setting restoration achievements, the scrutiny and criticism, fueled by misinformation and heightened emotions, underscore the necessity for better communication and transparency. As the demand for reliable electricity continues to rise, utilities will not only focus on improving infrastructure and response strategies, but also on engaging with and educating the public to foster understanding and support during these critical times.", "source": {"uri": "tdworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "T&D World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chandler@tdworld.com", "name": "Nikki Chandler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CenterPoint_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CenterPoint Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataburger", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whataburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overpass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2024/07/66a2bf43778ea844f10cb3aa-dreamstime_m_326850110.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762852", "eventUri": "eng-9762852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 1122, "textEnd": 1128}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1888, "textEnd": 1895}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-19", "textStart": 1901, "textEnd": 1912}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

And the spotlight will be on CenterPoint, which submitted a resiliency plan for its transmission and distribution system to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) in late April. A major question for some Texas policymakers is how that plan stacks up against efforts by Florida, which seems faster at restoring power after major storms.\n\nThree days after Hurricane Beryl struck Houston, the PUC met in Austin to hear testimony from CenterPoint and other utilities. Commissioner Jimmy Glotfelty pointed to Florida's biggest power company and how it was able to quickly restore power after the last hurricane.\n\n\"This is not inexpensive, and it's not a short-term fix on the system. But resiliency works,\" Glotfelty said. \"And this has some significant reductions in time and expense to get systems back up if you harden them the correct way.\"\n\nGlotfelty outlined investments Florida Power & Light -- Florida's largest electric power utility -- has made, such as replacing wooden poles with stronger ones. And he called for the Florida utility to be part of the Texas discussion.\n\nPUC Chairman Thomas Gleeson seemed open to the idea, though he sounded less than enthusiastic. \"I'm sure there are things that work there that maybe wouldn't work here,\" Gleeson said. \"We'll find a Texas solution, obviously. But yeah, we can learn a lot from other places.\"\n\nCommissioner Kathleen Jackson added her voice to Glotfelty's. She noted that not only has Florida Power & Light's plan improved resiliency in the face of storms, but it has also improved daily reliability by more than 40% since 2006, slashing the average time a customer experiences an outage in any given year by nearly half the time.\n\n\"Shoring up the system in anticipation that management of risk for that critical event that you're trying to pay for, that worst case scenario, also helps shore up your ongoing reliability, which is something we can always use,\" Jackson said.\n\nThe Floridian experience\n\nFlorida Power & Light began improving the resilience of its transmission and distribution system more than 20 years ago, including burying miles of power lines. But what really sped up the process were the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, when eight named storms hit the state.\n\n\"The Florida Public Service Commission said, maybe there's something we can be doing here to improve the resilience of the infrastructure,\" according to Ted Kury, Director of Energy Studies at the University of Florida's Public Utility Research Center.\n\nKury said the Florida Public Service Commission, the agency that regulates the state's utilities, began getting much more aggressive, demanding more accountability and investment from its power companies. In the meantime, more than a decade went by without a major storm.\n\n\"And a lot of folks started saying, 'look, I know we're doing all this preparation and education. But you know, this costs something, it costs my people time. It costs resources. And we haven't had any storms. Do we really need to keep doing this?'\" Kury said. \"And the Public Service Commission basically said yes, because we're not rescinding the order.\"\n\nAll that work paid off in 2017 when Hurricane Irma, a category 4 storm, hit Florida. After the storm, it took just one day for Florida Power & Light to restore power to half of the 4.4 million customers affected and 10 days to restore power to everyone. That was a dramatic improvement over what it could do before. \"I think that's where the Florida regulator and the Florida utilities have done a really good job,\" Kury said.\n\nHow CenterPoint and Texas stack up\n\nHow does that compare with CenterPoint and the Public Utility Commission of Texas? CenterPoint delivered its resiliency plan to the PUC after being ordered to do so by the Legislature in 2023. Some of it is similar to Florida's. It includes replacing wooden power poles with steel or cement structures and more active vegetation control to reduce the risk of trees falling on power lines. The plan also includes burying power lines at freeway crossings.\n\nBut moving existing power lines underground is expensive, and the solution may not work for much of Houston.\n\n\"If you're more concerned about wind events, falling trees, flying debris, then undergrounding the power lines might be worth the expense,\" Kury said. \"But then you have to understand, now you've made them more vulnerable to flooding and to storm surge. And you just have to be willing to live with that.\"\n\nThat point was highlighted in Florida since category 4 Irma was a wind event. So, its buried lines haven't really been tested by a big flood event like Houston's Hurricane Harvey, which also happened in 2017.\n\nJust how thoroughly Florida's experience can be applied in Texas is uncertain, because the two states have very different regulatory models. While transmission and distribution remain regional monopolies, the state has decentralized and privatized power generation, so that customers choose the company from whom they buy.\n\n\"You have a very different regulatory setup than we do in Florida, where we have these completely vertically integrated utilities, from generation to transmission to distribution,\" said Bradley Marshall, a senior attorney with the Florida office of Earthjustice.\n\nFor now, CenterPoint's resilience plan costs $2.1 billion. The question is who will pay for it? Pat Wood III, now CEO of the Hunt Energy Network, is a former chairman of the PUC and a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\n\"What do we want, and how much are we willing to spend for it?\" Wood said \"So do you want it to be 99.9999% reliable? That's going to be expensive. Do you want it 99% reliable? That's going to be cheaper. Do you want it 95% reliable? That's going to be a whole lot cheaper.\"\n\nEd Hirs, Energy Fellow at the University of Houston, said the big difference between Texas and Florida is that Texas leans toward holding down prices. \"Keep in mind that the Public Utility Commission really doesn't want to approve higher rates, because that reflects back on the governor who appoints them,\" Hirs said.\n\nBut in the days following Beryl, many customers, consumer advocates and politicians have been pushing back. They say ratepayers are already paying more, but the money they're paying hasn't been used effectively.\n\nState Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) singled out one major example. \"After Winter Storm Uri, we put $800 million into large generators which have not been used, or at least by and large not been used,\" Bettencourt said.\" So, you have to make sure you're buying the right technology that can be used, and otherwise, it's just going to sit on the shelf and be paid for by ratepayers.\"\n\nHouston Public Media reached out to CenterPoint, but no one from the company was available to comment for this story.\n\nWho's responsible for what comes next\n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick says that, ultimately, Beryl is the utilities' failure. Last week, he appointed a Senate select committee to make sure CenterPoint and other utilities respond more effectively to future storms. Senator Bettencourt is a member of the committee.\n\n\"It's time that we have a reckoning about it and get this whole utility back on track to do what they're supposed to do,\" Bettencourt said, \"which is be primarily associated with the delivery of power and maintaining of transmission to distribution in their service area.\"\n\nState Senator Carol Alvarado (D-Houston), another member of the committee, said she planned to grill CenterPoint on its proposals to harden its transmission infrastructure and whether the utility failed to plan sufficiently for Beryl's impact. \"Policy-wise, everything is on the table right now,\" Alvarado said. \"It is clear that the status quo is not sustainable.\"\n\nBut Ed Hirs said the PUC and lawmakers need to be looking at themselves.\n\n\"The regulatory compact that the public has with government is (that) they, the elected officials, represent us against the utilities, because you and I are unable to negotiate with CenterPoint for reliability,\" Hirs said. \"The government stands as our representative to make sure we get value for our payments. And Texas has failed in that regard.\"\n\nMany of CenterPoint's frustrated customers agree, particularly given the experience of Winter Storm Uri in 2021.\n\n\"We also lost power during the freeze,\" said Franklin Allaire of Katy, who lost power for the better part of two weeks after Beryl. \"It's, to me, laughable that some of the powers that be are now pointing their finger and wagging their fingers at CenterPoint, which definitely deserves blame. But there's also another, a political side to it where there wasn't the political will to address those infrastructure issues.\"\n\nWhile the Senate select committee meets for the first time on Monday, the PUC has opened its own investigation into CenterPoint and other utilities affected by Beryl. It's expected to issue its final report by December 1.\n\nFormer Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, now the Fellow in Energy and Transportation Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute, expects much of the initial questioning will hinge on CenterPoint's poor communications with its customers during and after Beryl. But he hopes it doesn't stop there.", "source": {"uri": "houstonpublicmedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Public Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_schneider@houstonpublicmedia.org",

But that map went down during May's derecho, and all emergency management officials had to work with during the hurricane was the energy company's outage tracker, which only gives a number indicating how many customers are without power and how many had been restored within 24 hours.\n\n\"We were in the dark,\" OEM spokesperson Brent Taylor told the Chronicle.\n\nCenterPoint initially said it was unable to provide location information on outages to OEM, Taylor said. The energy company eventually provided Houston's emergency management office zip codes where outages were located.\n\nEmergency management officials then used that data to create their own internal outage map to track who was without power, a feat that took half a day's time the Tuesday after the storm and took time away from being able to respond to those in need, Taylor said.\n\nLuckily, the office had a person on hand who was experienced in GIS to get the job done, but creating the map was a process Munoz called \"time consuming,\" \"painstaking\" and a \"resort.\"\n\n\"It's definitely very detrimental to the planning, to the response and to the safety of people,\" Munoz told officials in a Wednesday update to Houston City Council.\n\nCenterPoint officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the height of outages during Beryl, more than 2.26 million CenterPoint customers were without power and CenterPoint consistently failed to provide timely updates about when power would be restored. Some residents turned to a Whataburger app to keep track of power outages instead.\n\nThe same day OEM scrambled to put together its internal outage map, CenterPoint released a live map for residents to track their outage status. Residents voiced concerns about how that CenterPoint map and text updates they were receiving about power restoration weren't entirely accurate.\n\nOEM's plan is to go back to using CenterPoint's outage map once it goes live at the end of August and that the energy company was still a partner they'd continue to work with, Taylor said.\n\nThe state's Public Utility Commission launched an investigation into CenterPoint's outage response and is supposed to provide feedback to state lawmakers and Gov.

As a result, they are now promising to do a better job.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMore than two million customers all across the Houston area were left in the dark after Beryl.

They also questioned whether the company was prepared with enough workers and if their resources were on par with industry standards.\n\nCenterPoint's CEO, Jason Wells agreed that his company has to do better.\n\n\"We know we frustrated our critical facility partners with chaotic communication around restoration times, coordination with when they could expect service, coordination of whether we could provide mobile generator backup,\" Wells said. \"All of that will be immediately streamlined for this hurricane season and we will continue to improve preparation for future storm seasons.\"\n\nWells also insinuated that he inherited many of the company's problems and has been working to improve CenterPoint's operations.\n\n\"We hadn't fully implemented the national management system incident command structure across the company. That was an improvement we put into place in 2023. There's still a lot more work we need to do,\" Wells said.\n\nTexas deaths from Hurricane Beryl climb to at least 36, including more who lost power in heat\n\nMoving forward, Wells promised better communication with customers and the completion of an outage tracker system that will use the smart meters that were installed in many of our homes.\n\n\"The smart meters were useful in our restoration efforts. However, they were not useful to our customers and for that, I apologize\" he said.\n\nWell said the outage tracker map didn't work because it was overwhelmed during the derecho back in May.\n\n\"We are committed to bringing the outage tracker back by August 1. When we do have that outage tracker, it will be providing a benefit.\"\n\nMore Stories Like This In Our Email Newsletter\n\nEmail AddressSign Me Up", "source": {"uri": "click2houston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPRC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_cerota@click2houston.com", "name": "Andy Cerota", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public utilities commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CenterPoint_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CenterPoint Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derecho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smart meter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/HFBYP3B7RZBTZNLKWSGE7DZCKU.jpg?_a=DATAdtfiZAA0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762852", "eventUri": "eng-9762852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2511, "textEnd": 2519}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

While we cannot erase the frustrations and difficulties so many of our customers endured, I and my entire leadership team will not make excuses. We will improve and act with a sense of urgency,\" Wells told the Public Utility Commission of Texas during a meeting in Austin.\n\nBeryl, a Category 1 hurricane, made landfall July 8, knocking out electricity to nearly 3 million people in Texas at the height of the outages. Most of those left without power were in the Houston area. Beryl unleashed heavy rain and winds that uprooted trees and damaged homes and businesses along the Texas Coast and parts of Southeast Texas.\n\nAt Abbott's direction, the utilities commission has begun investigating CenterPoint's preparedness and response to Beryl. A final report is expected by Dec. 1.\n\nA special Texas Senate committee formed to review how utility companies responded to Beryl was set to have its first meeting on Monday in Austin.\n\nDuring Thursday's Public Utility Commission meeting, Wells said CenterPoint's efforts to improve will include better partnerships with local communities and officials, assigning more workers to manage vegetation that could damage power lines, and making lines more resilient to extreme winds.\n\nCenterPoint says it will also have a new cloud-based outage tracker after their previous tracker was removed due to technical difficulties following a May 16 storm that had left about 1 million customers without power. After Beryl hit, some residents tried to determine which areas in Houston had power by using the Texas-based fast food chain Whataburger's app and seeing which of its locations were open.\n\nUtilities commissioners told Wells and other company officials that while they appreciated CenterPoint's desire to be held accountable and to begin regaining the trust of the community, the improvements they were putting in place were things the company should have already been doing.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, actions speak louder than words,\" said Commissioner Lori Cobos. \"So, we need to get through the hurricane season. And that's what needs to happen. And these actions need to be taken. And we hope that you do.\"\n\nThe only speaker during the meeting's public comment section, Houston school district trustee Savant Moore, read the names of the victims from Beryl and asked that the utilities commissioners not forget what Houston and its residents experienced, and criticized CenterPoint's response.\n\n\"I ask what will this board and the governor do to protect Texas lives from such mismanagement?\" Moore said.\n\nJuan A.

Chief Executive Officer Jason Wells told Texas utility regulators Thursday. \"I want to apologize to our customers for the frustration we caused. We will do better.\"\n\nCenterPoint will trim more trees near power lines, improve its customer communications and hire a new executive to coordinate emergency response efforts with local agencies, Wells said during a meeting of the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\nThe hurricane, which cut power to more than 2 million East Texas homes and businesses this month, followed May blackouts triggered by wind storms and fed growing public frustration with CenterPoint. Governor Greg Abbott told Wells in a letter the company had \"lost the faith and trust of Texans\" and demanded it improve preparations for severe weather or face penalties. Texas lawmakers have scheduled legislative hearings next week on the hurricane response.\n\nSeveral of the changes pledged by Wells - including offering backup generation to critical care facilities - were recommended in a 2009 task force report after Hurricane Ike knocked out power to most of Houston.\n\n\"I think it is great that you all came in with a bunch of information as far as what you are going to do next,\" Commissioner Lori Cobos told Wells at Thursday's hearing. \"As far as what I heard, it seemed like things you should have been doing.\"\n\nWells said the company would conduct its own investigation into the storm response and bring in third-party experts to consult on emergency preparedness and communications. He vowed to have a new cloud-based outage map launched by August 1 after its earlier version failed ahead of the hurricane. The utility has nearly doubled its vegetation management workforce to focus on higher-risk areas through the end of the year, he said.\n\nBefore Beryl struck, CenterPoint had asked regulators to approve $2.2 billion in grid resiliency investments. The commission indicated that the utility will need to amend its request in light of the hurricane.\n\n\"I commit that, starting immediately, we will improve our communications with our customers and take specific actions to build the most resilient coastal grid in the country,\" Wells said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

That, they say, could potentially be used to help those with cognitive decline or post-traumatic stress disorder by removing fearful memories while retaining useful ones, such as the sound of a dog's bark.\n\n\"We can use same approach to selectively manipulate only the pathological fear memory while preserving all other adaptive fear memories which are necessary for our daily lives,\" said Jun-Hyeong Cho, co-author of the research from the University of California, Riverside.\n\nThe research is the latest in a string of studies looking at ways to erase unpleasant memories, with previous work by scientists exploring techniques ranging from brain scans and AI to the use of drugs.\n\nPublished in the journal Neuron by Cho and his colleague Woong Bin Kim, the research reveals how the team used genetically modified mice to examine the pathways between the area of the brain involved in processing a particular sound and the area involved in emotional memories, known as the amygdala.\n\n\"These mice are special in that we can label or tag specific pathways that convey certain signals to the amygdala, so that we can identify which pathways are really modified as the mice learn to fear a particular sound,\" said Cho. \"It is like a bundle of phone lines,\" he added. \"Each phone line conveys certain auditory information to the amygdala.\"\n\nIn the first part of the experiment the team played both a high pitched and low-pitched tone to mice. But, when the high-pitched sound was played, the researchers also gave the mice a small electric shock to their feet.\n\nWhen the high-pitched tone was subsequently played on its own, the mice froze in fear; no such response was seen when the alternative, low-pitched, tone was played.\n\nThe team then looked to see if there were differences between the high-pitch and low-pitch tone pathways in the brains of the mice, revealing that, among the mice exposed electric shocks, the connections within the \"high-pitched\" pathway had become stronger, while the other pathway remained unchanged.\n\nThe team found that when mice were subsequently repeatedly exposed to high-pitched sounds without the shocks they lost their fear - a process known as fear extinction.\n\n\"Fear extinction is the psychological basis of exposure therapy used in [treating] post-traumatic stress disorder,\" said Cho. But, he said, \"after exposure therapy, for example two weeks, the fear relapses or recurs spontaneously.\"\n\nThe new research, he adds, offers an explanation: even after fear extinction, the team found the neural pathway for the high-pitched tone remained strengthened in the mice.\n\n\"Fear extinction is not an eraser of fear memory ,\" said Cho. \"It just hides the fear memory transiently.\"\n\nBut the team discovered that using a technique called optogenetics, it was possible to truly erase the unpleasant memories.\n\nThis technique involved the researchers using a virus to introduce genes into particular neurons in the brains of the mice that were involved in the \"high-pitch\" pathways.\n\nOnce inside the cells, the genes result in the production of proteins which respond to light, allowing researchers to control the activity of the neurons.\n\nTaking mice with the fearful memories, the team exposed the neurons involved in the \"high-pitch\" pathway to low-frequency light - an approach which weakens the connections between the neurons.\n\nThe upshot was that the mice no longer appeared fearful when they heard the high-pitched tone.\n\n\"It permanently erases the fear memory,\" said Cho. \"We no longer see the relapse of fear.\"\n\nPeter Giese, professor of neurobiology of mental health at King's College London, said it was too soon to think of using the research to help those with psychopathologies, saying it would be unethical to use optogenetic techniques on people. \"Exactly how this can be applied to humans is a little bit unclear to me,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Giese said the study was a big advance, not only in improving understanding of fear extinction, but also highlighting the importance of the strengthening of connections between neurons in forming memories. What's more, he said, it reveals a way to reverse the process.\n\n\"This is a true erasure of the memory,\" he said.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:59:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.843137264251709, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {"liCnt": 168}, "storyUri": "eng-3370851", "time": "16:59:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370851", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302852", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "score": 5}, {"id": "303005", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303253", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "score": 3}, {"id": "303272", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fear"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear", "score": 5}, {"id": "304132", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "score": 3}, {"id": "304369", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Information"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information", "score": 3}, {"id": "304392", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "score": 2}, {"id": "304534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research", "score": 5}, {"id": "304827", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Protein"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "score": 2}, {"id": "304848", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dog"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "score": 3}, {"id": "305231", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Virus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "score": 2}, {"id": "305285", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "King's College London"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_London", "score": 1}, {"id": "306080", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "score": 1}, {"id": "306512", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mind"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind", "score": 4}, {"id": "309017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gene"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "score": 2}, {"id": "310176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "score": 5}, {"id": "312330", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Extinction"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction", "score": 4}, {"id": "313738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "University of California, Riverside"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Riverside", "score": 3}, {"id": "313913", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "score": 2}, {"id": "314590", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electric shock"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock", "score": 3}, {"id": "315249", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "score": 1}, {"id": "317420", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "score": 3}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=00ec6fecac8781332d8c3a9af9184674", "timeCrawl": "17:11:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Memories of fear could be permanently erased, study shows", "originalArticle": null}

But not all fear memories, such as those in PTSD, are beneficial to our survival. For example, while an extremely fearful response to the sight of a helicopter is not a useful one for a war veteran, a quick reaction to the sound of a gunshot is still desirable. For survivors of car accidents, it would not be beneficial for them to relive the trauma each time they sit in a car.\n\nIn their lab experiments, Jun-Hyeong Cho, M.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and systems biology, and Woong Bin Kim, his postdoctoral researcher, found that fear memory can be manipulated in such a way that some beneficial memories are retained while others, detrimental to our daily life, are suppressed.\n\nThe research, done using a mouse model and published today in Neuron, offers insights into how PTSD and specific phobias may be better treated.\n\nVideo about the research.\n\n\"In the brain, neurons communicate with each other through synaptic connections, in which signals from one neuron are transmitted to another neuron by means of neurotransmitters,\" said Cho, who led the research. \"We demonstrated that the formation of fear memory associated with a specific auditory cue involves selective strengthening in synaptic connections which convey the auditory signals to the amygdala, a brain area essential for fear learning and memory. We also demonstrated that selective weakening of the connections erased fear memory for the auditory cue.\"\n\nIn the lab, Cho and Kim exposed mice to two sounds: a high-pitch tone and a low-pitch tone. Neither tone produced a fear response in the mice. Next, they paired only the high-pitched tone with a mild footshock administered to the mice. Following this, Cho and Kim again exposed the mice to the two tones. To the high-pitch tone (with no accompanying footshock), the mice responded by ceasing all movement, called freezing behavior. The mice showed no such response to the low-pitch sound (with no accompanying footshock). The researchers found that such behavioral training strengthened synaptic connections that relay the high-pitch tone signals to the amygdala.\n\nThe researchers then used a method called optogenetics to weaken the synaptic connection with light, which erased the fear memory for the high-pitch tone.\n\n\"In the brain, neurons receiving the high- and low-pitch tone signals are intermingled,\" said Cho, a member of the Center for Glial-Neuronal Interactions in the UC Riverside School of Medicine. \"We were able, however, to experimentally stimulate just those neurons that responded to the high-pitch sound. Using low-frequency stimulations with light, we were able to erase the fear memory by artificially weakening the connections conveying the signals of the sensory cue -- a high-pitch tone in our experiments - that are associated with the aversive event, namely, the footshock.\"\n\nCho explained that for adaptive fear responses to be developed, the brain must discriminate between different sensory cues and associate only relevant stimuli with aversive events.\n\n\"This study expands our understanding of how adaptive fear memory for a relevant stimulus is encoded in the brain,\" he said. \"It is also applicable to developing a novel intervention to selectively suppress pathological fear while preserving adaptive fear in PTSD.\"\n\nThe researchers note that their method can be adapted for other research, such as \"reward learning\" where stimulus is paired with reward. They plan next to study the mechanisms involved in reward learning which has implications in treating addictive behaviors.\n\n###\n\nThe research, which builds on earlier work by Cho and Kim, was funded by the Initial Complement Funds to Cho from UCR.\n\nThe University of California, Riverside is a doctoral research university, a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California, the state and communities around the world. Reflecting California's diverse culture, UCR's enrollment is now nearly 23,000 students.

Innovative research demonstrates how weakening specific fear-related connections in the brain of a mouse can erase previous fear responses to a stimulus. The work may help to build future treatment programs for post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias.\n\nAs we evolved, swiftly learning to be afraid of dangerous situations or objects was a vital skill. If we are injured by something, our brain forms a memory linking the stimulus to the production of fear, ensuring that we will always avoid it in the future.\n\nThis mechanism works well throughout the animal kingdom; creatures quickly learn what stimuli are dangerous and will, going forward, give them a wide berth.\n\nSometimes, however, a learned fear response is not healthy. For instance, following a car crash, some people have to relive the experience each time they get into a car. Similarly, individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may have disproportionately strong fear responses to certain sights, smells, or sounds.\n\nAlthough medications are available that reduce fear and anxiety across the board, as it stands, it is not possible to target specific stimuli and remove particular fears.\n\nUnderstanding the fear response\n\nRecently, a group of researchers from the University of California, Riverside designed a way to unhitch benign stimuli from their learned fear response. The team was led by Dr. Jun-Hyeong Cho, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and systems biology, and Woong Bin Kim, his postdoctoral researcher.\n\nIn a nutshell, the team wanted to see if they could weaken the connections between the neurons responsible for an inappropriate fear response. The investigation, using a mouse model, was published in the journal Neuron this week.\n\nMice were presented with either a high-pitch or low-pitch tone. At the beginning of the study, the mice showed fear to neither sound. Then, each time the high-pitched sound was played, the mice received a mild electric shock to the feet.\n\nOnce this pairing had been learned, the high-pitch sound elicited a fear response called freezing behavior in the mice, even when no shock was given, while the low-pitch sound continued to produce no fear response. When the brains of the mice were examined, the team found that synaptic connections that relayed the high-pitch sound to the amygdala were strengthened.\n\nDr. Cho explains, \"In the brain, neurons communicate with each other through synaptic connections, in which signals from one neuron are transmitted to another neuron by means of neurotransmitters.\"\n\n\"We demonstrated that the formation of fear memory associated with a specific auditory cue involves selective strengthening in synaptic connections which convey the auditory signals to the amygdala, a brain area essential for fear learning and memory.\"\n\nUsing light to remove fear\n\nIn the next phase of the study, the team wanted to understand whether they could remove or at least reduce this newly learned fear response. They weakened the synaptic connection using a method called optogenetics, which is a procedure wherein genetically modified neurons can be switched on or off by pulses of light.\n\nThe researchers found that the neurons responsible for receiving high- and low-pitch sounds were \"intermingled,\" but they were able to single out just those responsible for responding to the high-pitch sound.\n\n\"We were able [...] to experimentally stimulate just those neurons that responded to the high-pitch sound. Using low-frequency stimulations with light, we were able to erase the fear memory by artificially weakening the connections conveying the signals of the sensory cue - a high-pitch tone in our experiments - that are associated with the aversive event, namely, the foot shock.\"\n\nDr. Jun-Hyeong Cho\n\nThe future of fear\n\nThe findings further our understanding of how adaptive fear memories for a particular stimulus are encoded. Although earlier research has demonstrated that connections between auditory centers and the amygdala are strengthened when an animal forms a fear memory for an auditory cue, this study had some unexpected results.\n\nMedical News Today recently spoke with Dr. Cho, and he explained, \"We were surprised when we found that only a small population of neurons (nerve cells) in these areas were involved in the formation of fear memory for a specific auditory cue.\"\n\nOf course, the findings are fascinating, but the results are unlikely to be usable in humans for some time. When MNT asked Dr. Cho how long it might take, he said, \"Based on recent advances in technology to control neural activity in humans (such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation), we expect that we will be able to weaken pathological and maladaptive fear memories in PTSD within the next 10 years.\"\n\nAs with any complex area of research, there are plenty of questions that need answers. Dr. Cho told MNT about his future plans, saying that, \"as we discovered the neural mechanism of the formation of fear memory associated with a sensory (auditory) cue, we plan next to investigate how fear memory associated with a context is encoded in the brain.\"\n\nThey will also investigate \"how a memory associated with a reward cue is encoded in the brain, which has implications in treating addictive behaviors.\" PTSD and phobias are notoriously difficult to treat, and this line of research gives some much-needed hope.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T09:44:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {"gpCnt": 3, "liCnt": 3}, "storyUri": "eng-3370851", "time": "09:44:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370851", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Animal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal", "score": 3}, {"id": "302689", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "score": 3}, {"id": "302852", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "score": 5}, {"id": "302854", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Human"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "score": 2}, {"id": "303005", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "score": 3}, {"id": "303272", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fear"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear", "score": 5}, {"id": "304378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Behavior"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior", "score": 3}, {"id": "304534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research", "score": 3}, {"id": "305138", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "score": 4}, {"id": "307506", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sound"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound", "score": 5}, {"id": "307803", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Learning"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning", "score": 4}, {"id": "308686", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nervous system"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system", "score": 1}, {"id": "308687", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "score": 2}, {"id": "310176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "score": 5}, {"id": "313322", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (physiology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)", "score": 5}, {"id": "313738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "University of California, Riverside"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Riverside", "score": 3}, {"id": "313913", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "score": 2}, {"id": "314590", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electric shock"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock", "score": 3}, {"id": "318291", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "score": 5}, {"id": "318298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Posttraumatic stress disorder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder", "score": 5}, {"id": "320210", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Memory"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory", "score": 5}], "image": "https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/319/319014/scared-man-s-eyes.jpg", "timeCrawl": "09:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Fears erased with pulses of light", "originalArticle": null}

a high-pitch tone in our experiments - that are associated with the aversive event, namely, the footshock.'\n\nDr Cho explained that for adaptive fear responses to be developed, the brain must discriminate between different sensory cues and associate only relevant stimuli with aversive events.\n\nHe added: 'This study expands our understanding of how adaptive fear memory for a relevant stimulus is encoded in the brain.\n\n'It is also applicable to developing a novel intervention to selectively suppress pathological fear while preserving adaptive fear in PTSD.'", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:32:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370851", "time": "16:32:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370851", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302677", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "score": 3}, {"id": "302852", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "score": 5}, {"id": "303272", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fear"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear", "score": 5}, {"id": "307506", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sound"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound", "score": 5}, {"id": "310176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "score": 5}, {"id": "311563", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "score": 3}, {"id": "313465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "score": 4}, {"id": "313738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "University of California, Riverside"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Riverside", "score": 3}, {"id": "313913", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "score": 1}, {"id": "316296", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "score": 1}, {"id": "318291", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "score": 5}, {"id": "318298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Posttraumatic stress disorder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder", "score": 5}, {"id": "320210", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Memory"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory", "score": 5}, {"id": "349744", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Amygdala"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala", "score": 5}, {"id": "354921", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Synapse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse", "score": 5}, {"id": "358863", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neurotransmitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "463243", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Optogenetics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics", "score": 3}, {"id": "594637", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Specific phobia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_phobia", "score": 5}, {"id": "845059", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fear conditioning"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_conditioning", "score": 3}], "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/17/10/4352AEA200000578-0-image-a-2_1502962671027.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Incredible technique allows scientists to erase particular memories", "originalArticle": null}

But Jun-Hyeong Cho, a professor of cell biology and neuroscience and postdoctoral researcher Woong Bin Kim hope the work they are doing can one day be used on humans, particularly those who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or crippling phobias.\n\nTheir work is one of a string of recent studies in which different techniques have been used to erase brain memory. Cho and Kim's experiment is different in that they used light to trigger the process.\n\nIn a paper in the current issue of Neuron magazine, the two outline a study in which lab mice were trained to recognize two sounds, one a high-frequency sound, the other a low-frequency sound. The high-frequency sound was paired with a mild electrical shock, so that the mice learned to fear the tone, even when no shock was given.\n\nPrior to the training, the brains of the mice were genetically altered in a way that made their high-frequency auditory neurons react to stimulation by blue light. A thin tube with a 2 mm fiber optic emitter was surgically implanted near those neurons. When that light was turned on, the neurons would fire.\n\nWhen a memory is formed, new connections between neurons are formed. This takes place at the synapse, the space between the neurons where neurotransmitters flow from one cell to another. The neurons receiving the neurotransmitters form receptors for those chemicals. The stronger the memory, the more receptors are formed.\n\nIn the case of the fear memory in the mice, Cho and Kim were looking at the neural pathway between the auditory center and the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear responses.\n\nThey repeatedly stimulated the neurons that triggered the fear of high-pitched sound, but did so with a low frequency of stimulation. Lower stimulation, Cho said, actually weakens a memory. Fewer neurotransmitters are released and receptors specific to the memory begin to disappear. After a period of time, the mice no longer showed fear when the high-pitch neurons were stimulated. The memory was gone.\n\nScientifically erasing memory may remind some people of the 2004 film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" in which characters played by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet elect to erase the memories of their relationship and painful breakup. Cho said he is familiar with the movie.\n\n\"Five to 10 years ago, the manipulation of memory was science fiction,\" he said. \"But now it's not.\"\n\nWhile he says science is just knowledge, he did admit that he has concerns about how the techniques being developed might eventually be used.\n\n\"There are a lot of ethical issues,\" he said. \"We all consider whether this would be eventually beneficial to the society. We don't want a situation such as 'Total Recall,'\" the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi thriller that revolves around implanted memories.\n\nHe also realizes that not all negative memories are bad.\n\n\"If we have a bad memory and it makes us avoid that thing in the future, that's a good thing,\" he said. \"That's adaptive learning.\"\n\nDebilitating, or pathological, memories, however, are not helpful, he said. He sees many potential benefits in being able to erase memory, such as possible treatments for mental illness, Alzheimer's disease and PTSD.\n\nThe current standard treatment for PTSD is desensitization through repeated recall of the memory -- in a way similar to the low-level stimulation given to the mice in the UCR study. But Cho said research has shown that the weakened memories rebound after treatment.\n\n\"Normally, two to three weeks after (therapy) it relapses,\" Cho said. \"That's why we think experiential therapy is very frustrating\" for some patients.\n\nWith the technique he and Kim used, they didn't see that problem.\n\n\"In our case, we did not observe a relapse of fear,\" he said.\n\nPsychological conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder have been treated as problems with the chemical balance in the brain in recent years. Cho said about 30 percent of patients don't respond to drugs such as Prozac. He thinks physical mechanisms may be involved.\n\n\"It could be a neural circuitry problem,\" he said. If the specific neurons can be identified, he added, \"We can artificially manipulate the strength of that connection to (potentially) relieve the symptoms.\"\n\nReversing the procedure, where added stimulation of neurons could help strengthen memories, might benefit patients with Alzheimer's or dementia, he said.\n\nHaving shown he can erase memory, Cho said he wants to explore going in the other direction.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T09:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370851", "time": "09:11:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370851", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302505", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "score": 3}, {"id": "302541", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Science"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science", "score": 3}, {"id": "302812", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "score": 3}, {"id": "302814", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Film"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "score": 3}, {"id": "302852", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "score": 4}, {"id": "302854", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Human"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "score": 3}, {"id": "303005", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "score": 4}, {"id": "303152", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Light"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light", "score": 5}, {"id": "303252", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major depressive disorder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder", "score": 1}, {"id": "303272", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fear"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear", "score": 5}, {"id": "304392", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "score": 1}, {"id": "304534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research", "score": 2}, {"id": "304855", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "score": 2}, {"id": "306084", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "score": 2}, {"id": "306085", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fluoxetine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine", "score": 1}, {"id": "307590", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "score": 5}, {"id": "313738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "University of California, Riverside"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Riverside", "score": 4}, {"id": "313913", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "score": 5}, {"id": "314971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "score": 2}, {"id": "315249", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "score": 4}, {"id": "319564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger", "score": 2}, {"id": "327082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kate Winslet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Winslet", "score": 2}, {"id": "467100", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jim Carey (ice hockey)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carey_(ice_hockey)", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.pe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0817_nws_rpe-l-fear-001_24339425.jpg?w=640", "timeCrawl": "16:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "UC Riverside scientists erase fear in mice, hope to help humans one day", "originalArticle": null}

The Guardian reports: Published in the journal Neuron by Cho and his colleague Woong Bin Kim, the research reveals how the team used genetically modified mice to examine the pathways between the area of the brain involved in processing a particular sound and the area involved in emotional memories, known as the amygdala. In the first part of the experiment the team played both a high pitched and low-pitched tone to mice. But, when the high-pitched sound was played, the researchers also gave the mice a small electric shock to their feet. When the high-pitched tone was subsequently played on its own, the mice froze in fear; no such response was seen when the alternative, low-pitched, tone was played. The team then looked to see if there were differences between the high-pitch and low-pitch tone pathways in the brains of the mice, revealing that, among the mice exposed electric shocks, the connections within the \"high-pitched\" pathway had become stronger, while the other pathway remained unchanged. The team found that when mice were subsequently repeatedly exposed to high-pitched sounds without the shocks they lost their fear -- a process known as fear extinction.\n\nBut the team discovered that using a technique called optogenetics, it was possible to truly erase the unpleasant memories. This technique involved the researchers using a virus to introduce genes into particular neurons in the brains of the mice that were involved in the \"high-pitch\" pathways.

There's also scope for it to perform the inverse function, and strengthen particular memories.\n\nThe research from University of California, Riverside, published in the journal Neuron, first involved studying the creation of fearful memories in the area of the brain involved in the experiencing of emotions - the amygdala. The scientists did this by exposing the mice to high and low-pitched sounds. When the high-pitch sound was heard, the mice were given an electric shock to their feet. No shocks were administered when the low-pitched sound was played.\n\nThe scientists found that when the high-pitched sound was subsequently played without the shock, the mice would freeze in fear. No reaction was recorded when the low-pitched sound was played, and an investigation into brains' of the mice found that - amongst those exposed to electric shocks - specific auditory pathways had become stronger.\n\n\"These mice are special in that we can label or tag specific pathways that convey certain signals to the amygdala, so that we can identify which pathways are really modified as the mice learn to fear a particular sound,\" Jun-Hyeong Cho, co-author of the research, told The Guardian, adding: \"It is like a bundle of phone lines [...] Each phone line conveys certain auditory information to the amygdala.\"\n\nNext, the researchers repeatedly played high-frequency sounds without the shock, and noticed that the mice stopped showing signs of fear. This technique, known as fear extinction, is the basis of exposure therapy - used to treat PTSD and phobias. One criticism of exposure therapy is that inured fears can relapse a few weeks after treatment, and the scientists indeed noted that neural pathways for high-pitched sounds in the mice remained strengthened - even though they'd stopped showing surface-level signs of fear.\n\nThe scientists went on to use a technique called optogenetics, which has previously been used to research treatments to degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Optogenetics involves introducing a genetically modified virus into the brain of a subject, which is able to \"infect\" certain classes of neurons with a light-sensitive receptor. In effect, this allows scientists to control the activity of those neurons by exposing them to light.\n\nIn this case, Cho and his colleague Woong Bin Kim were able to use optogenetics to weaken the connection between neurons involved in the fearful association toward high-frequency sounds, essentially erasing the negative memory. After the procedure, the mice no longer appeared fearful of high-pitched sounds, and there was no relapse.\n\nGiven the limited scope of the experiment, it may be too soon to tell how this method could be applied to human subjects suffering from a complex range of traumas. There are also questions about whether such a technique would be appropriate from an ethical standpoint, let alone an existential one. Do we want to be able to permanently erase our fears?

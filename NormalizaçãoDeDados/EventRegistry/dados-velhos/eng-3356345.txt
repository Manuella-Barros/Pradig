The reality star's ensemble had a super low-cut neckline, allowing her to put her cleavage on full display, and Tristan could not peel his eyes away. Kim Kardashian, 36, must've noticed he was staring, because she sneakily snapped a photo of the pair...and the basketball star's eyes were fixated right on Khloe's breasts! The 36-year-old made sure to point out that she noticed Tristan's gaze, too, because she put a pair of 'shifty eye' emojis on top of his real lids. LOL!\n\nIn the photo, Khloe showed affection in her own way by resting her arm on Tristan's lap. She also uploaded some Snapchats from the party, and in one video, Tristan gave her a sweet kiss on the forehead, and then she turned around and returned the favor with a peck on the lips. Awww! The lovebirds have been together a lot lately, and since basketball is currently out of season, he's been logging plenty of time in L.A. It's been almost a year since these two confirmed their romance by flaunting PDA in Cabo last September, and things definitely seem to be on the fast track toward an engagement!\n\nOf course, while we're loving the love between Khloe and Tristan, last night was really all about Kylie, whose birthday is Aug. 10. Before the party, Kylie attended her boyfriend, Travis Scott's, concert, and he was on-hand afterward to join in on the celebration, as well. Of course, Kendall Jenner, 21, and Kris Jenner, 61, were there, too, although Kourtney Kardashian, 38, couldn't make it (she's currently in Egypt with her man, Younes Bendjima).\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Tristan and Khloe will get engaged anytime soon?", "timeCrawl": "12:24:00", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1356, "date": "2017-08-10", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1363}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8392398", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "id": 3, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "id": 231, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "id": 273, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Eye_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Eye Disorders", "id": 997, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "id": 998, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Vision", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Vision", "id": 999, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Khlo\u00e9 says: 'She never said I was fat, but I knew she was referring to my size. Words are the weapon we have: they cut the deepest.'\n\nKhlo\u00e9 lost 40 lb after splitting from her husband, basketball star Lamar Odom, in 2013, but says even when she was a size 18, she never considered herself fat.\n\n'I don't like the term plus size': Reality TV royalty and businesswoman Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian on self-belief, body image and why family always comes first\n\nByElaine Lipworth For You Magazine\n\nShe may be one of the world's most famous reality-TV brood, but it's KHLOE KARDASHIAN's understanding of what 'normal' women want, plus old-fashioned business sense, that have seen her denim brand hit a multimillion-dollar bottom line\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian is known as the most relatable member of her famous family - and the reality TV star, bestselling author and entrepreneur lives up to that reputation in person. I've met her before and when I arrive at her house (which used to belong to Justin Bieber), hidden away in an exclusive gated community outside Los Angeles, she bounds over to greet me, all smiles and hugs. Her bright kitchen overlooks a beautifully manicured lawn with kumquat trees and a swimming pool. Her black labrador Gabbana is lolling in the sunshine, and amid the luxury there are homely touches, such as collages by her nieces and nephews decorating the fridge.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, once the target of cruel online attacks about her weight, looks super sleek, flaunting those famous Kardashian curves\n\nIt's 9am and Khlo\u00e9 has been up since 4.30, driving 25 miles to a Beverly Hills gym to film a dawn exercise session for the upcoming 14th season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the phenomenally successful show chronicling the lives of the entire clan: Khlo\u00e9, her elder sisters Kim and Kourtney, her brother Rob and her half-sisters Kylie and Kendall.\n\n'People probably think we sleep all day,' laughs Khlo\u00e9, but she inherited a rigorous work ethic from her late father, businessman and lawyer Robert Kardashian (who was on O J Simpson's defence team in his murder trial), and her industrious mother, the Kardashian clan's manager Kris Jenner. Her parents divorced when she was six and Kris went on to marry Olympic athlete Bruce - now Caitlyn - Jenner.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, once the target of cruel online attacks about her weight, looks super sleek, flaunting those famous Kardashian curves in black Nike leggings. She lost 40lb after splitting up with her husband, the troubled former basketball player Lamar Odom, in 2013 (for the past year she has been dating 26-year-old Canadian basketball player Tristan Thompson) and now has 68.5 million Instagram followers and her own TV show Revenge Body.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 lost 40lb after splitting up with her husband, the troubled former basketball player Lamar Odom, in 2013\n\nFor her latest venture, she has created a denim line with British businesswoman Emma Grede. Good American jeans are marketed as a 'revolution' because they come in sizes from double zero to 24. When the brand launched in the US last autumn, it made $1 million on the first day (a record for a denim label). This month Khlo\u00e9 and Emma are expanding their range with a new line of Good American Sweats tracksuits.\n\nHere, Khlo\u00e9 discusses everything from body image to why family always comes first.\n\nWhen I was younger I never wore jeans because I was too embarrassed. I would go shopping with my sisters and the [sales assistants] would say, 'Oh, we don't stock your size here.' It was mortifying. Just because you're bigger or curvier, it doesn't mean you don't want to be stylish.\n\nCOOL FOR KHLOE\n\nWhat did you have for breakfast? Eggs and avocado on toast. After I work out, I have a protein shake. I love to eat.\n\nGO-TO designer I like Yeezy, Kanye West's line. It fits the female form spectacularly and I love its simplicity.\n\nFavourite item in your wardrobe A very expensive turquoise Birkin. It is so bright, it makes me happy.\n\nThe Book that changed your life? Embraced by the Light by Betty J Eadie. It's about a woman who had a near-death experience. It made me feel comfortable with death when I was young. Nicole Brown Simpson, my mum's best friend [O J Simpson's ex-wife], was murdered when I was nearly ten. It was my first experience of death and this book gave me such peace. It also helped me when my father died.\n\nAdvice to your teenage self You have your whole life to be old and just a few years to be young, so enjoy your youth. Be 21, make mistakes.\n\nWho makes you laugh? My sister Kourtney. We have a fun, silly bond.\n\nMotto If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. We can plan the rest of our life, but it doesn't mean it will go that way. Pay attention to now!\n\nGood American jeans are all about empowerment. We cut them to fit a fuller figure, rather than straight up and down. We decided we would not sell in a department store unless they took the collection in all sizes. We hope to break down barriers.\n\nI experienced body shaming in high school. My sisters and I went to a girls' private school and when I started, aged 13, the teacher read out my name and said 'Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian... Are you related to Kourtney and Kim?' I said, 'Yes, they're my sisters.' She said, 'Are you sure?' She never said I was fat, but I knew she was referring to my size. Words are the best weapon we have; they cut the deepest and they last for ever.\n\nI don't like the term plus size. Why point out that someone is bigger than someone else? I'm a [British] size 8 to 10 now, and at my biggest I was a 16 to 18, but I never considered myself fat. I don't mean you should be 400lb [28\u00bdst], eating bags of crisps and saying, 'Oh, I'm just big,' but you could be size 24, work out and be healthy.\n\nMy sisters wear Good American jeans and my mum loves them, which makes me feel good because they're hard to please. They're supportive, but they wouldn't wear them if they didn't like them.\n\nMy father was incredibly wealthy. We had a mansion in Beverly Hills and Rolls-Royces. My parents would have extravagant parties. We had ponies and Ferris wheels. It was a beautiful life. My dad had grown up poor; he was self-made and proud of that, as he should have been. He was a smart man. But he was also strict: we would go to feed the homeless on Skid Row, and he didn't believe in giving us money. None of us had credit cards when we were teenagers, even though all our friends did.\n\nMy dad believed you have to work for every dollar. So from 14 we had to get summer jobs. I worked in his office as an assistant and in a clothing store, but because I was only 14, I wasn't allowed to be on the cash register and I had to clean the back rooms and the toilets instead. My dad was also strict about us being close as a family and instilling strong values. We had dinner together every night; those traditions make you who you are later in life.\n\nThe klan (from left) Kris, Khlo\u00e9, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Caitlyn, Kim's daughter North and Kylie in 2016\n\nI was 19 when my father died [of oesophageal cancer, aged 59]. It was very stressful, everyone was figuring out their grief and we were lost. I think I was in denial. A lot of my hair fell out - I think it was because I internalised my emotions. It was hard not to have him there. I was really angry. It helped when I started talking about it, but it took me three years just to understand and accept it.\n\nWe didn't get one dollar when he died. We got no inheritance, not his home or his cars or anything. I was working for him at the time and his company got taken away so I didn't have a job, and it was a lot to process at one time. I don't think people realise that none of us had trust funds. I got evicted from my apartment because I couldn't pay my rent, so I moved in with Kourtney and we started Dash [a chain of boutiques] together. Financially, that was a good learning experience for a 19-year-old - to know that when you're getting a pay cheque, you can't just spend it all!\n\nMy sisters bossed me around when I was younger. I was the only employee in our store for three years, so when they got asked to go somewhere cool, I was the one stuck behind. When we were younger we were jealous of one another, but not in a malicious way.\n\nThere is no rivalry between us now. We all have our own identities. Kendall and I were exercising this morning, and I asked, 'When was the last time you worked out?' And she said, 'A few weeks ago.' And I'm, like, 'Ugh, it's not fair!' because she is a supermodel with a perfect body! But [the banter] is playful and we come from a place of two heads are better than one, and three are better than two. Why would I not want to share my success with my family?\n\nMy mum was 22 when she married my dad, who was 12 years older than her. She didn't have to work and she was with us all the time, but she learned so much from my dad. When she divorced him and married Bruce [now Caitlyn] Jenner, she revitalised Bruce's career. My mum is so confident and powerful.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 with (from left) Kourtney, Kris and Rob in 2012\n\nWe're successful as a family because my mother has always believed in us. She would sit in meetings in front of the highest executives and say, 'My children can do X, Y and Z.' People ask, 'Is it hard having your mother as a manager?' And I say, 'Of course it is.' We are constantly together and sometimes it's difficult to differentiate a business deal from a family thing. But no other manager would believe in us like our mother does.\n\nMy boyfriend is very protective of me. Feeling loved and validated and secure is a huge thing. Tristan is protective of my entire family, which is beautiful. And I love that everything we do is as a union. When he speaks, it's 'us' and 'we,' and that's important because it shows that you're sharing life. The best thing is that we're able to communicate about anything, and I think a lot of relationships don't flourish because people are afraid to voice their opinion, not wanting to rock the boat.\n\nI love to cook, and Tristan loves everything I make. But I don't think men realise how long things take. I make dishes from scratch, and he'll be, like, 'Can you make me an apple pie?' I say, 'Do you know how long it takes?' He loves Cinnabons [cinnamon rolls], so I learned how to make them by watching a YouTube video. I ended up teaching my mum to make them, too.\n\nIt's good to find someone who has the same belief system and morals as you because it makes things easy. Tristan and I are both Christians; we go to church, we pray, we're vocal about God and spirituality. A lot of my girlfriends get pregnant without talking about things such as religion with their significant others and then find they have different belief systems to them.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 now has 68.5 million Instagram followers and her own TV show Revenge Body\n\nI definitely want a family, but I don't feel any pressure. Tristan is a great dad [he has an eight-month-old son with his previous partner] and he definitely wants more children, but we both feel that it will happen when the time is right. We're still in a new relationship and I love us having time together. Once you have kids you can't get back your non-kid years. My sisters and I bother my mum all the time, so I know it's not, like, 'When they're 18, you don't worry about them again.' You worry about your children for the rest of your life. The concern I have is raising little human beings in a world that's filled with such hate and terror. That seems very scary.\n\nI'm in the best relationship I've ever been in and it doesn't take a ring for me to feel that way. I believe in marriage and I want to be married again one day but I don't have a time frame. Why do people think that marriage equates to happiness? There are a lot of people in unhealthy marriages.\n\nMy house is the fun house for my nieces and nephews. We do arts and crafts and bake a lot. We like to play outside and in the pool, just being goofy. I have water balloons and we have water fights. I'm like a big kid myself. At night when I babysit them we have dance parties. I love to give their mums the evening off.\n\nThe worst thing that happened to us in the past year was Kim's robbery [in a gunpoint hold-up at her private hotel in Paris last October, Kim was robbed of jewellery]. But I'm also grateful that she wasn't physically hurt. I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and it was almost like God's way of saying, 'We need to teach you guys to be more aware of security' and also, 'This can all be gone in an instant so always tell one another you love them - no matter what.' The robbery was a huge wake-up call for our entire family. I really hate it when people say, 'Oh, it was Kim's fault. She was too flashy.' I could show you hundreds of people on Instagram who show off wads of cash and diamonds.\n\nThe best thing that has happened this year was meeting my niece Dream, my brother Rob's baby [with Blac Chyna]. She looks exactly like him. I melt when I see him with her because he's a phenomenal father, just like my dad was.\n\nI think the show has kept our family close. When people get older, most go their separate ways, they're busy with their own families. I see my family almost every day. Will I be sad when the show ends? Yes, because it will be the end of an era - not because I won't be on TV. I have so many other businesses that I would love to indulge in that I don't have enough time for now. But it will be bittersweet. I'm beyond grateful for everything the show has given me, but mostly for the bond with my family.\n\nI have a fascination with the Kennedy family. I'm intrigued by their dynamic and their unity. Even after John F Kennedy was assassinated, I love how Jackie was still so connected to her in-laws. What I respect is their love and loyalty to one another - it's something I relate to. It reminds me of the bond we have in our family. Also, they received a lot of unfair media reports, but they have always held their heads high.\n\nWhen you have money, it's easy to buy things for people, but that doesn't mean you're there for them. I've helped people pay off their mortgages, paid for their children's schools, their medical bills... But as corny as it sounds, the nicest thing you can give is your time, like being with friends who are going through divorce, listening to them. I've sat in hospital rooms with people for endless hours. I believe the kindest thing I can give is my empathy and my love.\n\nI wouldn't change my family for anything. People might look at us and be, like, 'Oh God. There are so many of them and there's always drama!' But there's drama within any family. I know people who only have one brother and they don't talk to each other. I'm so blessed. I talk to my brothers and sisters every single day. We are family by blood, but we're friends by choice. It's not a requirement. My family is the best.\n\nGood American Sweats will be available worldwide from Thursday from goodamerican.com\n\nIT'S ALL IN THE JEANS\n\nKhlo\u00e9 with Good American co-founder Emma Grede\n\nBy Good American co-founder Emma Grede\n\nKhlo\u00e9 is really involved with everything: from design to fabric colours. She is a proper business partner; she and I speak absolutely every day. She is super hands-on and a normal girl.\n\nOur jeans are made for a proper woman's body - for hips and a bottom. We use premium fabric, which has great recovery, so you don't have to wash the jeans every time you wear them. Khlo\u00e9 and I spend months wear-testing everything. Bella Hadid said they were her favourite jeans ever!\n\nOur bestseller is the Good Waist style, which are really high-waisted skinny jeans in a basic blue. It's a flattering cut because most people have decent ankles, but I'm praying that proper flares come back in - a real 70s revival. I love them, but I'll have a problem getting Khlo\u00e9 to try them; she wouldn't be seen dead in flares!\n\nGood Sweats are different [to most casual wear] because they are sexy. You don't look like you just put on a potato sack!\n\nI'm proud of Good American because of our inclusive sizing and super-diversity. On our website you'll see a beautiful classic blonde bombshell model as well as somebody a little bit more boyish, because women are not cookie-cutter shapes - we're all different. We're all about fully embracing that.\n\nEmma has worked with leading designers including Vivienne Westwood and Zac Posen and specialised in celebrity fashion partnerships, brokering deals such as Natalie Portman's collaboration with Dior.", "timeCrawl": "00:39:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8858572", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "id": 180, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "id": 244, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "id": 289, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "id": 594, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "id": 1032, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Despite the unnecessary comments from her critics, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star transformed her body by eating healthy and working out regularly. However, Kylie Jenner revealed that her sister stopped using one particular add-on to her food that helped her shed off pounds.\n\nAfter her nasty divorce from Lamar Odom, Khloe Kardashian revealed that she uses her time now to focus more on taking care of herself.\n\nThe girlfriend of Tristan Thompson is not one to shy away from flaunting her amazing weight loss by wearing clothes that compliment her curves. Khloe Kardashian launched her Good American jeans last year but she just recently added bodysuits to the collection. Not only did the 33-year-old television personality help promote the line by sharing her brand new non-denim addition on social media, she modeled a couple of the designs as well.\n\nAlthough the reality star obviously lost a lot of weight, she made sure that her Good American bodysuits will also accommodate curvy women. The line goes up to size 24 and Khloe Kardashian shared a photo of her and three other women with different body types, calling them her beautiful \"good squad.\"\n\nThere is no secret in losing weight. One must add exercise to their daily routine and eat fruits and vegetables as much as possible -- Khloe Kardashian did just that. Her journey to her new sexy body has been documented in their hit reality television series, where the star will mostly be seen working out with a trainer and eating her salads.\n\nMeanwhile, when Kylie Jenner was previously asked about her weight loss, the youngest of the Kardashian/Jenner clan revealed more than just her secrets. The 20-year-old Kylie Lip Kit mogul spilled one of Khloe Kardashian's shocking discoveries about herself.\n\n\"She was allergic to coconut oil and she was cooking everything with coconut oil. So then she stopped that and then she like, lost all the water weight. She's doing really great.\"\n\nCoconut is everywhere these days.

Even in high school, the reality star's own teachers would make snarky comments about her weight and 'body shamed' her!\n\nIt's hard to imagine a time when Khloe Kardashian, 33, was picked apart for her looks. The Good American designer has the face of an angel, the ass of a stripper (in a good way), and the workout discipline of a personal trainer. Unfortunately, some of her high school teachers didn't think so many years ago. They would often compare her to her \"skinnier\" sisters, Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, and couldn't believe that Khloe was related because of her \"size.\" Speaking of one teacher in particular, the Revenge Body hostess revealed, \"She never said I was fat, but I knew she was referring to my size,\" to the Daily Mail. \"Words are the weapon we have: they cut the deepest.\"\n\nLook, Khloe will be the first to tell you that she used to be the \"ugly duckling\" in her family, but that doesn't make bullying okay. Especially from a mentor! They should know better! The blonde beauty has lost 40 pounds since divorcing Lamar Odom, and that number appears to be increasing with each workout session. As hard as it may be to ignore the haters, Khloe should feel incredibly proud of her body. We love it, and boyfriend Tristan Thompson loves it. The Cleveland Cavaliers star has been caught on multiple occasions checking out her curves.\n\nAt dinner, Kim caught the baller STARING at her sister's chest. It was so obvious that she took a picture and added a pair of eye emojis over his face. Who could blame him for looking, though? Khloe was dressed to impress in a super revealing top with a plunging neckline that went all the way down past her boobs. Eat your heart -- I mean, your eyes out, Tristan.\n\nHollywoodLifers, can you relate to Khloe's bullying story?

I've met her before and when I arrive at her house (which used to belong to Justin Bieber), hidden away in an exclusive gated community outside Los Angeles, she bounds over to greet me, all smiles and hugs. Her bright kitchen overlooks a beautifully manicured lawn with kumquat trees and a swimming pool. Her black labrador Gabbana is lolling in the sunshine, and amid the luxury there are homely touches, such as collages by her nieces and nephews decorating the fridge.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, once the target of cruel online attacks about her weight, looks super sleek, flaunting those famous Kardashian curves\n\nIt's 9am and Khlo\u00e9 has been up since 4.30, driving 25 miles to a Beverly Hills gym to film a dawn exercise session for the upcoming 14th season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the phenomenally successful show chronicling the lives of the entire clan: Khlo\u00e9, her elder sisters Kim and Kourtney, her brother Rob and her half-sisters Kylie and Kendall.\n\n'People probably think we sleep all day,' laughs Khlo\u00e9, but she inherited a rigorous work ethic from her late father, businessman and lawyer Robert Kardashian (who was on O J Simpson's defence team in his murder trial), and her industrious mother, the Kardashian clan's manager Kris Jenner. Her parents divorced when she was six and Kris went on to marry Olympic athlete Bruce - now Caitlyn - Jenner.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, once the target of cruel online attacks about her weight, looks super sleek, flaunting those famous Kardashian curves in black Nike leggings. She lost 40lb after splitting up with her husband, the troubled former basketball player Lamar Odom, in 2013 (for the past year she has been dating 26-year-old Canadian basketball player Tristan Thompson) and now has 68.5 million Instagram followers and her own TV show Revenge Body.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 lost 40lb after splitting up with her husband, the troubled former basketball player Lamar Odom, in 2013\n\nFor her latest venture, she has created a denim line with British businesswoman Emma Grede. Good American jeans are marketed as a 'revolution' because they come in sizes from double zero to 24. When the brand launched in the US last autumn, it made $1 million on the first day (a record for a denim label). This month Khlo\u00e9 and Emma are expanding their range with a new line of Good American Sweats tracksuits.\n\nHere, Khlo\u00e9 discusses everything from body image to why family always comes first.\n\nWhen I was younger I never wore jeans because I was too embarrassed. I would go shopping with my sisters and the [sales assistants] would say, 'Oh, we don't stock your size here.' It was mortifying. Just because you're bigger or curvier, it doesn't mean you don't want to be stylish.\n\nCOOL FOR KHLOE\n\nWhat did you have for breakfast? Eggs and avocado on toast. After I work out, I have a protein shake. I love to eat.\n\nGO-TO designer I like Yeezy, Kanye West's line. It fits the female form spectacularly and I love its simplicity.\n\nFavourite item in your wardrobe A very expensive turquoise Birkin. It is so bright, it makes me happy.\n\nThe Book that changed your life? Embraced by the Light by Betty J Eadie. It's about a woman who had a near-death experience. It made me feel comfortable with death when I was young. Nicole Brown Simpson, my mum's best friend [O J Simpson's ex-wife], was murdered when I was nearly ten. It was my first experience of death and this book gave me such peace. It also helped me when my father died.\n\nAdvice to your teenage self You have your whole life to be old and just a few years to be young, so enjoy your youth. Be 21, make mistakes.\n\nWho makes you laugh? My sister Kourtney. We have a fun, silly bond.\n\nMotto If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. We can plan the rest of our life, but it doesn't mean it will go that way. Pay attention to now!\n\nGood American jeans are all about empowerment. We cut them to fit a fuller figure, rather than straight up and down. We decided we would not sell in a department store unless they took the collection in all sizes. We hope to break down barriers.\n\nI experienced body shaming in high school. My sisters and I went to a girls' private school and when I started, aged 13, the teacher read out my name and said 'Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian... Are you related to Kourtney and Kim?' I said, 'Yes, they're my sisters.' She said, 'Are you sure?' She never said I was fat, but I knew she was referring to my size. Words are the best weapon we have; they cut the deepest and they last for ever.\n\nI don't like the term plus size. Why point out that someone is bigger than someone else? I'm a [British] size 8 to 10 now, and at my biggest I was a 16 to 18, but I never considered myself fat. I don't mean you should be 400lb [28\u00bdst], eating bags of crisps and saying, 'Oh, I'm just big,' but you could be size 24, work out and be healthy.\n\nMy sisters wear Good American jeans and my mum loves them, which makes me feel good because they're hard to please. They're supportive, but they wouldn't wear them if they didn't like them.\n\nMy father was incredibly wealthy. We had a mansion in Beverly Hills and Rolls-Royces. My parents would have extravagant parties. We had ponies and Ferris wheels. It was a beautiful life. My dad had grown up poor; he was self-made and proud of that, as he should have been. He was a smart man. But he was also strict: we would go to feed the homeless on Skid Row, and he didn't believe in giving us money. None of us had credit cards when we were teenagers, even though all our friends did.\n\nMy dad believed you have to work for every dollar. So from 14 we had to get summer jobs. I worked in his office as an assistant and in a clothing store, but because I was only 14, I wasn't allowed to be on the cash register and I had to clean the back rooms and the toilets instead. My dad was also strict about us being close as a family and instilling strong values. We had dinner together every night; those traditions make you who you are later in life.\n\nThe klan (from left) Kris, Khlo\u00e9, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Caitlyn, Kim's daughter North and Kylie in 2016\n\nI was 19 when my father died [of oesophageal cancer, aged 59]. It was very stressful, everyone was figuring out their grief and we were lost. I think I was in denial. A lot of my hair fell out - I think it was because I internalised my emotions. It was hard not to have him there. I was really angry. It helped when I started talking about it, but it took me three years just to understand and accept it.\n\nWe didn't get one dollar when he died. We got no inheritance, not his home or his cars or anything. I was working for him at the time and his company got taken away so I didn't have a job, and it was a lot to process at one time. I don't think people realise that none of us had trust funds. I got evicted from my apartment because I couldn't pay my rent, so I moved in with Kourtney and we started Dash [a chain of boutiques] together. Financially, that was a good learning experience for a 19-year-old - to know that when you're getting a pay cheque, you can't just spend it all!\n\nMy sisters bossed me around when I was younger. I was the only employee in our store for three years, so when they got asked to go somewhere cool, I was the one stuck behind. When we were younger we were jealous of one another, but not in a malicious way.\n\nThere is no rivalry between us now. We all have our own identities. Kendall and I were exercising this morning, and I asked, 'When was the last time you worked out?' And she said, 'A few weeks ago.' And I'm, like, 'Ugh, it's not fair!' because she is a supermodel with a perfect body! But [the banter] is playful and we come from a place of two heads are better than one, and three are better than two. Why would I not want to share my success with my family?\n\nMy mum was 22 when she married my dad, who was 12 years older than her. She didn't have to work and she was with us all the time, but she learned so much from my dad. When she divorced him and married Bruce [now Caitlyn] Jenner, she revitalised Bruce's career. My mum is so confident and powerful.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 with (from left) Kourtney, Kris and Rob in 2012\n\nWe're successful as a family because my mother has always believed in us. She would sit in meetings in front of the highest executives and say, 'My children can do X, Y and Z.' People ask, 'Is it hard having your mother as a manager?' And I say, 'Of course it is.' We are constantly together and sometimes it's difficult to differentiate a business deal from a family thing. But no other manager would believe in us like our mother does.\n\nMy boyfriend is very protective of me. Feeling loved and validated and secure is a huge thing. Tristan is protective of my entire family, which is beautiful. And I love that everything we do is as a union. When he speaks, it's 'us' and 'we,' and that's important because it shows that you're sharing life. The best thing is that we're able to communicate about anything, and I think a lot of relationships don't flourish because people are afraid to voice their opinion, not wanting to rock the boat.\n\nI love to cook, and Tristan loves everything I make. But I don't think men realise how long things take. I make dishes from scratch, and he'll be, like, 'Can you make me an apple pie?' I say, 'Do you know how long it takes?' He loves Cinnabons [cinnamon rolls], so I learned how to make them by watching a YouTube video. I ended up teaching my mum to make them, too.\n\nIt's good to find someone who has the same belief system and morals as you because it makes things easy. Tristan and I are both Christians; we go to church, we pray, we're vocal about God and spirituality. A lot of my girlfriends get pregnant without talking about things such as religion with their significant others and then find they have different belief systems to them.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 now has 68.5 million Instagram followers and her own TV show Revenge Body\n\nI definitely want a family, but I don't feel any pressure. Tristan is a great dad [he has an eight-month-old son with his previous partner] and he definitely wants more children, but we both feel that it will happen when the time is right. We're still in a new relationship and I love us having time together. Once you have kids you can't get back your non-kid years. My sisters and I bother my mum all the time, so I know it's not, like, 'When they're 18, you don't worry about them again.' You worry about your children for the rest of your life. The concern I have is raising little human beings in a world that's filled with such hate and terror. That seems very scary.\n\nI'm in the best relationship I've ever been in and it doesn't take a ring for me to feel that way. I believe in marriage and I want to be married again one day but I don't have a time frame. Why do people think that marriage equates to happiness? There are a lot of people in unhealthy marriages.\n\nMy house is the fun house for my nieces and nephews. We do arts and crafts and bake a lot. We like to play outside and in the pool, just being goofy. I have water balloons and we have water fights. I'm like a big kid myself. At night when I babysit them we have dance parties. I love to give their mums the evening off.\n\nThe worst thing that happened to us in the past year was Kim's robbery [in a gunpoint hold-up at her private hotel in Paris last October, Kim was robbed of jewellery]. But I'm also grateful that she wasn't physically hurt. I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and it was almost like God's way of saying, 'We need to teach you guys to be more aware of security' and also, 'This can all be gone in an instant so always tell one another you love them - no matter what.' The robbery was a huge wake-up call for our entire family. I really hate it when people say, 'Oh, it was Kim's fault. She was too flashy.' I could show you hundreds of people on Instagram who show off wads of cash and diamonds.\n\nThe best thing that has happened this year was meeting my niece Dream, my brother Rob's baby [with Blac Chyna]. She looks exactly like him. I melt when I see him with her because he's a phenomenal father, just like my dad was.\n\nI think the show has kept our family close. When people get older, most go their separate ways, they're busy with their own families. I see my family almost every day. Will I be sad when the show ends? Yes, because it will be the end of an era - not because I won't be on TV. I have so many other businesses that I would love to indulge in that I don't have enough time for now. But it will be bittersweet. I'm beyond grateful for everything the show has given me, but mostly for the bond with my family.\n\nI have a fascination with the Kennedy family. I'm intrigued by their dynamic and their unity. Even after John F Kennedy was assassinated, I love how Jackie was still so connected to her in-laws. What I respect is their love and loyalty to one another - it's something I relate to. It reminds me of the bond we have in our family. Also, they received a lot of unfair media reports, but they have always held their heads high.\n\nWhen you have money, it's easy to buy things for people, but that doesn't mean you're there for them. I've helped people pay off their mortgages, paid for their children's schools, their medical bills... But as corny as it sounds, the nicest thing you can give is your time, like being with friends who are going through divorce, listening to them. I've sat in hospital rooms with people for endless hours. I believe the kindest thing I can give is my empathy and my love.\n\nI wouldn't change my family for anything. People might look at us and be, like, 'Oh God. There are so many of them and there's always drama!' But there's drama within any family. I know people who only have one brother and they don't talk to each other. I'm so blessed. I talk to my brothers and sisters every single day. We are family by blood, but we're friends by choice. It's not a requirement. My family is the best.\n\nGood American Sweats will be available worldwide from Thursday from goodamerican.com\n\nIT'S ALL IN THE JEANS\n\nKhlo\u00e9 with Good American co-founder Emma Grede\n\nBy Good American co-founder Emma Grede\n\nKhlo\u00e9 is really involved with everything: from design to fabric colours. She is a proper business partner; she and I speak absolutely every day. She is super hands-on and a normal girl.\n\nOur jeans are made for a proper woman's body - for hips and a bottom. We use premium fabric, which has great recovery, so you don't have to wash the jeans every time you wear them. Khlo\u00e9 and I spend months wear-testing everything. Bella Hadid said they were her favourite jeans ever!\n\nOur bestseller is the Good Waist style, which are really high-waisted skinny jeans in a basic blue. It's a flattering cut because most people have decent ankles, but I'm praying that proper flares come back in - a real 70s revival. I love them, but I'll have a problem getting Khlo\u00e9 to try them; she wouldn't be seen dead in flares!\n\nGood Sweats are different [to most casual wear] because they are sexy. You don't look like you just put on a potato sack!\n\nI'm proud of Good American because of our inclusive sizing and super-diversity. On our website you'll see a beautiful classic blonde bombshell model as well as somebody a little bit more boyish, because women are not cookie-cutter shapes - we're all different. We're all about fully embracing that.\n\nEmma has worked with leading designers including Vivienne Westwood and Zac Posen and specialised in celebrity fashion partnerships, brokering deals such as Natalie Portman's collaboration with Dior.", "timeCrawl": "23:20:00", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8853813", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "id": 180, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "id": 244, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "id": 289, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "id": 594, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "id": 1032, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

She does not know why he has not asked her to marry him already and is just starting to become very frustrated because she wants a family and kids stat!\"\n\n\"She wants her ring and she is just so bothered that he has not even gotten one yet,\" continues the webloid's supposed snitch, who adds, \"Khloe wants nothing more than to start a family and have a bunch of kids with Tristan. She sees both of her sisters with all these kids and it just makes her sad that she is the odd one out.\"\n\nNotably, though, this article is headlined, \"Khloe Kardashian Threatens Tristan Thompson With Marriage Ultimatum,\" but there's nothing said in the story about an actual threat. What did Kardashian say? How did Thompson respond? Is there a deadline? Will they breakup if he doesn't propose soon? RadarOnline made this allegation about a \"marriage ultimatum,\" but apparently has nothing to back it up aside from claiming Kardashian is tired of waiting.\n\nWhat's more is that this tale is inconsistent with the site's past \"reporting.\" In March, for instance, the outlet speculated Kardashian and Thompson had eloped. Then in May, as if it never wrote that prior story, the publication claimed the reality star was in the midst of planning a big wedding. Yet, based on this new story, marriage may not even be in the cards, and nothing is said about wedding plans.\n\nSo, what's actually going on? Well, for starters, Gossip Cop is told that the blog once again doesn't know what it's talking about. This is, after all, the same webloid that said Kardashian was ready to adopt Rob's daughter Dream a few months ago. And last year, RadarOnline falsely claimed Kardashian was still hooking up with Lamar Odom, and then one day later wrongly alleged she wanted to start dating women.\n\nWe're reminded that the site likes to manufacture stories about the star and her famous family because they typically get clicks.

We hope to break down barriers.\n\n\"Just because you're bigger or curvier, it doesn't mean you don't want to be stylish.\"\n\nShe has proved the best model for her products and featured in both their jeans campaigns as well as showing off its summer bodysuit line when she gave a teasing glimpse of bare skin in an off-the shoulder lacy number.\n\nEarlier this year, Khloe - who is loved up with new man Tristan Thompson - shared a lengthy and inspirational message with her fans on Instagram, revealing her shock at how her life has changed since embracing fitness.\n\nKhloe wrote: \"If you were to ask me five years ago if I ever saw myself being completely in love with fitness and health.

Saint actually weighs more than North, if that is believable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kim and her husband Kanye West - who also have four-year-old daughter North together - are set to welcome another child via surrogacy and it has been revealed the couple decided to have another child because she \"missed having a baby in the family\".\n\nA source said recently: \"After having Saint, Kim was told she couldn't carry another baby - that it would be too dangerous - and she was okay with that. She was content with two. But even after having Saint and knowing everything, Kanye was already talking about having more kids. He would want a family of five or six if it was up to him.\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\n\"Kim was never going to let herself get pregnant again. But she thinks her kids have grown up too fast and misses having a baby in the family. Things have been good for the past few months, and she started agreeing with him [about having another child].\"\n\nAnd it is no surprise that the pair decided to have more kids as it was previously revealed Kanye is \"crazy\" about his children.\n\nAn insider shared: \"He loves being a part of the [Kardashian] family and to involve them in the upbringing of his kids. People forget that he has a big family ... so family has always been crucial. And he wants his kids to have that. He's crazy about his kids. They keep him grounded.\"\n\nKylie Jenner doesn't want birthday gifts\n\nKylie Jenner doesn't want any gifts and would rather have a \"nice card\" for her birthday.\n\nThe 'Life of Kylie' star turns 20 on Thursday but insists she doesn't \"really like\" people buying her gifts because it's rare there's anything she actually needs as she usually buys things for herself.\n\nAsked what she wants for her birthday, she said: \"A jewellery holder. I needed a new something to carry my jewellery in. That's literally something random. That's the only thing I can think of.\n\n\"Other than that I really don't want anything. I don't care.\n\n\"I'm doing special charity things on my birthday and I like sentimental things, because the materialistic things, if I want something, I'll usually get it myself. I don't really like when people buy things for me.\n\n\"Like I would love just a nice card. A handwritten card.\"\n\nThis year, Kylie - who is dating Travis Scott - is planning a much quieter birthday celebration than usual.\n\nShe told E! News: \"Usually I go on a trip every year and I like to do something special and big. This year I'm just feeling family vibes.\n\n\"I just want to be around my family and my friends and just do something cute.\"\n\nAnd though Kylie's best friend, Jordyn Woods, 19, is keen to plan something special for her pal, she admitted it isn't easy to organise anything for because the Lip Kit guru always wants to be involved.\n\nJordyn said: \"She's not difficult to shop for, but she's definitely difficult to do anything for because she likes to be so hands on in a situation so she just asks a lot of questions. I'm like, 'Just chill! Just relax!' You know?\"\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna almost finalised custody agreement\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are close to finalising their custody agreement over their nine-month-old daughter Dream.\n\nThe pair have been at loggerheads since the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star uploaded a series of explicit photos of the 29-year-old model online and accused her of cheating on him, but it seems they're keen to keep an amicable relationship when it comes to nine-month-old Dream as they've almost agreed on a custody arrangement.\n\nAccording to TMZ, neither Rob nor Chyna are seeking child support at the moment, but it's believed all that may change when the 30-year-old sock designer finds out that his former flame is raking in more cash than him.\n\nRob - who was once a recluse - reportedly makes little on his own outside of his family's E! reality TV show, whereas Chyna is making huge wads of cash from club appearances and hosting gigs.\n\nMeanwhile, although everything looks rosy in the eyes of the law, Rob is reportedly struggling to come to terms with his split and has been comfort eating to cope with how bitter things have gone between them.\n\nA source said recently: \"He's the biggest he's ever been. He's well over 300lbs now - we don't know as the scales don't go up past that - and he's a heart attack waiting to happen.\n\n\"He's been comfort eating big time. His fridge has become his best friend.\"\n\nRob - who was diagnosed with diabetes in 2015 after he piled on the pounds - has reportedly been binge-eating on fast food and candy and gulping down cans of soda.\n\nThe insider added: \"He's got major anger and addiction issues, brought on by a chronic lack of self-esteem over his looks and his position in the family. He's lost the will to live and if it wasn't for his little girl he'd probably not have made it.\"\n\nRob previously credited Chyna as his \"motivation\" for losing weight after they started dating last year.\n\nPosting a picture of them on Instagram previously, he wrote: \"Looking from where I started 298lbs to my current weight now 248.4lbs. I'm focused and determined to reach my goal weight 200-205lbs .... Happy I found my motivation.\"\n\nHe also claimed his then-partner had helped him beat diabetes with her loving home cooking.\n\nSpeaking after being hospitalised with the condition, he said: \"It was a big-time scare. I had found out I had type two diabetes six months before but I stopped taking my insulin. I didn't enjoy the routine. So I ended up nonstop throwing up, and I couldn't even swallow because my mouth was dry. I felt like I was going to die. When I got out of the hospital, I knew I needed to make changes. Chyna and I had a really big talk and she told me that by having her cook for me, my diabetes would be gone. And it is.\"\n\nKim Kardashian West asks for Instagram suggestions\n\nReality TV beauty Kim Kardashian West has asked her followers to suggest ways to improve her Instagram account.\n\nThe 36-year-old beauty is among the most-followed celebrities on the photo-sharing website, but has bemoaned her page's lack of consistency and has pleaded with her fans for suggestions.\n\nKim wrote on the site: \"I need more consistency on my insta feed. Should I go back to all one filter? Please help. I really need to step my insta page up (sic)\"\n\nThe reality TV star has as many as 102.1 million followers on Instagram, in addition to 54.5 million followers on Twitter.\n\nKim typically keeps her fans entertained with eye-catching snaps and behind-the-scenes insights into her life - but she recently admitted it is difficult to post worthwhile content.\n\nSpeaking about her Instagram-related stresses, she explained: \"It's such a struggle. It really is.\n\n\"If people think you just post and it's so easy, it's not. I like my Instagram to look a certain way. There's so much pressure to post, too. If I go to Japan and I just want to have a media-free vacation, and have a great birthday trip. It's the upkeep.\"\n\nKim recalled one specific incident during a vacation with her husband, rap star Kanye West, that really caused her some stress.\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nKim, who has daughter North, four, and 19-month-old son Saint with her husband, shared: \"Kanye and I woke up at 3am and we couldn't get back to sleep and I said let's go into, in this town in Tokyo where there are all these bright lights, let's go take all these pictures and we'll post them on social media and it will look so cool.\n\n\"We tried to do it, and it was such a mess, and he just was not the best photographer. I was like, 'You ruined what my social media was going to look like.' So we scrapped that shoot, but we got the good experience.\"\n\nKhloe Kardashian went on 'blind date' with Tristan Thompson\n\nKhloe Kardashian has revealed she and Tristan Thompson first met on a blind date and things went so well that they met up again.\n\nThe 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star has been romancing the NBA star for just under a year and, although people began speculating that they were dating just weeks after they met, the brunette beauty has only just revealed to her famous family how the pair actually got together.\n\nIn a short promotional video of the upcoming 10th anniversary special of their E! reality TV show, the 33-year-old reality TV babe told the series' creator Ryan Seacrest during a sit-down interview that she and 26-year-old sportsman were set up and didn't know they were meeting one another.\n\nThe revelation came as a huge surprise to Khloe's sister Kim Kardashian West - who is married to rapper Kanye West - and she demanded to know who set the pair up on their blind date.\n\nA shocked Kim said in the clip: \"Really, who set you up?\"\n\nKhloe has made no secret of the fact she wants to take things slowly but it seems their relationship is going from strength-to-strength as they're reportedly keen to buy a second house together.\n\nA source said recently: \"They live at Khloe's Calabasas house right now.\n\n\"He thinks the drive from Calabasas to Los Angeles is too far every day. When they go out in Los Angeles, they want a second house that's closer.\"\n\nAn estate agent told an online publication that the couple reportedly looked at several properties at the beginning of last month, but are yet to put an offer in on any of them.\n\nThe loved-up pair will hit their one-year milestone in August and Khloe is \"just the happiest\".\n\nAnd it looks like wedding bells could be on the horizon as the sportsman is keen to tie the knot with his girlfriend but he's adamant he won't be part of the \"Kardashian circus\" - but that sits well with Khlo\u00e9 as she is reluctant to make the mistakes she made during her first marriage to Lamar Odom.\n\nA source said previously: \"He is willing to ride this Kardashian wave if Khloe promises to give him some distance from the TV show and her mum and sisters.\n\n\"Khloe told him she's learned her lessons from her disastrous marriage to Lamar, as well as seeing the negative effect on Kim's marriage - and on her mum.\"", "timeCrawl": "06:52:00", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8553565", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "id": 174, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "id": 180, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "id": 231, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "id": 541, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "id": 557, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Endocrine_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Endocrine Disorders", "id": 928, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare", "id": 1012, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I believe in marriage and I want to be married again one day but I don't have a time frame.\n\n''Why do people think that marriage equates to happiness? There are a lot of people in unhealthy marriages.''\n\nThe 33-year-old beauty ''definitely'' wants to have children one day and thinks Tristan - who has eight-month-old son Prince with former girlfriend Jordan Craig - is a ''great dad'', but right now she wants to focus on having quality time with the 26-year-old basketball player.\n\nShe told You magazine: ''I definitely want a family, but I don't feel any pressure.\n\n''Tristan is a great dad and he definitely wants more children, but we both feel that it will happen when the time is right. We're still in a new relationship and I love us having time together.

The concern I have is raising little human beings in a world that's filled with such hate and terror. That seems very scary.''\n\nKhloe believes the Christian faith she shares with Tristan has kept their relationship strong and will serve them well in the future.\n\nShe said: ''It's good to find someone who has the same belief system and morals as you because it makes things easy.\n\n''Tristan and I are both Christians; we go to church, we pray, we're vocal about God and spirituality.\n\n''A lot of my girlfriends get pregnant without talking about things such as religion with their significant others and then find they have different belief systems to them.''\n\nAnd Khloe is thankful Tristan is so ''protective'' of her and makes her feel incredibly secure.\n\nShe said: ''My boyfriend is very protective of me. Feeling loved and validated and secure is a huge thing. Tristan is protective of my entire family, which is beautiful.\n\n''And I love that everything we do is as a union. When he speaks, it's 'us' and 'we,' and that's important because it shows that you're sharing life.\n\n''The best thing is that we're able to communicate about anything, and I think a lot of relationships don't flourish because people are afraid to voice their opinion, not wanting to rock the boat.''", "timeCrawl": "08:23:00", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8889804", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "id": 69, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "id": 121, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "id": 193, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "id": 544, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "id": 594, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "id": 1631, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Kim flaunted her curves in a floor-length sparkly purple gown, while Kendall and Khlo\u00e9 both sported variations on the classic LBD.\n\nThe lipstick maven, who bid adieu to 19 earlier that day with a sizzling nude bikini shoot, took to Instagram after the festivities to commemorate her new decade with a photo of herself shot against a mural decorated with a scattering of butterflies. \"20,\" she simply captioned the artistic shot.\n\nRELATED: Kylie Jenner Looks Like a Mermaid in This Pre-Birthday Bikini Shoot\n\nThis milestone birthday is officially one for the books!", "timeCrawl": "11:10:00", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8598840", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Sculpture", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Sculpture", "id": 160, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "id": 231, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "id": 362, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Baked_Goods", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Baked Goods", "id": 628, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Swimwear", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Swimwear", "id": 756, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking_and_Confections", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking and Confections", "id": 1003, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "id": 1177, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Don't start with the whole black going back bullsh*t, but what is it?\"\n\nUm? Khloe was visibly taken aback, as Pauly pressed the issue, saying that almost everyone in the family is dating or married to a black person. \"A lot of guys want to have sex with you and they're like, 'F**k, I'm not black. I can't hook up with her.'\" Gross!

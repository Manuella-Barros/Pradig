Though Sunak apologized for not attending Thursday\u2019s final commemoration on Omaha Beach in Normandy, his critics said the decision showed disrespect to the veterans and diminished the U.K.\u2019s international standing. Other world leaders including President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy were all present. Keir Starmer, the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, remained to the end and said it was up to Sunak \u201cto answer for his choice\u201d to skip the D-Day event. With opinion polls giving Labour a commanding lead ahead of the election on July 4, Sunak\u2019s gaffe has raised concerns that the Conservatives\u2019 support may come under further pressure over coming days. Campaign gaffes are regular features of British elections. Some have more impact than others. Here are a few that have lit up campaigns in recent decades: PHOTOS: Rishi Sunak's D-Day departure is just the latest in a long line of gaffes in UK election campaigns Following a difficult few years in government that saw oil prices quadruple following the Yom Kippur war between Israel and Arab nations and the miners\u2019 strike causing widespread economic pain, then Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath called a general election a year earlier than necessary for February 1974. On explaining his decision to hold the election in the midst of a winter when power was being rationed, Heath said that he sought a mandate from the British people to rein in the power of trade unions. His question to the public was \u201cWho governs Britain?\u201d Ultimately, the British people decided it wasn\u2019t Heath, and Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson returned as prime minister. Following the Falklands War in 1982 in which British forces sailed thousands of miles to the South Atlantic to expel invading Argentine troops, Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was riding high and was widely expected to win the general election she called for June 1983. Her victory in the election became more or less assured after Labour, which had been riven with divisions over the previous few years, published an election manifesto that one moderate member of the party described as \u201c the longest suicide note in history.\u201d The manifesto advocated an array of radical left-wing policies to be funded by higher taxes. It also called for unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from what was then the European Economic Community - a policy that the Conservatives would embrace decades later. Thatcher won a landslide and remained in power until 1990 when she was ousted by lawmakers in her own party. After 1983\u2019s big defeat, the Labour Party sought, under the leadership of Neil Kinnock, to move back to the center ground, where historically elections are won. By the time the election was called for April 1992 by John Major, who replaced Thatcher, Labour was contending again. With a week or so to go before the elections, opinion polls were moving in favor of Labour, if not quite winning then becoming the biggest party. A rally was held in Sheffield, a city in the north of England, and optimism was high. It was unlike anything seen before in the U.K. - more like an event seen in U.S. presidential elections. Kinnock was clearly caught up with the buoyant mood and started shouting a phrase that sounded like \u201cWe\u2019re all right!\u201d or \u201cWell all right\u201d several times. Whatever he actually said, his perceived overconfidence was widely perceived to be one of the reasons why Labour fell way short and the Conservatives won a fourth straight election. With hindsight, this was one of the most boring postwar elections, with Tony Blair\u2019s Labour Party widely expected to be re-elected by a big margin, akin to the one it achieved four years earlier. The election took place a month later than Blair had planned in June 2001 as a result of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Nothing else surprising happened, until Blair\u2019s deputy John Prescott punched a man with a mullet hairdo after he had thrown an egg at him on the campaign trail. The incident threatened to derail Labour\u2019s campaign, but Blair managed to defuse its impact at the following morning\u2019s press conference. \u201cJohn is John,\u201d he said, to widespread laughter among the journalists present. Blair\u2019s successor Gordon Brown didn\u2019t have his predecessor\u2019s natural communications skills and that was particularly evident in the election campaign of 2010. Brown\u2019s ratings - and Labour\u2019s - had collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis and the party, in power since 1997, faced losing to the Conservatives. With barely a week to go to the May election, 65-year-old Gillian Duffy quizzed Brown while he was canvassing over the state of the economy and the party\u2019s immigration policies. Following her interrogation and still wired up to Sky News when he got into his car, Brown told his advisers that the meeting was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that she was \u201cjust a bigoted woman.\u201d The gaffe dominated the rest of the campaign and there was no way back for Labour, though the Conservatives failed to win an outright majority and David Cameron had to enter into a coalition arrangement with the smaller Liberal Democrats. Theresa May, who succeeded Cameron after he resigned following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in a referendum in June 2016, sought to capitalize on the Conservative Party\u2019s big opinion poll lead and called an early general election for June 2017. Her hope was that a big majority would help her face down critics - both within her ranks and the opposition - in the upcoming Brexit discussions with the EU. However, her proposal to change the way retirees pay for long-term care was criticized across the political spectrum and was quickly dubbed the \u201cdementia tax.\u201d May was forced to make an embarrassing partial reversal. Rather than increase the modest majority that Cameron had secured in the 2015 general election, she lost it. Her premiership never recovered and she was replaced by Boris Johnson two years later.", "summary": "The decision by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to leave D-Day commemorations in northern France early has caused a political storm that threatens to derail his Conservative Party's general election campaign.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/8/rishi-sunaks-d-day-departure-is-just-l-writethru-1/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/08/Britain_Election_Campaign_Gaffes__59004.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:53:58", "author": "Pan Pylas", "authors": ["Pan Pylas"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.157}

(7News) -- Controlled explosives will be used in the next phase of the removal of the Francis Scott Key Bridge from the Patapsco River.\n\n\"The Key Bridge Response Unified Command is scheduled to use precision cuts made with small charges to remove a large section of the Francis Scott Key Bridge wreckage from on top of the M/V DALI,\" the press release stated.\n\nOfficials said the time and date of the cuts will depend on several environmental and operational factors.\n\n\"The small charges, a standard controlled demolition tool, will split the large section of truss at specific locations to create multiple, smaller sections, which allows salvors to use cranes and barges already on scene to remove these sections of the bridge and ultimately remove the M/V DALI from the channel,\" officials said.\n\n7News spoke to an urban waterway expert who said the goal is to have pieces of the bridge thrust away from the Dali, but there are risks involved.\n\n\"Anytime you're doing this, you're going to have pieces of the bridge falling, and you just want to make sure they don't fall in a way that could actually damage the ship and make the job even harder, right? \"Or God forbid knock containers into the water that contain substances,\" said Gary Belan, the Senior Director of Clean Water Policy at American Rivers. \"My understanding of the way that the containers on the ship are situated is the ones that contain toxic substances are farther back away from where the bridge is. So at this point, I'm optimistic that they should be able to do this without further harm to the river, but again watching and waiting. It's all in terms of how it happens.\"\n\nMORE |Potential environmental impacts from Baltimore bridge collapse concern advocacy groups\n\nBelan added that \"controlled explosives\" can sound quite intense, but it's not as it may seem.\n\n\"Sometimes people think they're going to see a big flash or something like that. That's not the case in this,\" Belan said. \"They might see smoke, and they'll hear the boom, but they put the explosives in the bridge metal itself and then wrap it. So, if all goes right, you'll just see puffs of smoke and then you'll see pieces of the bridge kind of break apart. So I just don't want people thinking they're going to see giant explosions.\"\n\nAll of this will happen while the 21-member crew is still aboard.\n\n7News spoke to Andrew Middleton, director of the Apostleship of the Sea, a ministry of the Catholic Diocese that meets and helps crews from all over the world when they arrive at the Port of Baltimore.\n\nMiddleton met the crew six weeks ago before the collapse, and he visited them out on the water last week.\n\nMORE | Catholic sea ministry says ship crew was in good spirits before Baltimore bridge collapse\n\n\"You know, it's kind of what we always do. Just normally, we don't take a small boat out to go. We pull a van up alongside the ship and walk up the gangway,\" Middleton said.\n\nHe said he spent about three hours with members of the crew.\n\n\"All seem to be in good spirits and well taken care of,\" Middleton said. \"I think at this point it's just kind of the unknown of when will they be able to be freed and refloated? I think those are the things more than anything they're worried about right now... It's just kind of the unknown of being stuck in that one position for so long.\"\n\nThere's no timeline yet for when these cuts will begin.\n\n\"Hearing protection is not required outside of the 2,000-yard noise radius.

Specialists are cutting precise holes in the bridge's girders and packing them with explosive charges, then wrapping the charges with a mat material. When all is ready and the button is pushed, the truss will be cut into a dozen pieces and will collapse into the water, falling safely away from the ship.\n\nWhen the Dali hit and collapsed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in late March, the bridge's truss, deck and part of a support column came down on the ship's bow - pinning it to the muddy bottom of the channel. Almost all of this debris has been painstakingly cleared away, except for the largest section of the truss, which the team has labeled \"section four.\" An animation released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Baltimore branch shows how the explosive charges will cut up this final section, without risking salvage personnel or lifting equipment during the removal.\n\nThe unified command has previously hinted at a simultaneous cutting method that would free up section four, but only recently confirmed that the team would use explosive charges. The process will be dramatic, but it will not be a Hollywood-grade fireball, the USACE said. The detonations will sound more like a string of fireworks, and there will be no vast bursts of flame. The crew is expected to stay safely aboard the ship throughout the process, a Coast Guard spokesman told local media earlier this week.\n\nWhile waiting for the refloat operation to be finished, the Captain of the Port for Maryland has reopened the \"limited access channel\" next to Dali for commercially essential shipping. The waterway reopened Wednesday at 1900 and will remain open until 0600 on Friday. This time, the allowable draft has been increased to 45 feet from the previous restriction of 35 feet. This is nearly back to the normal depth of the federal channel, 50 feet - though the waterway is still much narrower because of the need to navigate around Dali and the truss section. A two-tug escort is required for all traffic.

The span immediately collapsed into the Patapsco River.\n\nSix construction workers who had been repairing potholes on the bridge were killed.\n\n\"The safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\" according to a Unified Command statement. \"This is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces, which will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\"\n\nThe release did not say when the controlled explosions would take place. The removal of the bridge debris will allow the Dali which, with its crew, has been trapped in the river for more than six weeks, to return to port.\n\nBut The Baltimore Sun has obtained an email that indicates the ship is expected to be moored at the Seagirt Terminal \"on or about May 14.\"\n\nSent to attorneys of \"claimants\" against the shipping company and manager, the email says they will be allowed to come onto the vessel for inspections they requested -- but only after the National Transportation Safety Board, which plans to be aboard on Tuesday and Wednesday, disembarks.\n\nThe email says claimants will be permitted aboard the ship starting May 20. It asks the claimants to limit the number of those boarding to experts and attorneys and to specify the area of the ship they want to inspect and the amount of time they need.\n\n\"We will have to stagger attendances to accommodate the various claimants,\" the email said.\n\n\"In addition, salvage work at the bow of the vessel may restrict access to the bow,\" according to the email from William \"Bill\" R. Bennett III, who represents Grace Ocean Private Ltd., the owner of the Dali, and Synergy Marine Pte Ltd., its management company.\n\nThe NTSB, along with the FBI and other agencies, is investigating the collapse of the bridge.

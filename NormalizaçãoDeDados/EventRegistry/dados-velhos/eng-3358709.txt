Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters, culminating on Saturday with a man ramming a car through the counterprotesters. Authorities said the attack killed one woman and injured 19 other people.

Bossert also praised Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer and Virginia Gov. Terry McAullife for taking actions in anticipation of the violence and said what happened Saturday \"was an unacceptable, planned demonstration of violence.\"\n\nPressed again on the President's position towards the white supremacists, Bossert offered a condemnation of hate groups.\n\n\"I condemn white supremacists and racists and white Nazi groups and all the other groups that espouse this kind of hatred,\" Bossert said.", "time": "15:48:00"}

homeland security adviser, said the administration condemns the white supremacists and racists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.\n\nBut, Bossert also offered some defense for his boss against allegations that the president's reaction on Saturday was notable because it didn't condemn white supremacists by name, or didn't call the violence acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe marches became violent as counter-protesters showed up, and eventually turned deadly when a man drove a car into a crowd, an action police are describing as deliberate. One woman was killed, and more than a dozen others were injured.\n\n\"I, for one, was with the president yesterday and proud of the fact that he stood up and calmly looked into the camera and condemned this violence and bigotry in all its forms. This racial intolerance and racial bigotry cannot be condoned,\" Bossert told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nTapper pressed Bossert by reading a posting from a white supremacist website that praised the president for not singling out those groups, and by ignoring a question asking if he condemned neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"So, Jake, what you need to focus on is the rest of his statement,\" Bossert began.\n\n\"The president didn't just call for human beings to respect one another which is his pragmatist core, fundamental, bare minimum. But he called for, ideally, Americans to love one another, for all of God's children to love one another. That is a fundamental assault on the very nature of the hatred that we're seeing here. And I guess you're going to continue to press on the words he didn't say.\"\n\nStill, Tapper pressed again, noting much of the criticism on the words the president didn't say were coming from Republicans like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Sen. Cory Garnder of Colorado.\n\n\"This is unacceptable. This violence cannot stand,\" Bossert said. \"He made that clear yesterday.

Lee.\n\nThey clashed with counterprotesters, culminating on Saturday with a man ramming a car through the counterprotesters. Authorities said the attack killed one woman and injured 19 other people. Two Virginia state patrol troopers later died in a helicopter crash while assisting in the city's response to the protests.\n\nTrump gave a statement condemning Saturday's violence from \"many sides\" and faced bipartisan criticism for failing to name and condemn white supremacy.\n\nBossert said Trump's statement was aimed at calming the situation in Charlottesville and emphasized that people should focus on the portion of the President's statement calling for unity and denouncing bigotry.\n\nBossert added that both he and Trump wanted the attacker to face \"swift justice\" and noted the Department of Justice was pursuing a civil rights investigation.\n\n\"This individual should face swift justice,\" Bossert said. \"The President of the United States shares that view. I know he does.\"\n\nAnd, like Trump, he pointed to both sides for the chaos that unfolded.\n\n\"These groups showed up spewing hate,\" Bossert said. \"These groups showed up looking for violence.\"\n\nAsked what groups he was referring to, Bossert replied, \"I refer to the groups that clashed yesterday.\"\n\nHe denied, however, assigning blame to different groups, saying the blame was squarely on the driver of the vehicle that crashed into the counterprotesters. Bossert also praised Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer and Virginia Gov. Terry McAullife for taking actions in anticipation of the violence and said what happened Saturday \"was an unacceptable, planned demonstration of violence.\"\n\nPressed again on the President's position towards the white supremacists, Bossert offered a condemnation of hate groups.\n\n\"I condemn white supremacists and racists and white Nazi groups and all the other groups that espouse this kind of hatred,\" Bossert said.", "time": "15:47:00"}

This racial intolerance and racial bigotry cannot be condoned.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike are slamming Trump, however, for his comments condemning racism and bigotry on \"many sides\" following the violent confrontations and after a man rammed counterprotesters with his car.\n\nBossert, though, on Sunday defended Trump, saying his comments were appropriate as the protests \"turned into an unacceptable level of violence at all levels.\"\n\n\"This wasn't just some fighting,\" said Bossert. \"This turned into an unacceptable degree of violence and ended in the most tragic way possible. We have two police officers dead...we have a young woman that passed away and others critically injured.\"\n\nBut, he insisted, the incidents are not about Trump, but about \"a degree of violence and of hatred that cannot be tolerated in this country.\"\n\nTapper, though, pointed out that Trump's words have been praised by white supremacists and neo-nazis, including on a neo-nazi website that proclaimed \"Trump comments were good. He said he loves us all. Also refused to answer a question about white nationalists supporting him. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.\"\n\nBossart said such words of the \"ignorant\" mean little to him and should have less weight with Tapper and the media, but they don't.\n\nTrump, continued Bossert, believes Americans should have an open debate on racism and violence in the United States.\n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" he said. \"This violence cannot stand. He made that clear yesterday.\"\n\nBossert said he does believe there were good people in Charlottesville to protest the removal or maintenance of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, but they showed up to find violent groups from both sides, \"dressed in riot gear and prepared for violence.\"\n\nHe also rejected Tapper's argument that the counterprotesters did not kill anyone.\n\n\"I don't for one moment and I won't allow you for one second to put me in a position of being an apologist for someone who is now a charged murderer,\" said Bossert. \"This individual should face swift justice. The president of the United States shares that view. I know he does.\"\n\nTapper, though, told Bossert he \"decried both sides,\" which Bossert denied.\n\n\"What I would decry is the individual that committed murder yesterday,\" he said. \"What I would not do, though, is quibble with this notion that any of this is acceptable. These groups showed up spewing hate.

Security Adviser Tom Bossert on Sunday because President Donald Trump had refused to specifically condemn a so-called Alt-Right rally with self-styled Nazis after an alleged white supremacist with the group appeared to run over a group of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring 19.\n\nBy Sunday, reports said that at least three people had died in what many officials are describing as a domestic terrorist incident.\n\nDuring a short conversation with reporters on Saturday, Trump blamed the violence \"on many sides, on many sides.\" The president, however, did not call out the white nationalists directly.\n\nTapper pointed out that Trump \"didn't go far enough\" in his condemnation of the rally.\n\n\"He believes that all Americans should have a conversation and an open debate on this matter,\" Bossert opined. \"This violence cannot stand. He made that clear yesterday.\"\n\nAccording to Bossert, not everyone who participated in the white supremacist rally is a racist.\n\n\"I'm sure there were good people,\" he insisted, \"that had various opinions on the maintenance or the removal of the statue. But what they found when they showed up were groups showed up from both sides looking for trouble, dressed in riot gear, prepared for violence.\"\n\n\"How many people did the counter-protesters kill yesterday, Mr. Bossert?\" Tapper quipped.\n\nWithout answering the question, Bossert observed that \"one death is too many.\"\n\n\"The victim was a counter-protester!\" Tapper interrupted.\n\n\"Hold on, Jake!\" Bossert exclaimed. \"I don't for one moment and I won't allow you for one second to put me in a position of being an apologist for somebody who is now a charged murderer.\"\n\n\"You just decried both sides,\" Tapper said, raising his voice. \"Here we have a situation, Mr. Bossert, where neo-nazis, the Klan, Alt-Right and others went to Charlottesville, Virginia chanting antisemitic, anti-African-American and other racist slogans, provoking the people of Charlottesville, Virginia, making them feel intimidated. Yes, violence did break out. But one person was killed by one of these Alt-Right-Klan-Nazi protesters.\"\n\n\"And you just decried both sides!\" the CNN host added. \"This is the issue.\"\n\n\"No I didn't,\" Bossert remarked incorrectly. \"You're making this issue a little bit distorted.\"", "time": "15:47:00"}

CNN\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper grilled a top White House adviser over President Donald Trump's refusal to explicitly condemn white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and members of the alt-right who converged Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday.\n\nIn a statement after the deadly rally, the president responded to the violence that erupted in Virginia as a group of white supremacists clashed with counter-protesters, decrying the \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\"\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert dismissed criticism that the president refused to adequately condemn white supremacists.\n\nBossert praised the president's statement, saying that Trump appropriately called-out an event that \"turned into an unacceptable level of violence at all levels.\"\n\n\"This isn't about President Trump -- this is about a level of violence and hatred that could not be tolerated in this country,\" Bossert said. \"I was with the president yesterday, and I'm proud of the fact that he stood up and calmly looked into the camera and condemned this violence and bigotry in all its forms. This racial intolerance and racial bigotry cannot be condoned.\"\n\nTapper then read Bossert a quote from a white nationalist website that said Trump's statement was \"really, really good\" for calling out violence \"on many sides.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bossert, that's a neo-Nazi website celebrating how equivocal and vague the president of the United States was,\" Tapper said. \"Are you at least willing to concede that the president was not clear enough in condemning white supremacy?\"\n\n\"The words of the ignorant bear little with me and should bear less with you in the media,\" Bossert replied, saying the president \"didn't dignify the names of these groups of people, but rather addressed the fundamental issue.\"\n\nBossert repeatedly attempted to blame Tapper and the media for scrutinizing Trump's refusal to explicitly condemn white supremacy, saying \"what you say and do think does pervade what you say on air and the things you cover.\"\n\n\"Jake, what you need to focus on is the rest of his statement,\" he added. \"I guess you're going to continue to press on the words he didn't say, but I'd like you to focus on the statement that he did say.\"\n\nThe two continue to spar for several minutes, as Tapper pointed out that Trump officials like adviser Sebastian Gorka have said that white supremacists are not \"the problem,\" and that many Republican officials criticized Trump for not taking a strong enough stance against white supremacists.\n\n\"When you just condemn groups, as opposed to specifically white supremacists, Nazis, Klan members -- it creates this vagueness,\" Tapper said. \"And you, on this show today, have said that you condemn groups, and condemn actions and condemn bigotry. But I haven't heard you say 'I condemn white supremacists, I condemn nazis, I condemn the alt-right.' And I think a lot of people are upset, a lot of Republican officials, that they didn't hear that from President Trump. But I don't want to belabor the point.\"\n\n\"I think you've belabored it so let me say I condemn white supremacists, and nazis, and groups that favor this type of exclusion,\" Bossert said. \"I can't be clearer.\"\n\nDespite his unequivocal language on a variety of issues, Trump has repeatedly bungled attempts to condemn white supremacy.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, the then-Republican candidate for months ignored opportunities during interviews to distance hiimself from former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke, who praised Trump.\n\n\"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,\" Trump said in an interview on CNN. \"Did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists.\"", "time": "15:14:00"}

Sunday that President Donald Trump had emboldened organized racists who caused the racially charged violence in his city over the weekend.\n\n\"Look at the campaign he ran,\" Signer said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nSigner called on everyone to join together to recognize and combat racism, adding that the effort should include Trump.\n\nWhite supremacist demonstrators clashed with counterprotesters in the Virginia city on Saturday, with the violence culminating with a man ramming a car through a group of counterprotesters. Authorities said the attack injured 19 and killed one.\n\nIn a statement responding to the deadly attack, Trump blamed \"many sides.\"\n\nSigner accused Trump of running a campaign that attracted racist groups and said he had personally opted not to push back forcefully against them.\n\n\"Look at the intentional courting both, on the one hand, of all these white supremacists, white nationalist groups like that, anti-Semitic groups,\" Signer said. \"And then look on the other hand, the repeated failure to step up, condemn, denounce, silence, you know, put to bed all those different efforts.\"\n\nHowever, Signer said the country would move ahead, and the problems went beyond what he saw in Trump.\n\n\"To be honest, this is not about Donald Trump,\" Signer said, adding that the violence from white supremacists demonstrated that the country's core democratic principles were eroding, but people had an opportunity to change for the better.\n\n\"People will react to the darkness with a whole lot more light,\" he said.\n\nSigner called the racist demonstrators, marching with tiki torches in hand, a \"visible display of intimidation\" and said he expected an aggressive case to be made against the man behind the deadly attack.\n\n\"I hope that if the facts are there, that we vigorously prosecute this as a case of domestic terrorism,\" Signer said. \"This cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nOn the same program, White House Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert defended Trump's remarks, saying the President's statement did not equivocate the white supremacists with the counterprotesters.\n\nBossert blamed \"both sides\" for Saturday's violence, while also saying the White House was \"absolutely\" against white supremacists.\n\n\"I'm sure there were good people in the groups that had various opinions on the removal or maintenance of the statue,\" Bossert said. \"But what they found when they showed up were groups from outside that showed up on both sides, looking for trouble, dressed in riot gear, prepared for violence.\"\n\nBossert added that both he and Trump wanted the attacker to face \"swift justice\" and noted the Department of Justice was pursuing a civil rights investigation.\n\n\"This individual should face swift justice,\" Bossert said. \"The President of the United States shares that view. I know he does.\"\n\n\"These groups showed up spewing hate,\" he said. \"These groups showed up looking for violence.\"\n\nAsked what groups he was referring to, Bossert replied, \"I refer to the groups that clashed yesterday.\"\n\nPressed again on the President's position towards the white supremacists, Bossert offered a condemnation of hate groups.\n\n\"I condemn white supremacists and racists and white Nazi groups and all the other groups that espouse this kind of hatred,\" he said.", "time": "16:22:00"}

from his team, according to the official to whom the statement was attributed, and Thomas P. Bossert, the White House homeland security adviser, was in Bedminster monitoring the situation.\n\nMr. Bossert, in an interview Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" dismissed any suggestion that the president had failed to adequately condemn white supremacists.\n\nMr. Bossert praised the statement the president made on Saturday -- which denounced the \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" -- saying that Mr. Trump had appropriately criticized an event that \"turned into an unacceptable level of violence at all levels.\"\n\n\"This isn't about President Trump -- this is about a level of violence and hatred that could not be tolerated in this country,\" Mr. Bossert told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"I was with the president yesterday, and I'm proud of the fact that he stood up and calmly looked into the camera and condemned this violence and bigotry in all its forms. This racial intolerance and racial bigotry cannot be condoned.\"\n\nMr. Tapper responded by citing a white nationalist website that described Mr. Trump's remarks as \"really, really good.\" He then asked Mr. Bossert: \"Are you at least willing to concede that the president was not clear enough in condemning white supremacy?\"\n\nMr. Bossert replied that Mr. Trump \"didn't dignify the names of these groups of people, but rather addressed the fundamental issue.\"\n\nMr. Trump consulted a broad range of advisers before speaking on Saturday, most of whom told him to sharply criticize the white nationalist protesters. The president listened attentively, according to a person familiar with the discussions, but repeatedly steered the conversation back to the breakdown of \"law and order,\" and the responsibility of local officials to stem the violence.\n\nTwo Virginia state troopers who were involved in the response to the violence died when their helicopter crashed in a wooded area near the campus on Saturday.\n\nAs the gravity of the events on Saturday became clearer, the pressure on Mr. Trump to make a stronger statement came from his innermost circle of advisers and family.\n\n\"With the moral authority of the presidency, you have to call that stuff out,\" Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of Mr. Trump's who served briefly as White House communications director last month, told George Stephanopoulos of ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\n\n\"I wouldn't have recommended that statement,\" added Mr. Scaramucci, whose abbreviated tenure was characterized by a pledge to let Mr. Trump express himself without interference from staff members. \"I think he would have needed to have been much harsher.\"\n\nMr. Scaramucci, a New York hedge fund executive, blamed the influence of Mr. Trump's embattled chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who ran Breitbart News, a website that attracted a substantial following among white nationalists.\n\nMr. Scaramucci said there was a \"sort of Bannon-bart influence\" that \"is a snag on the president.\"\n\nStill, the tone and tenor of the president's comments on Saturday -- noticeably less fiery than what he has had to say on Twitter and in public settings about the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell -- reflected Mr. Trump's own thinking.\n\nAnd the episode again proved the limitations of Mr. Trump's family, which was once expected to exert a moderating influence on his presidency.\n\nIvanka Trump, a senior adviser to her father, used Twitter early Sunday to denounce the violence in Charlottesville, becoming the highest-ranking administration official to condemn the protesters on the record.\n\n\"There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis,\" she wrote Sunday.", "time": "17:28:00"}

On Saturday, Donald Trump blamed \"violence on many sides\" for the weekend of chaos.\n\nBossert echoed Trump. \"I'm sure there were good people in the groups that had various opinions on the removal or maintenance of the statue,\" Bossert told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"But what they found when they showed up were groups from outside that showed up on both sides, looking for trouble, dressed in riot gear, prepared for violence.\"\n\nSetting aside this attempt to draw equivalency -- yes, there were counter-protesters who engaged in violence, but none of them killed anyone, and they weren't there to defend the notion that one race is superior to another -- it's worth focusing on Bossert's suggestion that there were \"good people\" who came to Charlottesville to protest the removal of a Confederate memorial.\n\nThe weekend of violence began after white nationalist groups convened a rally in Charlottesville to protest the city's decision to remove a statute of Robert E. Lee. Lee, a slaveowner, led a treasonous army against his own nation in order to defend the proposition that one human can own another human.\n\nHe was also known as a particularly cruel slaveowner. Lee's slaves viewed him as \"the worst man I ever see\" because of his practice of breaking up slave families and hiring different family members off to different plantations.\n\nThe initial wave of protesters defending Lee's statute surrounded a small group of counter-protests on Friday night while holding torches and chanting \"you will not replace us\" and \"white lives matter.\" Some of them threw their torches at the counter-protesters.\n\nAnd, again, they came to Charlottesville to defend the image of a notorious white supremacist who is famous largely for his central role in the greatest act of treason in American history.\n\nNow, in fairness, Bossert is hardly the first person to paint Confederate sympathizers with the brush of normalcy. The urge to reconcile the two warring sides of the nation began almost immediately after the Civil War ended, with African American rights often sacrificed on the altar of such a reconciliation.\n\nBut he should know enough about history to understand what, exactly, the pro-Confederate protesters were there to defend.", "timeCrawl": "18:01:00", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950254", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "id": 121, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "id": 232, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "id": 705, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 14, "totalResults": 14}}}

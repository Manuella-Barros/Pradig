{"id": 225023882, "title": "Mobile deal offering 40GB of data for just \u00a33 is five times cheaper than Sky - here's how to get it", "text": "Upgrading your device can be a costly affair, but finding the right data plan at an affordable price is another challenge altogether. The latest offer from online retailer Mobiles.co.uk might be a worthy solution for techies. The online retailer, who scours mobile sites for the best deal, has highlighted an incredibly cheap deal from iD Mobile offering 40GB of data for \u00a33 a month. A fraction of the price compared to competitors like Sky Mobile, which charges \u00a320 a month for a slightly bigger 50GB package or \u00a312 a month for a much smaller 10GB of monthly data. The total cost of the \u00a33 deal over the two-year contract comes to \u00a372, but a rival 50GB would set shoppers back a huge \u00a3480 across its contract. While we regularly check out deals from EE, O2, and Sky, this one from lesser-known network iD Mobile has certainly caught our attention.

The plan also includes unlimited UK minutes and texts. To get the offer, head to Mobiles.co.uk and select the top iD Mobile plan. Here, you must follow a few steps to secure the deal, customers will pay the standard \u00a37 a month price, but there's a simple way to save a full \u00a396, reports the Mirror. This saving brings the price down to the cheaper \u00a33 a month rate. Once you've secured your new SIM, be sure to visit its online cashback claim on months 7, 12, 16, 20, and 24. After submitting your claim, you'll receive \u00a319.20 each time, totalling \u00a396. This reduces the usual \u00a3168 total price to just \u00a372 for the two-year contract. You can find the deal here as well as all the details about claiming the cashback. Not only does this offer a more affordable way for shoppers to upgrade their SIM in light of increasing UK prices, it also includes a generous amount of inclusive roaming data (subject to fair use). You can also shop other SIM-only deals at EE, O2, and Sky all of which have different perks like EU roaming, double-data offers, and TV freebies like a Disney+ subscription.", "summary": "The new deal is a fraction of the price compared to competitors like Sky Mobile, which charges \u00a320 a month for a slightly bigger 50GB package or \u00a312 a month for a much smaller 10GB of monthly data", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/mobile-deal-offering-40gb-data-29257006", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29257004.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_iphone-14-hacks.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:09:08", "author": "Harriet Morphy-Morris,Rachel Sloper", "authors": ["Harriet Morphy-Morris", "Rachel Sloper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.181}

It\u2019s been widely reported that he would face the winner of what turned out to be an entertaining welterweight clash before the year is out \u2013 and with Crocker being the victor, it\u2019s believed Matchroom and Conlan Boxing will now move to make one of the most eagerly anticipated all-Irish clashes in recent times for Belfast in November. However, Donovan has another idea and suggested it to the Matchroom CEO last night. Post the show the Limerick southpaw approached Hearn and asked him to promote him versus Crocker in Limerick. In footage sent to Irish-boxing.com, Donovan can be seen telling Hearn he wants the fight to be in Limerick or even Dublin. \u201cYou promised me a fight in Limerick City. Let\u2019s make me and Crocker in Limerick City. Put it in Limerick City the fight will sell out.\u201d Donovan is open to New York and Dublin as venues for what is becoming a bigger fight by the day, but isn\u2019t keen on Belfast. It seems the Andy Lee-trained \u2018Real Deal\u2019 doesn\u2019t want to do it on a Conlan Boxing card. \u201cThem Conlan\u2019s will rob me,\u201d he continues, \u201cWe agreed to Limerick City,\u201d he continued before telling the Matchroom boss he\u2019d beat both Walker and Crocker if paired with either. Hearn was obviously caught unawares but handled the ambush well and went to a go-to \u2018we\u2019ll have to check the numbers\u2019 response.", "summary": "<p>Paddy Donovan ambushed Eddie Hearn with a Lewis Crocker Limerick request last night. &#8216;The Real Deal&#8217; was a guest of</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.irish-boxing.com/paddy-donovan-surprises-eddie-hearn-with-lewis-crocker-limerick-request/\">Paddy Donovan surprises Eddie Hearn with Lewis Crocker Limerick Request</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.irish-boxing.com\">Irish Boxing</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.irish-boxing.com/paddy-donovan-surprises-eddie-hearn-with-lewis-crocker-limerick-request/", "image": "https://www.irish-boxing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-23-Jun-2024-02-41-AM-9547.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:47:20", "author": "Irishboxing", "authors": ["Irishboxing"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.066}

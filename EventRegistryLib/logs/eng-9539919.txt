will also give wildland firefighters the same cancer, heart and post-traumatic stress coverage as municipal firefighters and create a new high school apprenticeship pathway to graduation that the government is hoping will help meet demand for skilled trades.\n\nProvincial officials said the legalisation will also do away with sick note requirements for short absences in an effort to decrease the workload of family doctors.\n\nMcCleave-Kennedy added that the province and the ministry should focus more efforts on health and safety training.", "source": {"uri": "northernontario.ctvnews.ca",

And what we're seeing here is the baseline that you have to get back to someone to let them know.\"\n\nAnd, he added, \"there are many more who do more than that, who really tailor a personalized response.\"\n\nPiccini said the new measures build on the province's four previous \"Working for Workers\" bills, which have mandated more transparency in ads by requiring that salary ranges be included, and also making Ontario the first province to do away with Canadian work experience as a job requirement.\n\nLast December, the Star's Kevin Jiang wrote about job-seekers applying to so-called \"ghost jobs\" -- positions advertised by companies that had no immediate plans to hire, or that had already set the job aside for an internal hire. In some cases, companies had simply forgotten to remove online job postings.\n\nA survey of more than 1,000 American managers by Clarify Capital late last year found 43 per cent admitted to posting \"ghost jobs.\" While 37 per cent said they did it to keep a pool of candidates in case a job became vacant, others said it was to \"placate overworked employees.\"\n\nWhile regulations around the new legislation will set out specifics, the government plans to have a general intake line for applicants to report non-compliance. The Ministry of Labour will take a gentle approach at first, informing companies of their responsibilities, but will be able to follow up with penalties.\n\nThe legislation, which would change the Employment Standards Act, \"would make the hiring process fairer for jobseekers who are trying to get into the workforce ... Additionally, proposed changes would require larger employers to respond to job applicants whom they have interviewed once the position has been filled, which would make Ontario the first province in Canada to set this standard,\" the ministry said in a written statement.\n\nConsultations will be held on the changes, including the sizes of companies to be included, as well as possible penalties.\n\nPiccini said small businesses will be exempt from the new rules so as not to unfairly burden them.\n\n\"We're sending a strong message with legislation and then look forward to engaging in the consultation process,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristin_rushowy@thestar.com", "name": "Kristin Rushowy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Piccini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Piccini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Labour_(Ontario)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Labour (Ontario)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Piccini", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Piccini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-show_job", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "No-show job"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ottawa", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Ottawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/f2/df2c3e0b-49b8-5f84-a4ec-ba7d8e8c11ec/662fc08ec00c8.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539919", "eventUri": "eng-9539919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Simultaneously, it seeks to crack down on exploitative employers by raising the maximum fines for breaching the Employment Standards Act (ESA) to the highest in Canada.\n\n\"We know that the vast majority of employers across Ontario are doing right by their staff and customers and helping drive the economic prosperity of our province,\" said David Piccini, Minister of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development. \"But with today's announcement, we are sending a clear message to those bad actor employers out there that there are real consequences for bad behaviour. We are also supporting jobseekers by taking a balanced approach that gives them greater certainty in the hiring process without adding unnecessary or onerous requirements for employers.\"\n\nThe government is poised to introduce legislation that, if approved, will effectively double the maximum fine for individuals found guilty of violating the ESA, elevating it from $50,000 to $100,000, the highest fine across Canada. Moreover, there are plans to enact regulatory adjustments that would escalate penalties for repeat offenders who have breached the same ESA provision three or more times, lifting the fine from $1,000 to $5,000, one of the most substantial penalties in the nation. ESA infractions encompass various offenses such as failure to remunerate wages, discriminatory treatment of employees taking pregnancy or parental leave, and unequal pay based on gender for comparable work.\n\nIn addition, proposed amendments to the ESA would mandate larger employers to disclose the existence or absence of job vacancies in publicly advertised job listings. Furthermore, these proposed changes would oblige larger employers to provide feedback to job applicants who have been interviewed for publicly advertised positions, marking Ontario as the first province in Canada to establish this requirement. The government plans to engage in consultations regarding these proposed adjustments to ensure their implementation is conducted in a manner that minimizes bureaucratic hurdles for employers -- such as determining the scope of businesses affected by these measures and the most efficient method for responding to job seekers once positions are filled, potentially through automated processes -- while affording prospective employees the assurance they seek.\n\nThese modifications are part of a broader set of initiatives slated to be unveiled in the near future, which will expand upon the government's preceding Working for Workers acts. These efforts aim to safeguard workers, bolster their earnings, and facilitate the integration of newcomers in building Ontario. By prioritizing the welfare of workers, the government is forging a more promising future for all Ontarians, ensuring that the province remains an optimal environment for living, working, and raising families.\n\nQuick Facts:\n\nOntario has been progressively advancing a pioneering, pro-worker legislative agenda through the Working for Workers Acts of 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, with the goal of supporting, attracting, and safeguarding workers, enhancing economic competitiveness, and bolstering Ontario-based businesses.\n\nOntario stands out as the sole Canadian jurisdiction where penalties can be multiplied without limitation based on the number of employees affected by a violation, potentially resulting in substantial penalty increases depending on the scale of the violation.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Clarify Capital in October 2023, comprising 1,000 hiring managers, revealed that 50% of respondents acknowledged creating job openings to maintain a talent pool for future hiring needs, without immediate plans to fill positions.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Space Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Piccini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Piccini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Employment,_Workforce,_and_Labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Employment, Workforce, and Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Standards_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment Standards Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ontario", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ontario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remuneration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remuneration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Globe-General.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539919", "eventUri": "eng-9539919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

He was held in contempt of court and forced to spend the weekend in jail.\n\nCopeland, who is a convicted felon, reportedly gave police information about Young Thug and his associations to avoid going back to prison after he was caught with a gun while on parole.\n\nAfter Copeland returned to the stand on June 10 and began testifying, Steel confronted Judge Glanville about an ex parte meeting that was reportedly held that morning to convince Copeland to testify.\n\nThe judge became angry when Steel refused to tell him who informed the lawyer about the meeting and held Steel in contempt of court, stating that he would spend 20 days (10 weekends) in jail. However, the Supreme Court of Georgia granted Steel bond on Wednesday.\n\nA couple of days later, Steel confronted the judge again in court about how Copeland was being treated by the Fulton County DA's office, comparing it to \"communist Russia.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nThe trial, which began on Nov. 27, 2023, after the longest jury selection in history, has been plagued with arrests, charges, and various disruptions.\n\nA Fulton County grand jury indicted Young Thug in May 2022, and more charges were added in a subsequent indictment in August of that year. The second indictment accuses Young Thug and 27 other people of conspiring to violate Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO. The rapper is also accused of participation in criminal street gang activity, as well as drug and gun charges.\n\nProsecutors say Young Thug and two other people co-founded a violent criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they say is associated with the national Bloods gang. The indictment says Young Thug \"made YSL a well-known name by referring to it in his songs and on social media.\"\n\nIn addition to specific charges, the August indictment includes a wide-ranging list of 191 acts that prosecutors say were committed between 2013 and 2022 as part of the alleged conspiracy to further the gang's interests.\n\nIncluded in that list is an allegation that Young Thug threatened in July 2015 to shoot a security guard who was trying to get him to leave an Atlanta-area mall. The indictment also says Young Thug rented a silver Infiniti sedan that was used in the killing of a rival gang member. And, on numerous occasions, he and others are alleged to have possessed various illegal drugs that they intended to distribute.\n\nThe other defendants still facing trial include Marquavius Huey, Deamonte Kendrick (known as Yak Gotti), Quamarvious Nichols, Rodalius Ryan and Shannon Stillwell.\n\nThe other defendants who have already pleaded guilty to various charges prior to jury selection include Gunna, whose given name is Sergio Kitchens; Young Thug's older brother, Quantavious Grier (Unfoonk); Trontavious Stephens (Tick); and Antonio Sledge (Mounk Tounk).", "source": {"uri":

(Atlanta News First) - Everyone in the courtroom for rapper Young Thug's Atlanta criminal trial is now masked up as testimony resumed Monday.\n\nChief Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville said someone in the courtroom may have COVID.\n\nMonday was the first day following one of the most tumultuous weeks of the trial, a judicial proceeding that has already had more than its share of drama and conflict.\n\nOn June 13, and only hours after the Supreme Court of Georgia granted him bond, Young Thug attorney Brian Steel said his acclaimed musician client's trial is unfair; accused Fulton County Assistant Chief District Attorney Adriane Love of lying; and likened Glanville's courtroom of \"being like communist Russia.\"\n\nSteel accused prosecutors of coercing the testimony of YSL star witness Kenneth Copeland, who he said was being surrounded by law enforcement and district attorney officials.\n\nSteel is remaining free while his contempt of court charge is being appealed, and is being allowed to remain as counsel in the courtroom.\n\nSteel, along with Keith Adams, is one of two attorneys representing the global superstar rapper in what is becoming Georgia's longest -- and unquestionably highest-profile -- trial in history.\n\nThe trial's latest round of upheaval actually began when Copeland -- aka Woody -- was jailed for refusing to testify. Copeland is widely believed to have informed police of crimes allegedly committed by Young Thug and alleged YSL criminal gang.\n\nCopeland then changed his tune, and agreed to testify. Then Glanville ordered Steel to be held in the Fulton County Jail for no more than 20 days, consisting of every weekend for the next 10 weekends.\n\nSteel was taken into custody when he refused to answer repeated requests from Glanville on how he heard about a conversation during a meeting that involved prosecutors, the judge and a key witness.\n\nCopeland eventually returned to the stand and identified himself in old pictures with defendant Shannon Stillwell. Prosecutors then began questioning his relationship with Young Thug, and Deamonte Kendrick, also known as Yak Gotti.\n\nIn 2021, Copeland was arrested in Fulton County after a traffic stop uncovered a weapon on him. Copeland, already a convicted felon, could have been facing a 10-year jail sentence for having the weapon, but over the course of a three-hour interrogation, Copeland told detectives about several crimes that had happened and were about to occur.\n\nCopeland was sentenced to federal prison on Oct. 22, 2018, for being a felon in possession of a firearm after bringing an assault rifle into the Dunbar Recreational Center Gymnasium in Atlanta's Mechanicsville community.\n\nWilliams was arrested on May 9, 2022, along with 27 other suspected gang members in Buckhead as part of a 56-count indictment.\n\nThe trial's jury selection lasted longer than any other in Georgia history, and actual witness testimony itself will likely surpass state records. Both records were set by the Atlanta Public Schools teacher scandal and trial of 2014-15.\n\nThe trial - which has been repeatedly plagued by arrests, charges and disruptions - began on Nov. 27, 2023. Defense attorneys have repeatedly raised concerns that the trial could go on for years based on the number of witnesses the state plans to call up.\n\nProsecutors are attempting to show YSL, or Young Slime Life, is a criminal street gang responsible for numerous offenses. Defense attorneys say YSL is not a gang but simply the name of a record label, Young Stoner Life.\n\nYoung Thug himself is facing eight criminal counts under a federal law that was originally enacted to fight organized crime. Georgia is one of 33 states that has its own RICO law, but in the Peach State, the alleged criminal enterprises do not have to have existed as long as the federal law.\n\nWilliams is also charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute; possession of codeine with intent to distribute; possession of cocaine; possession of a firearm; and possession of a machine gun.\n\nAttorneys for Williams argue the artist is not the leader of an alleged gang like prosecutors claim.\n\nA total of 18 jurors have been selected, with six of them being alternates. Two jurors have already been excused; one had a medical emergency, and the other moved out of Fulton County.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The proceedings come after Young Thug's lawyer, Brian Steel, filed a motion to recuse Judge Ural Glanville from the trial on Monday.\n\nYou can watch the live stream in the YouTube player below.\n\nOn May 9, 2022, the hip-hop world was jolted with the news that rapper Young Thug -- a Grammy winner, trendsetter and Atlanta icon -- had been arrested.\n\nIt's been over two years now that the artist, whose legal name is Jeffery Williams, has remained behind bars. The central charge against him is that three letters with which his name has become synonymous because of his artistic success in launching the \"Young Stoner Life\" label, YSL, actually signalize a violent gang: Young Slime Life.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis named Williams, among other metro Atlanta rappers and those with ties to the alleged gang, to bring charges against a total of 28 people in a sweeping 88-page indictment. The case alleges that not only is Young Thug among the gang's members, but he is also its kingpin.\n\n\"He is the one they're all afraid of,\" a prosecutor said at a June 2022 hearing. \"He's the one that's King Slime.\"\n\nA long pretrial process passed to an even longer jury selection process, and across this time, the co-defendant list dwindled with plea deals and other circumstances, keeping some of the individuals charged from remaining on the case.\n\nThe trial finally began in earnest in November 2023, already considered the longest in Georgia's history.\n\nNow that it is in full swing, 11Alive is keeping track of key developments in the case and highlighting moments in the courtroom.

The indictment states that Young Thug \"made YSL a well-known name by referring to it in his songs and on social media.\"\n\nMost of those initially charged have already made deals with the state. Five defendants remain on trial along with Williams, including Shannon Stillwell, Deamonte Kendrick, Marquavius Huey, Quamarvious Nichols and Rodalius Ryan.\n\nCopeland allegedly agreed to provide information about Young Thug and others in an attempt to avoid returning to prison after being caught with a gun as a convicted felon. He began testifying for the prosecution last week after initially being held in contempt.\n\nHowever, he has been less than cooperative on the stand, often responding with \"I don't recall\" or \"I don't remember.\" He frequently asks the prosecutor, \"Whatchu mean?\" and exhibits behavior suggesting he is bored or annoyed to be there, often yawning and rolling his eyes.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Glanville has had to remind him several times to stand up when the jury enters or leaves the room. At one point, he was told to stop spinning in the witness chair. Additionally, he has complained of being lightheaded, hot, and thirsty while testifying.\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nWhen Copeland initially took the stand last week, the prosecutor asked him how old he is, to which he responded, \"I'm grown.\" He also declared on Tuesday that he no longer liked his attorney, saying, \"She fired. I don't want her.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Copeland started answering \"yes\" to every question. When asked if he was doing so to speed things up, he replied \"yes\" again. Later, he admitted that he wasn't being truthful during previous interviews with police and was trying to convince them of his innocence to avoid trouble.\n\nDay 93 (today) of the trial in Fulton County began with similar behavior from Copeland. When the court clerk reminded him to stand as the jury entered the room, he replied, \"I'm tired.\" After sitting down, he began yawning and then put his head on his hand. Shortly after, when the prosecutor asked if she could approach the bench, he replied, \"No.\"\n\nSimilar behavior continued as the prosecution began playing video of his past conversations with police officers. Copeland could be seen stretching and yawning repeatedly while in the witness chair.\n\nWATCH BELOW\n\nCourt broke early for lunch due to a problem with the air conditioning.

Like Trump, Young Thug is charged under Georgia's Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations [RICO] Act, which is designed to tackle organized crime. Fani Willis, the district attorney for Fulton County, which covers most of Atlanta, is prosecuting both cases. Newsweek sought email comment from Willis' office on Monday.\n\nAttorney David Lat wrote in his Original Jurisdiction legal blog on Sunday that the Young Thug trial offers valuable insights into how the Trump case would be prosecuted.\n\n\"Keep an eye on this case. It's a giant RICO trial of a famous defendant, being tried in Fulton County, Georgia, by District Attorney Fani Willis -- just like State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump.\n\n\"So when the Trump case starts moving forward again -- right now it's on hold by order of the Georgia Court of Appeals, which is hearing Trump's appeal of Judge Scott McAfee's order declining to disqualify Willis from the case -- the Young Thug case could offer us hints of what might lie ahead,\" Lat wrote.\n\nYoung Thug and 27 other people were indicted on charges of conspiring to violate Georgia's RICO Act for alleged membership of a street gang called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which also stands for the name of Young Thug's record label, Young Stoner Life.\n\nYoung Thug, real name Jeffery Lamar Williams, is also facing drug and gun indictments. Prosecutors say he frequently boasted about YSL in his rap songs, some of which have hundreds of millions of views on YouTube. Williams denies all charges against him and says in his defense that he is no gangster in real life and the lifestyle is simply adopted as part of his act to help sell a product.\n\nWillis also indicted Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and 17 others for alleged fraud in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. All of the accused pleaded not guilty, but at least four are now cooperating with authorities. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLat said that there will be one big difference between the Trump and Young Thug trials. \"I predict Judge Scott McAfee, who's overseeing the Trump case, will do a better job of running the trial than Judge Glanville is doing here,\" he wrote.\n\nNewsweek sought email comment from Glanville and from Donald Trump's attorney on Monday.\n\nLat said that the Young Thug trial has been moving extremely slowly, which may be a reflection of how the Trump trial will be conducted.\n\n\"Young Thug's trial began in January 2023 -- yes, 2023 -- and picking a jury took 10 months. Opening statements happened last November, and now, seven months later, the prosecution is maybe halfway through its witness list,\" he added.\n\n\"At 18 months, the trial is already the longest in Georgia state history -- and defense lawyers project it could go into 2025,\" Lat wrote.\n\nHe added that \"last week, the trial went off the rails -- or even more off the rails, if that's possible.\"\n\n\"On Monday, Judge Ural Glanville took the remarkable step of holding Young Thug's lead lawyer, Brian Steel, in contempt. I can't recall a high-profile case from the past 50 years where a defense lawyer was held in contempt -- and given a jail sentence -- in the middle of trial,\" he wrote.\n\nSteel was found in contempt for refusing to tell Glanville how he knew the details of a closed-door meeting Glanville had with prosecutors and Kenneth Copeland, the chief witness in the case.\n\nThe previous weekend, Copeland, aka Lil Woody, was jailed for contempt for refusing to testify in the case.\n\nHe agreed to testify after the meeting with Glanville but gave very disruptive evidence in which he said he didn't recall key events and repeatedly yawned and napped through his testimony.\n\nGeorgia attorney Ashleigh Merchant has been involved in both cases. She represents Trump's co-accused, Mike Roman, and she also intervened to represent Steel when he was found in contempt.\n\nSpeaking to Greta Van Susteren on the conservative news channel, Newsmax, on Sunday, Merchant said she rushed to court with about two dozen lawyers and paralegals to help Steel when he was found in contempt.\n\nShe added that, as president of the Georgia defense lawyers' association, she sent a \"strike force\" to help Steel, but only she was allowed into court.\n\nMerchant said this was \"insane\" as there were many empty seats in the public gallery where the other people with her could have been allowed to sit.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeal later agreed to stay Steel's jail time while it hears his appeal.\n\nOn the Trump trial, Merchant said that the case is also being considered by a higher court.\n\nShe said he had just heard that Willis' office had filed a motion urging the appeal court to return the case to trial and not hear Trump's arguments that she should be removed from the case.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com", "name": "Sean O'Driscoll",

The witness, Kenneth Copeland, had been sworn in for live testimony in front of the jury on Friday, June 7, but was taken into custody and spent the weekend in jail when Judge Glanville found him in contempt for refusing to answer questions after signing an immunity deal. The secret meeting on the morning of Monday, June 10, led into Copeland's return to the witness stand.\n\nIn their filing on Thursday, defense lawyers Douglas Weinstein, Jay Abt, and Katie Hingerty argue that \"troubling facts\" about the secret meeting \"implicate\" Judge Glanville in a joint effort to \"coerce Copeland to testify.\" They allege the judge and prosecutors engaged in an \"effort to join forces\" to get Copeland back on the witness stand under threat of returning to jail \"indefinitely.\"\n\n\"The only logical conclusion for the secret nature of the proceeding was to give Glanville in conjunction with the State the unfettered ability to harass and intimidate the sworn witness into testifying,\" the lawyers argue in the motion. They go on to say defense lawyers have a right to the full transcript of the meeting since Copeland may have said things that could be used to undermine his credibility on cross-examination.\n\nCopeland is a key witness in the case, because he had access to an Infiniti sedan that allegedly was rented by Young Thug and was later linked to the 2015 murder of Donovan \"Nut\" Thomas Jr. outside a barbershop in Atlanta. Yak Gotti, whose legal name is Deamonte Kendrick, is specifically charged with Thomas' murder alongside fellow defendant Shannon Stillwell. Young Thug, whose legal name is Jeffery Williams, was indicted on an overarching count of racketeering conspiracy, with Thomas' drive-by shooting death as an overt act carried out in furtherance of the alleged gang conspiracy.\n\nAccording to the petition filed Thursday, Kendrick's lawyers say they \"learned\" from an unidentified source that Judge Glanville informed Copeland during the secret meeting that he could keep Copeland incarcerated until all 27 remaining defendants charged under the indictment conclude trial -- not just the six defendants currently facing jurors in what's now the longest criminal trial in Georgia state history.\n\nThe defense lawyers further claim they believe Copeland said during the secret meeting that he would \"simply lie on the stand\" if forced to return and that he would testify he killed Thomas. The defense lawyers say such statements amount to important material they have a right to use as defense evidence. They go on to fault Judge Glanville for finding Williams' defense lawyer Brian Steel in contempt when he confronted the court about the secret meeting on June 10 and refused to divulge how he learned about it.\n\n\"It is apparent that Glanville has made every effort to keep the proceeding a secret and inaccessible to defense counsel - going so far as to hold Steel in criminal contempt for refusing to provide the name of our source,\" Weinstein and his co-counsel write.\n\nA spokesperson for the Fulton County Superior Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone sent Thursday. Prosecutors also did not respond to an email seeking comment on the emergency petition. Judge Glanville previously denied three separate recusal motions filed in his courtroom, including one from Kendrick's lawyers and one from Steel.\n\nWilliams, Kendrick, and four others deny the charges against them and are expected to be on trial through the end of the year. Prosecutors already have called more than 70 witnesses in the frequently delayed proceeding, but that's still not half of the names on their list. Steel previously called the case against his client \"unconscionable and unconstitutional.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The judge's decision to hold a private meeting with Willis' office, a state witness, and the witness' counsel -- as well as his response to the revelation of that meeting -- has prompted defense attorneys in the case to seek Glanville's recusal from the YSL trial.\n\nIn a scathing motion filed Monday, attorney Brian Steel, who is representing Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug in the case, claimed Glanville had \"become a member of the prosecution team\" when he held a meeting that allowed Willis' team \"to induce a material witness to testify.\"\n\n\"The motion is a hatchet, not a scalpel,\" former federal prosecutor and elected state attorney Michael McAuliffe told Newsweek. \"It accuses the judge of essentially acting in league with the prosecutors and being biased against the defense.\"\n\nMcAuliffe said what was \"extraordinary\" about the motion was its \"tone,\" which didn't \"event try to cloak the accusations in any manner of respectful advocacy as to the judge's conduct.\" He said the \"nakedly aggressive approach\" signals that the defense doesn't think there's anything to lose in challenging Glanville.\n\n\"It also means the strategy is to inject as much controversy, maybe even chaos, into very lengthy proceedings with the likely goal of forcing a mistrial,\" McAuliffe said.\n\nThe sweeping RICO indictment against Young Thug and 27 other defendants has posed challenges for prosecutors. Even though only six of the defendants are standing trial, the proceedings have been ongoing for nearly seven months and are expected to continue well into 2025.\n\n\"This case was always going to be a beast to try,\" Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University, told Newsweek. \"It's legally complex. There's many defendants. There's more lawyers than defendants. But once the focus became about personalities and not the allegations and the evidence, all those preexisting challenges were exacerbated.\"\n\nWhile much of the motion focused on Glanville, it also offered a stark warning for Willis. On Monday, Steel argued that his client had been deprived of his constitutional right to \"ethical prosecutors,\" saying that the district attorney's office has \"abandoned and violated\" their duties and that it was \"teaming up\" with the judge to \"gain an unlawful advantage\" over the defense. He also accused the prosecutors of engaging in witness intimidation and coercion during the meeting in Glanville's chambers.\n\n\"The Brian Steel contempt circus was a bigger embarrassment for the judge than the DA's Office, but there is still plenty for Willis' office to be concerned about,\" former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek.\n\nKreis agreed that while the motion was more of a reflection of Glanville's judgment than of Willis' office, \"it would've been wiser for prosecutors to not have sought an ex parte meeting at all.\"\n\nPointing out the other controversies that have clouded the YSL trial, Rahmani said, \"There is the perception that Fulton County is out of control.\"\n\nAside from the private meeting and the judge's decision to sentence Steel behind bars for not exposing his sources, the trial has also made headlines because one of the defendants was stabbed in jail, a witness revealed that an investigator from Willis' office asked her out on a date during the investigation and drugs were distributed in the middle of the courtroom.\n\n\"Even people who haven't been following the trial closely saw Judge Granville blow up on Steel for no good reason on social media,\" Rahmani said. \"Of course, everyone had already heard of Willis hiring her boyfriend, Nathan Wade, as special counsel in the Trump case and the ensuing side show that resulted in his disqualification.\"\n\n\"Willis has botched both cases because of these self-inflicted mistakes and charging and trying too many co-defendants at once,\" he continued. \"Those decisions have ground both proceedings to a halt.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d'etre behind Biden's decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington's decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump's opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening U.S. asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he unveiled a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could pave the way for a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and that are due to sunset at the end of 2025. That package permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and it roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax hikes that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- even though doing so would likely require congressional approval.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d'etre behind Biden's decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington's decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump's opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening U.S. asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he unveiled a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could pave the way for a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and that are due to sunset at the end of 2025. That package permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and it roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax hikes that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- even though doing so would likely require congressional approval.", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nABORTION\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nCLIMATE/ENERGY\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nDEMOCRACY/RULE OF LAW\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d'etre behind Biden's decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington's decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump's opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening U.S. asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nISRAEL/GAZA\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he unveiled a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could pave the way for a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nLGBTQ+ ISSUES\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nNATO/UKRAINE\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nTARIFFS/TRADE\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nTAXES\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and that are due to sunset at the end of 2025. That package permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and it roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax hikes that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- even though doing so would likely require congressional approval.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump's opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening U.S. asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nISRAEL/GAZA\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he proposed a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could lead to a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nLGBTQ+ ISSUES\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nNATO/UKRAINE\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nTARIFFS/TRADE\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nTAXES\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law and are set to expire at the end of 2025. That package cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Those elements will remain until and unless a new law changes them, but many other tax cuts in Trump's package will lapse without further action by Congress. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax increases that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- though doing so would probably require congressional approval.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nABORTION\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nCLIMATE/ENERGY\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nDEMOCRACY/RULE OF LAW\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d'etre behind Biden's decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington's decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children.

And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nISRAEL/GAZA\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he unveiled a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could pave the way for a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nLGBTQ+ ISSUES\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nNATO/UKRAINE\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nTARIFFS/TRADE\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nTAXES\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and that are due to sunset at the end of 2025. That package permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and it roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax hikes that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- even though doing so would likely require congressional approval.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jill_colvin@aol.com", "name": "Jill Colvin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "calvin_woodward@aol.com", "name": "Calvin Woodward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@aol.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nAbortion\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nClimate/energy\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the US will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the US to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and showerheads.\n\nDemocracy/Rule of law\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d'etre behind Biden's decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington's decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the January 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether US democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the January 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nFederal government\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nImmigration\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the US without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump's opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening US asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the US.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in US history -- an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the US whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nIsrael/Gaza\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on October 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he proposed a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could lead to a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nLGBTQ+ issues\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nNATO/Ukraine\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued US assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with US aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nTariffs/trade\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield US producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25 percent from 7.5 percent. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of US Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10 percent or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the US. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning US infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nTaxes\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent and the corporate minimum tax to 21 percent as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21 percent and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15 percent for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25 percent of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 Covid-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law and are set to expire at the end of 2025. That package cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Those elements will remain until and unless a new law changes them, but many other tax cuts in Trump's package will lapse without further action by Congress. Trump says he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further -- to as low as 15 percent -- and repeal any tax increases that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income -- though doing so would probably require congressional approval.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices - if the winner gets his way - are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn\u00b4t work out for either of them - Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks with reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Monday, July 15, 2024. as he heads to Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here\u00b4s where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he\u00b4s declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group\u00b4s size this decade. Despite all this, it\u00b4s unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden\u00b4s goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it\u00b4s his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He\u00b4d increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration\u00b4s aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn\u00b4t be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d\u00b4etre behind Biden\u00b4s decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington\u00b4s decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year\u00b4s presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump\u00b4s denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America - lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything\u00b4s honest, I\u00b4ll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it\u00b4s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He\u00b4d then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He\u00b4s pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump\u00b4s opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening U.S. asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history - an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He\u00b4d bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he\u00b4d revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He\u00b4d also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He\u00b4d seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden\u00b4s foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he unveiled a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could pave the way for a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel\u00b4s efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he\u00b4s also been critical of some of Israel\u00b4s tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women\u00b4s rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women\u00b4s sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won\u00b4t get federal money. He\u00b4d take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia\u00b4s invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don\u00b4t hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies - in a continued appeal to working-class voters - have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan\u00b4s Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and that are due to sunset at the end of 2025. That package permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and it roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax hikes that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- even though doing so would likely require congressional approval.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump attends the first day of the Republican National Convention, Monday, July 15, 2024, in Milwaukee.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe recent assassination attempt against Trump left both he and Biden urging national unity in a rare moment of overlap from both sides. But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nABORTION\n\nBIDEN: The president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nCLIMATE/ENERGY\n\nBIDEN: In a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nTRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\n\nDEMOCRACY/RULE OF LAW\n\nBIDEN: Protecting democracy has been the raison d'etre behind Biden's decision to run for reelection. In a symbolic nod to the Revolutionary War, Biden delivered his first campaign speech of 2024 near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he spoke of George Washington's decision to step down as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won. During the Jan. 5 speech, Biden said this year's presidential contest is \"all about\" whether U.S. democracy will survive and he regularly condemns Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 general election. Biden has called the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol a \"day that we nearly lost America -- lost it all.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president, who famously refused to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, has not committed to accepting the results this time. \"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" Trump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" He has said he will pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI \"from the ground up,\" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nBIDEN: The Biden administration is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.\n\nTRUMP: The former president vows an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for stymying his first term agenda: \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\" He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He'd then move to fire \"rogue bureaucrats,\" including those who \"weaponized our justice system,\" and the \"warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.\" He's pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nBIDEN: The president continues to advocate for the comprehensive immigration bill he introduced on his first day in office, which would grant an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children. That legislation went nowhere in Congress. This year, facing large numbers of people crossing the border illegally, the president backed a Senate compromise that included tougher asylum standards and billions more in federal dollars to hire more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. That deal collapsed on Capitol Hill due to Trump's opposition. Biden instead issued two major executive actions on the border in recent months, one tightening U.S. asylum restrictions and the other offering potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could include detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new \"ideological screening\" for immigrants to bar \"dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.\" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor \"jihadist sympathies.\" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.\n\nISRAEL/GAZA\n\nBIDEN: The war in Gaza, more than other national security considerations, has defined Biden's foreign policy this year, with significant political implications. He has offered full-throated support for Israel since Hamas militants launched a surprise deadly assault on Oct. 7. But as the death toll in Gaza rose sharply, Biden faced massive backlash at home. In May he unveiled a three-phased hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden believes the deal could pave the way for a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war. He also calls for a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to \"destroy\" Hamas but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views.\n\nLGBTQ+ ISSUES\n\nBIDEN: The president and White House officials regularly denounce discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Shortly after he took office, Biden reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \"only two genders,\" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to \"defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.\" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the \"chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth\" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won't get federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who \"suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.\" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.\n\nNATO/UKRAINE\n\nBIDEN: The president has spent much of his time rebuilding alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden has pledged unceasing support to Kyiv and he made an unannounced visit there in February 2023 in a show of solidarity. His administration and Congress have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine. The latest tranche of aid totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance and is expected to last through this year. Continued U.S. assistance is critical, Biden says, because he argues that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to \"fundamentally reevaluate\" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent.\"\n\nTARIFFS/TRADE\n\nBIDEN: This is where Biden and his protectionist tendencies -- in a continued appeal to working-class voters -- have some similarities with Trump. Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. His administration in May said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, because it is \"vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"\n\nTRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs, proposing a levy of perhaps 10% or higher on nearly all imported foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation.\n\nTAXES\n\nBIDEN: The president has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of \"fundamental fairness\" that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Biden also wants to require billionaires to pay at least 25% of their income in taxes and to restore the child tax credit that was enacted under his 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired.\n\nTRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and that are due to sunset at the end of 2025. That package permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and it roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Trump has said he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further to 20% and that he would repeal any tax hikes that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income should he win a second term -- even though doing so would likely require congressional approval.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jill_colvin@thestar.com", "name": "Jill Colvin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@thestar.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But it's unclear how long that will last: Biden has largely built his reelection campaign around criticizing Trump as a menace to democracy and the nation's founding principles; the former president has long been a sharp Biden critic who relishes bombast and is known for holding political grudges.\n\nOn nearly every issue, the choices -- if the winner gets his way -- are sharply defined.\n\nThe onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or not. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go.\n\nAt no time in living memory have two presidents, current and former, competed for the office. Not since Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, both Republicans, in 1912, and that didn't work out for either of them -- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won that three-way race.\n\nMore than a century later, voters again get to judge two presidents on their records alongside their promises for the next four years. Here's where they stand on 10 of the top issues:\n\nThe president has called for Congress to send him legislation that would codify in federal law the right to an abortion, which stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. He has also criticized statewide bans on abortion in Republican states and says he will veto any potential nationwide ban should one come to his desk. In the absence of legislation, his administration has taken narrower actions, such as proposals that would protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.\n\nThe former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced in April that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he's declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.\n\nIn a second term, Biden could be expected to continue his focus on implementing the climate provisions of his Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. Biden is also enlisting more than 20,000 young people in a national \"Climate Corps,\" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Biden wants to triple the group's size this decade. Despite all this, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.\n\nHis mantra for one of his top policy priorities: \"DRILL, BABY, DRILL.\" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a \"hoax\" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

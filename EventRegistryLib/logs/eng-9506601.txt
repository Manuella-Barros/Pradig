Baltimore is expected to target players at offensive line, cornerback, running back and wide receiver, among other positions, but how those picks are spent -- and where they are ultimately made -- remains a mystery.\n\nBefore the first round starts Thursday, Baltimore Sun reporters Brian Wacker and Childs Walker and columnist Mike Preston answer questions about positions of need, potential trades, late-round targets and DeCosta's draft history.\n\nWacker: All options being equal, they should target the offensive line. It's their biggest need with three starting positions to fill and they have a chance to land a top prospect they can plug in for years to come. Washington's Troy Fautanu, who can play tackle or guard, would be ideal, but he's unlikely to be available by the time Baltimore picks at No. 30. The next best option is Oklahoma's Tyler Guyton. He has the size (6 feet 8, 322 pounds), length, footwork and tools to be a highly productive pass protector who Baltimore can start at right tackle this year before sliding him over to the left side whenever the Ravens move on from Ronnie Stanley. Guyton had just 14 career starts in college, but the tape and results speak for themselves with the Sooners star allowing just two sacks over three seasons, including two in which he allowed none.\n\nWalker: The Ravens won't lock in on one position, and that approach has led to a very good track record in the first round. That said, an offensive lineman makes a lot of sense given their need for multiple starters, their draft position and the depth of quality tackle prospects. Arizona's Jordan Morgan, a potential Day 1 starter at right tackle or guard, has become the player most linked to the Ravens in mock drafts, and it's hard to argue with his versatility. But they would be tempted by the greater upside of Georgia's Amarius Mims or Guyton if either tackle prospect slides to No. 30.\n\nPreston: It all depends on how the draft is going and whether there are runs on certain positions in the first round. The Ravens need offensive linemen, but the consensus is that this draft is filled with quality linemen, so there might not be a sense of urgency, at least in the first round.\n\nIf there is a receiver or edge rusher who the Ravens have rated highly and is available when they pick in the first round, they should go with their draft board because they can't go wrong with a top player at either position.\n\nIt's easier to make that decision when a team has a pick in the top four, but much harder near the tail end of the first round. With that said, I've always been an advocate of building strong interior lines on both sides of the ball.\n\nWacker: Picks, picks and more picks. That's the Ravens way and that should be the objective this year if their top player isn't on the board when they're on the clock, especially given the depth of the offensive line and wide receiver classes. They could slide out of the first round for a quarterback-needy team, acquire an extra pick and still get a starting-caliber cornerback, offensive lineman and wide receiver. It's not a deep draft, but there is value in the early-to-middle rounds.\n\nWalker: A trade up would be a major upset and a sign that some prospect the Ravens love is plummeting, whereas a trade down seems very much in play given that there will likely still be excellent offensive line prospects available around pick No. 40.\n\nThe Ravens never want to reach for a player when they can squeeze more total value out of a draft, and DeCosta has made it clear the next two years will present a major opportunity to rebuild the team's roster depth. That said, the Ravens have plenty of picks in a draft that's not deep overall. They need to come away with a starting offensive lineman, so if a candidate they fancy is sitting there at the end of the first round, they should not get too cute.\n\nPreston: If the Ravens are using this draft with the primary purpose of building the offensive line, then it might be in their best interest to trade down and acquire more picks, and certainly more talented offensive linemen. Passing on an offensive tackle such as Guyton in the first round, though, would be a tough decision.\n\nI don't see the Ravens trading up. The history of this organization has always been to acquire more picks, so I think they will either stay put or trade down.\n\nWacker: There will still be plenty of tantalizing wide receiver options in what is a deep class if the Ravens don't go that direction in the first round. Michigan's Roman Wilson is small (5-11, 185 pounds) but a dynamic, explosive and efficient slot weapon perfect for today's NFL. South Carolina's Xavier Legette is big (6-1, 221 pounds) with enough speed to be a deep threat and a good complement to the smaller Zay Flowers. Central Florida's Javon Baker, who reportedly had a predraft visit with the Ravens, is also on the bigger side (6-1, 202 pounds) with a wide catch radius and was one of the best in the country in yards per route run (5.07) last season. Another player to keep an eye on later in the draft will be Marshall running back Rasheen Ali, an instinctive runner with good burst who can also line up out wide.\n\nWalker: We've talked so much about offensive linemen, but this draft is also rich in wide receivers, and the Ravens need another one of those with Rashod Bateman potentially approaching the last year of his rookie deal. Legette is a big, fast (4.39 seconds in the 40-yard dash) outside target who would complement Flowers after developing for a year as the team's No. 3 or No. 4 option. He would also be an immediate candidate to help on special teams, either as a returner or in coverage, and we know how much the Ravens value that quality in rookies.\n\nPreston: Oregon cornerback Khyree Jackson, Georgia cornerback Kamari Lassiter or safeties Beau Brade of Maryland or Trey Taylor of Air Force. Southern California running back MarShawn Lloyd is also worth a look.\n\nWacker: Only if they fill all their other needs and/or if the players they want are off the board at that point. Then, if someone like Florida State's Jordan Travis falls to them, it would be good to snap him up.\n\nWalker: Never rule out a late-round quarterback, but it's not a priority given their need to add young depth in the secondary, on the edges of their defense and at running back. Remember, Huntley was an undrafted free agent. It seems more likely the Ravens will go that route to add another arm for training camp.\n\nPreston: I would. It's always good to have four arms in training camp, primarily to keep the starter fresh. But the Ravens brought in Todd Monken as the offensive coordinator last season, so allow him to make a selection. If he can find a quarterback to work with in those rounds, that's a major positive for the future.\n\nWacker: A former colleague once described DeCosta as a .275 hitter with occasional pop, though that was also taking into account the totality of his work and before last year's draft and free agent signings. I'd go a bit higher and give him a B, given the immediate impact Flowers had last season, a highly successful 2022 class that included All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton, Pro Bowl center Tyler Linderbaum and fourth-round tight end Isaiah Likely. There have been several misses, too, particularly in the middle and late rounds, but no one has a high success rate in those rounds. And trading a second- and fifth-round draft pick for All-Pro inside linebacker Roquan Smith turned out to be a steal for Baltimore.\n\nWalker: DeCosta has yet to miss badly on a first-round pick, though the Ravens need a breakout year from Bateman for him to go down as a successful choice. Hamilton and Linderbaum both made the Pro Bowl in their second seasons, so the 2022 draft is DeCosta's magnum opus. The jury remains out on his 2023 class, with players such as Trenton Simpson and Andrew Vorhees in line for major opportunities this season. DeCosta has missed on plenty of later-round picks, as most general managers do, but he usually pulls at least one major value from the middle rounds, whether we're talking Justin Madubuike in 2020, Brandon Stephens in 2021 or Likely in 2022. Let's go B+ overall.\n\nPreston: B. DeCosta got off to a slow start, which was to be expected because the pressure is greater being in the GM's chair as opposed to being the top assistant. He has drafted some top players at their positions in Linderbaum, Hamilton and Madubuike while snagging some good mid- to late-round picks such as safety Geno Stone, punter Jordan Stout and Likely.\n\nThe Ravens have as much depth as any team in the NFL. They've proved it over the past four or five years.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_preston@baltimoresun.com",

With nine picks in this year's draft, the Ravens should be able to find players they like - and don't be surprised if they end up making a trade as well. Here is a mock draft with three options for each Ravens pick: one will be the perfect option for the pick, the second will be the more likely option, and finally, a wild card pick. They have a clear focus on certain positions of need, like the offensive line, but they have always been drafted by the \"best player available\" philosophy, and it has paid off for them in the past.Round 1 - Pick 30The Ravens are hoping to get an offensive tackle with this pick and this draft is full of intriguing prospects at the position. This year could set a record for offensive tackle prospects picked, with nine in the first round. The question is whether one will fall to the Ravens at pick No. 30. Ideal Pick - Amarius Mims -OT- Georgia Mims offers the perfect combination of physical abilities and future potential that the Ravens would jump for the chance to grab him this late in the first round. He also comes with familiarity of the offense as he played under offensive coordinator Todd Monken's system at the University of Georgia. He would be an immediate starter at right tackle and could eventually replace Ronnie Stanley on the left side. Probable Pick - Jordan Morgan - OT - ArizonaWith the probable run-on tackle prospects in the first round, Morgan will be the best one left and could be the record-setting ninth tackle taken in the first round. He is an athletic left tackle that excels in pass protection. The biggest issue is his strength and run blocking, two things the Ravens covet from their offensive lineman. One positive factor is they could possibly move back into the second round to pick Morgan, and add another draft pick.Wild Card Pick - Kool-Aid McKinstry - CB - AlabamaThis pick would mean that all the first-round caliber tackles are off the board, which would push some talented players down the draft like McKinstry. The Ravens have not been shy about picking players from the University of Alabama with the most draft picks in franchise history (12). He doesn't have elite speed but at his size (6'1\") he has shown enough to be ranked as a top-30 prospect.Round 2 - Pick 62Ideal Pick - Keon Coleman - WR - Florida StateIt would be a stretch for Coleman to fall this late in the second round, but if he falls to them this late in the second round, it would be a steal. He is a big-bodied receiver (6'3\" 213 lbs) that the Ravens are looking for and could be an option this late due to his slow 40-yard dash time at the NFL combine. Coleman ran 4.61 seconds 40, which is considered slow for a top-level receiver. He was clocked the fastest among receivers during the gauntlet drill of the combine, so maybe his speed translates to the field and not the stopwatch. Probable Pick - T.J. Tampa - CB - Iowa StateIf the Ravens manage to snag one of the tackles with the first pick, then their focus should be on the defensive side of the ball for the second pick. Tampa is a big corner (6'1\") and has decent speed and is known for his press coverage skills. He is an aggressive corner who takes chances that can be both helpful and hurtful. He has been ranked in the top 50 and could be an eventual replacement for Marlon Humphrey, who turns 28 this year.Wild Card - Chris Braswell - Edge - AlabamaThe Ravens should take a good look at another Alabama defensive player in Braswell. The Baltimore native was a highly recruited high school prospect and, despite limited playing time at Alabama, is getting high marks for his athleticism and high motor. He would need some work on his pass-rushing technique, but he is good in coverage. Under the right coaching, he could develop into an elite pass rusher and could be the first Baltimore native on the Ravens since cornerback Kyle Fuller.Round 3 - Pick 93Ideal Pick - Blake Corum - RB - MichiganCorum is another player the Ravens should be familiar with on many different levels. He just won a National Championship at the University of Michigan under the coaching of Jim Harbaugh, brother of Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. He also played his high school football in Baltimore at St. Frances Academy and was the 2018 Gatorade Maryland Football Player of the Year. Corum is a smaller back who is known for his lateral quickness and would be a good compliment to Dereck Henry while offering some insurance as Keaton Mitchell recovers from a knee injury. Probable Pick - Devontez Walker - WR - North CarolinaWalker is an incredible combination of size (6'2\") and speed (4.36 40-time) that is usually grabbed earlier than the end of the third round. This year's deep receiver group and Walker's flaws should push him toward the Raven's pick at 93. He is primarily known as a deep threat but needs to work on his route running in the short to intermediate routes. He could be the perfect down-field complement to Zay Flowers but would need some work to excel at the next level. Walker has as much upside as some of the first-round receivers and would be well worth a late third-round pick.Wild Card - Christian Jones- OT - TexasIf the Ravens miss out on an offensive tackle with their first two picks, it is unlikely they would pass on one with their third pick. Jones has received a wide range of scouting grades and has been projected from a third to fifth-round pick. He has the size and strength to be a tackle, but his pass protection will need some work at the next level. He may also work at the guard position, another need for the Ravens. Jones would be another project pick that would need time to develop, but if he is available at pick No. 93, his high ceiling would be worth the pick.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens face an important draft this year after falling short in the AFC Championship and losing multiple players to free agency and trades this offseason.\n\nThey are looking to retool the offensive line as well as add depth at the corner and receiver position, and luckily, this draft could be perfect to fill those needs.

They don't chase need, but their early-round picks usually address their bigger roster questions. They covet draft picks and often are aggressive in trading back and collecting more.\n\nGeneral manager Eric DeCosta is also not afraid to throw a few curveballs.\n\nWhen the three-day NFL Draft starts Thursday night, the Ravens will be sitting on nine picks, including No. 30 in the first round. They need offensive line and cornerback help. Wide receiver and edge rusher are again areas of concern. DeCosta has all but guaranteed that he'll draft a running back. Depth would come in handy at inside linebacker and safety.\n\nThis isn't an especially deep draft, and DeCosta has acknowledged that the Ravens' board has fewer \"draftable\" players than usual. But the strengths of this draft class, particularly with the offensive linemen and wide receivers, match up well with areas Baltimore needs to address.\n\nThe Ravens don't reveal much this time of year, so it's often necessary to connect the dots, based on their needs, drafting history and the players available. Let's do just that.\n\nThat the Ravens are on the clock at No. 30 and DeCosta has his choice between one of the better offensive tackles, one of the better cornerbacks and a trade-back scenario that nets Baltimore more picks. Of the offensive linemen, Notre Dame's Joe Alt, Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga, Washington's Troy Fautanu and Penn State's Olu Fashanu will almost certainly be gone before No. 30. If Alabama's JC Latham, Georgia's Amarius Mims or Oklahoma's Tyler Guyton happened to fall, that would be a nice development for the Ravens.\n\nAs for the cornerbacks, Alabama's Terrion Arnold and Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell are expected to go in the first half of the first round, but one or two of Iowa's Cooper DeJean, Clemson's Nate Wiggins and Alabama's Kool-Aid McKinstry should be available. A choice between -- let's say -- Mims, DeJean and a trade-back offer that yields an extra Day 2 pick would be a great position for DeCosta to be in.\n\nThat the Ravens are on the clock and no players they have a first-round grade on are available and DeCosta's phone isn't ringing with trade offers, forcing Baltimore to overdraft a player it views as second-round talent. We don't know how the Ravens' board stacks up and how many players they have first-round grades on, but it figures to be considerably less than 30. It's plausible the Ravens will be out of first-round players by the time they're on the clock. Their preference then would be to trade back, but DeCosta's phone has to ring and Baltimore won't want to move too far into the second round, either.\n\nGuyton and/or Mims and Arizona offensive lineman Jordan Morgan will be available to fill the team's plug-and-play tackle needs, and so will at least one of DeJean, Wiggins or McKinstry at cornerback. There will also be edge rush and wide receiver options. DeCosta will have trade-back opportunities, too, and he'll weigh how much he loves the top remaining player on his board with how much the Ravens covet more prime draft capital.\n\nMissouri's Darius Robinson plays like a Raven. He's big (6-foot-5, 285 pounds), strong and physical -- and evaluators rave about his character. Robinson, who had 8 1/2 sacks and 14 tackles for loss last year, offers versatility with the ability to play on the edge and bump inside in certain packages. The Ravens watched him star at the Senior Bowl and brought him to Baltimore for a pre-draft visit. The Ravens have bigger needs than their defensive front, but adding versatile and disruptive players is always on the mind of the team's decision-makers.\n\nDuke's Graham Barton. He was a second-team All-American left tackle for the Blue Devils, but he's expected to play center in the NFL. The Ravens don't need a center with Tyler Linderbaum on the roster. They do, however, need a right tackle and starting-caliber guards. Barton is more than capable of playing those positions.\n\nIllinois defensive tackle Johnny Newton. With Justin Madubuike, Michael Pierce, Broderick Washington, Travis Jones and Brent Urban returning, the Ravens could line up for a game today and feel good about their defensive line. However, they believe in building the team from the inside out, and they're always looking to add impactful defensive linemen. With a combination of explosiveness and power, Newton is tough to handle inside. He knows how to use leverage and has a nice array of pass-rushing moves, evidenced by his 7 1/2 -sack 2023 season. Newton also blocked four kicks last year and didn't miss a game in his final four seasons.\n\nIt isn't clear how the Ravens rank the offensive tackle prospects. But if one of the better ones, like Fuaga, Fashanu or Fautanu, is available in the low 20s, DeCosta may have to consider trading up. The Ravens reportedly brought Fautanu in for a pre-draft visit, an interesting move given the expectation that he gets drafted relatively early. They have several needs and only three picks over the first two days, so it seems unlikely they'd be willing to mortgage a ton of draft capital to move up. However, a trade to get into the low 20s that could cost them an extra third- and fourth-round pick might be an acceptable price for a stud offensive tackle.\n\nMiami is drafting at No. 21 and doesn't have a third- or fourth-round pick. The Dolphins could be interested in moving back and collecting midround draft capital. Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman, whose team is picking at No. 22, is always aggressive in moving around the board. The Dallas Cowboys, picking 24th, are a team to watch, too.\n\nIt's been widely speculated that the Washington Commanders, who have the fourth (No. 36) and eighth (No. 40) picks in the second round, are interested in trading back into the first and selecting an offensive tackle to pair with the quarterback they'll take at No. 2. Washington has two seconds and three thirds, so it has plenty of ammunition to move forward.\n\nGoing back to No. 36 or No. 40 would keep the Ravens in the mix for a player they were considering at No. 30, and it would put them in good range for one of the better wide receivers, like Texas' Adonai Mitchell and Xavier Worthy, Georgia's Ladd McConkey, Florida State's Keon Coleman and South Carolina's Xavier Legette. It would also make sense if the Carolina Panthers, who possess the first (No. 33) and seventh (No. 39) selections of the second round, want to get into the first to select a receiver.\n\nThe Ravens will be hoping six quarterbacks go in the first 29 picks. Four (Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye and J.J. McCarthy) are almost certain to. If Washington's Michael Penix Jr. and Oregon's Bo Nix also go in the first round, the Ravens will have to feel good about one of their top-20 players being there at No. 30.\n\nMiami safety Kamren Kinchens doesn't have elite speed or athleticism, but he's always around the ball. He had 11 interceptions and 22 pass breakups over his final two college seasons. An instinctive and rangy safety with good ball skills, touted leadership ability and strong special teams experience sounds like an ideal midround Ravens add.\n\nIt has to be the status of the offensive line. The Ravens have a 30-year-old left tackle in Ronnie Stanley, who has missed a ton of time over the past four seasons, a stud center in Linderbaum and questions about the other three starting spots. Patrick Mekari has proven he can play good football at multiple spots. Ben Cleveland has been adequate when he's started at guard. The Ravens still believe Daniel Faalele can develop into a starting tackle. They have high hopes for now-healthy guard Andrew Vorhees. Still, there's a lot undecided in an area where the Ravens need to excel in front of quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nHow much do the Ravens believe in Rashod Bateman and their current wide receiver corps? DeCosta and coach John Harbaugh have talked up Bateman, a 2021 first-round pick, all offseason. DeCosta has downplayed the need at wide receiver. In free agency, the Ravens acted like a team content with the trio of Zay Flowers, Bateman and Nelson Agholor, and allowing younger pass catchers to fill in behind them. But this is an especially strong receiver class. Despite using more draft capital on the position than any team since 2019, the Ravens again have a need.\n\nThere are four receivers considered first-round locks, and then the second round should spur a run at wide receiver that continues through Day 2. If the Ravens are mostly content with what they have at the position, they can show a little patience and get a guy they like late in the third round or early in the fourth. If not, they may have to earmark their second-round pick for a pass catcher.\n\nIt's not clear whether the Ravens even have a No. 3 safety on their roster to play behind Marcus Williams and Kyle Hamilton. Ar'Darius Washington is the most logical candidate, but the Ravens have preferred using him in the slot. They love the option of playing three safeties, like they had last year with Geno Stone on the roster. It allowed them to move Hamilton around. The Ravens probably will sign a veteran safety after the draft, but they could use another starting-caliber option -- and the younger, the better.\n\nDeCosta answered this one at the pre-draft news conference when he said, \"There is probably a pretty strong chance that we will draft a running back.\" The Ravens have a top-two of Derrick Henry and Justice Hill. Keaton Mitchell, who burst on the scene last year, is rehabbing a major knee injury sustained in December. The Ravens need to prepare like he won't be ready or back to form for the start of the season. If he is, that's a bonus. The only other running back on their roster is 2023 undrafted free agent Owen Wright. Injuries seem to hit the running back room hard every year, and the Ravens need more depth there.\n\nBusy. Baltimore only has 60 players on its roster. Even if they draft 10 players, the Ravens will still have as many as 20 spots available for undrafted free agents.

Instead of looking for the dominant, physical maulers up front, they should seek versatile performers who can balance run and pass blocking.\n\nIn recent seasons, the Ravens have been one of the best -- if not the best -- in the NFL at running the ball, but they can't get to the Super Bowl because of their inability to protect quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nIt hasn't mattered who has lined up under center, the results have been the same. In the gut-wrenching wild-card playoff loss to the Cincinnati Bengals two seasons ago, backup Tyler Huntley was sacked twice and hit five times.\n\nIn the 17-10 AFC championship game loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs, Jackson was sacked four times in a game that was reminiscent of the 23-17 wild-card-round loss to the Los Angeles Chargers after his breakthrough 2018 rookie season.\n\nThe Ravens should stress more versatility with their offensive linemen and draft players who can do more than maul people in the running game. There are several holes to fill, including both guard spots and right tackle. This draft presents them with several opportunities to find a starter, or more than one.\n\n\"It's a very deep pool of players,\" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said of the offensive linemen class in this draft, which begins Thursday night in Detroit. \"We see a lot of different opportunities in different rounds to get players at tackle, guard and center, and we're excited about that.\"\n\nIt's still possible that the Ravens might want to trade down from their No. 30 overall spot in the first round to acquire more picks in later rounds or for next year's draft, which is already considered to be one of the strongest in a while. They might also want to select a receiver or a cornerback, but filling out the offensive line is the more pressing need.\n\nOne of the main reasons the Ravens have struggled in the postseason is because they either can't keep pace with opposing quarterbacks or have panicked out of fear.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Ravens have to face quarterbacks such as the Kansas City Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes or the Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen. The Houston Texans' C.J. Stroud isn't going away and the Chargers' Justin Herbert, with new coach Jim Harbaugh, should be formidable.\n\nThose quarterbacks excel in the passing game, and a 10-point lead might seem insurmountable against some of those top signal-callers. That's what happened to the Ravens in the AFC title game -- Baltimore panicked and its top two running backs, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill, had only six rushing attempts.\n\nThe Ravens' struggles haven't just been in the postseason, either. For most of the 2023 regular season, right tackle Morgan Moses had problems with speed rushers. Left tackle Ronnie Stanley was constantly overpowered.\n\nThe Ravens traded Moses in March to the New York Jets in exchange for draft picks, and Stanley's monstrous contract was renegotiated to make it more salary cap friendly. The Ravens also lost their two starting guards in free agency in John Simpson to the Jets and right guard Kevin Zeitler to the Lions.\n\nSo, rebuilding on the offensive line and protecting their star quarterback is the priority. The Ravens might have some capable replacements in 6-foot-8, 380-pound right tackle Daniel Faalele and 6-6, 370-pound right guard Ben Cleveland, but neither bend well at the knees and have struggled in pass protection in limited action.\n\nPerhaps if both have strong offseasons in the weight room, that will change. Stanley, in his ninth season, has struggled since his 2020 ankle injury and his best years are probably behind him.\n\nThat leaves the Ravens with Pro Bowl center Tyler Linderbaum, swing lineman Patrick Mekari and possibly Andrew Vorhees, who missed all of his rookie season while recovering from an injury, as their starting left guard. Merkari can play any position on the line, but his body probably can't hold up for an entire season as a starter. He's more valuable in his current role.\n\nVorhees, who had a stellar career at Southern California before the Ravens selected him in the seventh round, might be a sleeper. He was projected to be a fourth-round pick before tearing his ACL at the scouting combine.\n\n\"Andrew was a guy that I've seen on tape, and I thought that he was a good player and that he would have a chance long term to be a player for us and be a starter for us potentially,\" DeCosta said. \"He's a physical, tough guy that loves football. He's done a fantastic job with rehab. The strength coaches and the trainers and the doctors are all very excited about him. So, we'll see what he does.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the Ravens do in the first round. According to some draft experts, there could be as many as 10 offensive tackles taken in the first round. The Ravens might end up with Alabama's JC Latham, Oklahoma's Tyler Guyton or Georgia's Amarius Mims.\n\nAll could help immediately, and all of them are huge. The Ravens certainly have some inside connections with executive vice president of player personnel Ozzie Newsome being an Alabama alumnus and offensive coordinator Todd Moknen having spent three years in the same capacity at Georgia.\n\nAfter a tackle, the Ravens might target a guard, such as Kansas State's Cooper Beebe or Connecticut's Christian Haynes, in the second round. Regardless, though, the Ravens need to get out of that old-school mindset when it comes to evaluating offensive linemen.\n\nThey had the prototype for years in Hall of Fame left tackle Jonathan Ogden, who was far from one-dimensional. They also had another possible Hall of Famer in right guard Marshal Yanda who, like Ogden, was mean, nasty and preferred run blocking over being in a pass set.\n\nBut they could do both. The Ravens need more linemen like them.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_preston@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Mike

The eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs knocked off Baltimore 17-10 in a game that showed the Ravens are lacking a certain something to get them over the hump vs. championship level teams.\n\nThe task for Ravens GM Eric DeCosta and Head Coach Jim Harbaugh will be to identify and select the players to help Lamar Jackson and the rest of the Ravens to exorcise their playoff demons in 2024-2025, as challenging and daunting as that may seem at the moment. Recently, the Ravens' full seven-round mock draft was released. It was released during a time in which Jackson's status as a free agent certified superstar QB was doubted by Cam Newton.\n\nThe Ravens pick 30th this Thursday in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, with many theories and predictions being shared about what the Ravens' dynamic duo will do at that position.\n\nHere are three bold last-minute predictions on who the Ravens will go for in the 2024 NFL Draft and how each might affect Baltimore going forward:\n\n1. The Ravens Will Draft Kool-Aid McKinstry-\n\nThe versatile Alabama Crimson Tide defensive back's game tape will prove too good for Coach Harbaugh and company to pass up with pick number 30, even though the Ravens desperately need more playmakers for Jackson.\n\nMcKinstry's situation is reminiscent of Brian Branch's in last year's draft. Every GM worth his salt knew Branch was better than a second round caliber player but he still fell that far, perhaps because of the resounding draft fatigue of GMs selecting Alabama players in the first round of the draft.\n\nBranch would have had a first round grade in any other recent season but fell into the Lions' laps for this or perhaps another reason. It also seemed as if Branch's versatility and dominance in Nick Saban's Crimson Tide secondary worked against him because it all seemed too good to be true.\n\nMcKinstry falls under that same umbrella. The Tide ran into a buzzsaw named the Michigan Wolverines in last year's Rose Bowl and still almost beat a team with 17 likely NFL Draft picks, even led by young QB Jalen Milroe.\n\nMcKinstry's defense was dominant, and he will be a versatile and dominant defense back at the next level. The Ravens would be foolish to pass him up if he falls to pick number 30, which looks like a serious possibility at this point in time.\n\n2. The Ravens Will Select a Running Back-\n\nStandout youngster Keaton Mitchell showed flashes of promise and skill last season, rushing for nearly 400 yards for the Ravens in 2023-2024. Expect GM Eric DeCosta and John Harbaugh to put their heads together and to come up with a plan for selecting another runner to rotate in behind Derrick Henry next season.\n\nMitchell has talent, but the Ravens need a backup with additional size and durability who can carry the ball 10-15 times and get the tough yards between the tackles.\n\nOne such prospect is Michigan standout Blake Corum. Corum isn't a physical marvel like Henry but he is built low to the ground, has tree trunks for legs and is as solid and dependable as they get in the running game. John Harbaugh's brother Jim has been knowto poach his players lately both in the college and NFL ranks.\n\nJohn could take a page out of Jim's book and select Corum, or he could opt for another lesser-known but still very talented alternative like Braelon Allen of the University of Wisconsin, a slippery and explosive big-play back who quietly carried on the Badgers' tradition of star running backs in Madison last fall.\n\n3. Lamar Jackson Will Get a New Weapon at Receiver or Tight End-\n\nThe Ravens have had success in selecting wideouts Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman in recent years. Even so, improvements are needed in the passing game.\n\nBaltimore has been projected to select Adonai Mitchell of Texas in the first round, and he would be a great selection. If the Ravens do go with defense at pick 30, several great options abound later in the draft including Roman Wilson of Michigan, an underrated, shifty receiver who is a great blocker and clutch player. Other sleepers at the position include Ja'Lynn Polk of Washington, Ladd McConkey of Georgia and Xavier Worthy of Texas, all of whom would provide an entirely new dimension to the Ravens' passing offense for the team to rely on in the biggest games vs. the most stingy opponents.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Surely mammoth offensive tackles Amarius Mims and Tyler Guyton will generate strong consideration if either are available when the Ravens go on the clock. Late rising lineman Kingsley Suamataia could also be the selection if Baltimore is dead-set on a blocker.\n\nHowever, it would be hard to pass on the rarely available athletic profiles and difference-making skillsets of wideout Adonai Mitchell and cornerback Nate Wiggins. Ultimately, I'll predict general manager Eric DeCosta picks \"solid-double\" Alabama cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry to solidify a pass defense that was hit hard by free agent defections.\n\n- Vasilis Lericos\n\nThe Ravens should have plenty of options available to them at No. 30 overall, including suitors to trade back with and acquire extra draft picks. However, should they stay put and make a selection, they'll inevitably draft the best player on their board. Offensive tackle has been the most popular projection for the Ravens' first round pick and for good reason. They badly need a starting-caliber player at right tackle and potential long-term solution on the left side. The Ravens have not drafted an offensive tackle in the first round since taking Ronnie Stanley in 2016. Similarly, they haven't drafted a cornerback in Round 1 since 2017.\n\nWhile drafting a corner is also a real possibility, I believe the Ravens will stay true to their expressed desire to retool and upgrade their offensive line. Eric DeCosta will dip back into the Oklahoma Sooner well and draft Tyler Guyton, who can be a cornerstone piece at the position. If Guyton is gone by pick No. 30, the next best offensive tackle -- such as Jordan Morgan or Armarius Mims -- seem like probable options as well.\n\n- Frank Platko\n\nThe Ravens most glaring need remains on the offensive line and, in particular, at tackle where they have a vacancy on the right side up for grabs. They might have another opening following the 2024 season when current franchise blindside protector Ronnie Stanley's contract is set to expire. Although both starting guard spots are also open, the Ravens have several promising in-house options who were recently drafted and will get a chance to compete.\n\nWith all that being stated, I believe the Ravens will go with a defensive back with their first pick if Iowa's Cooper DeJean or Alabama's Kool-Aid McKinstry are still available when they come on the clock. Don't be surprised if one of them ends up hearing their names called over one of the projected offensive tackle prospects who have been popularly mocked to them the past few months such as Arizona's Jordan Morgan, Oklahoma's Tyler Guyton or Georgia's Amaruis Mims. Cornerback wasn't their biggest need in 2017 when they selected Marlon Humphrey No. 16 overall but they like to rotate their top three at the spot regardless of health status and know all too well what a lack of quality cornerback depth can cost them when it comes to final stretch of the regular season and in the playoffs.\n\nI could see them bypassing tackle in the first round and either sticking and picking whoever falls to No. 62 overall in the second or trading one of their fourth rounders this year or a 2025 pick to move up to take one of the offensive tackles still remaining early on Day 2.\n\n- Joshua Reed\n\nLet's be honest. For the most, the Ravens are pretty chalk, especially during the first round. They stick in their spot and draft the best player left 95% of the time. This year will probably be no different. The obvious choice is Jordan Morgan, who they've been linked to for the past month, or a trade back. But I think the Ravens surprise us a little.\n\nThe defense has been ravaged. Their defensive coordinator, secondary coach, and defensive line coach are gone. Patrick Queen, Geno Stone, Jadeveon Clowney, Ronald Darby are also gone. I think one of Kool-Aid McKinstry or Cooper DeJean will remain when the Ravens pick at 30. That will be the pick.\n\nNobody loves corners more than the Ravens (and me). They remind everybody of that with their highest drafted corner since Marlon Humphrey in 2017. Their highest pick since then has been Anthony Averett at 118 (Brandon Stephens at 104 doesn't count, he was drafted as a safety then). They quickly supplement their defense with an instant starter and help their first year defensive coordinator Zach Orr.\n\n- Zach Canter\n\nThe Ravens have, for the most part, hit the first round of the NFL Draft out of the park the last few years. In 2022, they drafted two Pro-Bowlers in the first round in safety Kyle Hamilton and center Tyler Linderbaum. At the time, these picks were controversial. They weren't positions of immediate need or \"premium positions\". Two years later, and the NFL still is wondering how players like Hamilton and Linderbaum were there for the Ravens taking.\n\nWith no positions of immediate need, I expect the Ravens to stick to their best player available philosophy and take Iowa corner Cooper DeJean with pick No. 30. The Ravens absolutely love versatile defenders and DeJean is about as versatile as it gets on defense, displaying the ability to play in the nickel, outside, and at safety. A defense with Kyle Hamilton, Roquan Smith, and DeJean would be about as versatile as you can get and solidify the Baltimore secondary for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com",

Save for a few \"tweaks,\" as general manager Eric DeCosta put it earlier this month, they have a pretty good idea of whom they will draft at No. 30 in the first round and beyond, with adjustments made along the way based on who's still available.\n\nUnlike last year, when Baltimore entered the draft with just five picks -- its fewest since 1999 -- DeCosta has nine selections this time.\n\nGiven the various holes on the roster after more than a dozen players from last year's 13-4 team headed elsewhere because of free agency or other moves, the Ravens will need every one of them.\n\nIf they are to compete for another AFC North title and their first Super Bowl appearance in more than a decade, they have to find several players who can contribute as rookies, and in some cases significantly so. That's just one reason DeCosta could look to add even more picks to this year's haul with a draft day trade or two, with the belief that the more picks he has, the more likely he can find players who can make an immediate impact.\n\n\"It's great to have additional picks,\" DeCosta said during the team's predraft news conference two weeks ago. \"You certainly have to have players that you covet and that you want to draft. So, that's always a factor with every draft.\n\n\"I always think about it as, 'What picks do you need to get the players that you want to take?' You can have some great picks, but if the board doesn't fall the right way, and you're looking at a bunch of players that aren't any better than the players you have on your roster, those picks don't really help you very much. I like the idea of having more picks, but I want to have more picks in a specific range in the draft. If we can get that done, then I could see us being in a good position to really maximize our chances to find good players.\"\n\nIn terms of those players and what the Ravens need most, here's a look at the positions they're most likely to fill in the draft, which begins Thursday night in Detroit.\n\nWith three starters from last season's line having departed via free agency or trade, this is easily the Ravens' biggest need in terms of sheer volume. Gone are guards John Simpson and Kevin Zeitler, signing lucrative deals with the New York Jets and Detroit Lions, respectively, while right tackle Morgan Moses was dealt to the Jets in a draft pick swap.\n\nCoach John Harbaugh said earlier this month that there are \"absolutely\" young players already on the roster who can step in, but all of them have question marks.\n\nIs Daniel Faalele ready to take a sizable leap forward in Year 3 to become an every-down starter at tackle? Did Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu improve enough from his rookie year after getting beaten out by Simpson last summer? How will guard Andrew Vorhees fare after missing his rookie season because of a torn ACL? Baltimore has versatile veterans in Patrick Mekari and Josh Jones, but they are mostly rotational players.\n\nThe good news for Baltimore is that the two deepest positions of this draft class are offensive line and wide receiver. The Ravens have also drafted at least two offensive linemen in six of the past eight drafts, so don't expect this one to be any different.\n\nThere's certainly an argument to be made that this is the Ravens' biggest need, with second-year receiver Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman and unspectacular but dependable veteran Nelson Agholor the top three on the depth chart and the group thin after that.\n\nThe only other receivers on the roster are Tylan Wallace, who has played mostly on special teams his first three seasons, and Sean Ryan, who played zero snaps as a rookie last year. The good news is, it's a deep class.\n\nThere should be plenty of opportunities for the Ravens to add an immediate contributor to this group, whether that's early in the draft or in the middle rounds. Given the abundance of offensive linemen and receivers, it's possible Baltimore could trade out of the first round, acquire an extra pick or two and bolster both positions.\n\nThe Ravens made a smart decision to bring back veteran outside linebacker Kyle Van Noy, who had a career-high nine sacks last season. Signed for $9 million over two years, he's a much more affordable option than Jadeveon Clowney, whom the Carolina Panthers are paying $20 million over two seasons after he recorded 9 1/2 sacks for the Ravens last year.\n\nThere are questions about the rest of the Ravens' pass rushers, though, including whether Odafe Oweh can somehow find consistency in Year 4 and if David Ojabo can remain healthy after essentially missing his first two seasons because of injuries.\n\nBaltimore has a history of signing veteran pass rushers during the summer and it's a route they'll likely take again with some options still out there, including Emmanuel Ogbah, Yannick Ngakoue and Shaq Lawson. Unlike the offensive line and wide receiver class, this is not a deep draft or even one with high-end talent.\n\nConsider the strong chance that the top pass rushers will likely be off the board before the Ravens are on the clock, and it's less likely they'll find a major contributor via the draft.\n\nThe Ravens are in good shape with Marlon Humphrey and Brandon Stephens on the outside and Arthur Maulet returning in the slot. Baltimore also signed free agent Ka'Dar Hollman, though the 29-year-old has just two starts across three seasons and has mostly played special teams and as a depth piece in the defensive backfield.\n\nBeyond that, the group, much like the receiving corps, is thin.\n\nThings only get more concerning when factoring in Humphrey's age (he turns 28 in July), recent injuries (foot and calf in 2023) and pricey contract ($22.8 million cap hit in 2024). Stephens, meanwhile, is set to become a free agent after this upcoming season and could become cost-prohibitive given rising contract figures and other players who will become extension-eligible at the same time, notably All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton and Pro Bowl center Tyler Linderbaum.\n\nDamarion \"Pepe\" Williams and Jalyn Armour-Davis, meanwhile, have struggled to be consistent, both in their play and ability to stay on the field.\n\nThe Ravens like to say they take a \"best player available\" approach in the draft, and a cornerback such as Alabama's Kool-Aid McKinstry might check that box near the end of Round 1.\n\nMuch like cornerback, Baltimore has no concern with its top two players at the position, Hamilton and Marcus Williams. But the Ravens like to use three safeties, and Geno Stone's departure to the AFC North rival Cincinnati Bengals leaves a void.\n\nThe Ravens have Ar'Darius Washington, but he was used primarily in the slot last season. Stephens, originally tabbed for a safety role last year, gives them flexibility, but moving him would stress the outside.\n\nIf either Hamilton or Williams gets injured, as the latter did last year, there would be a big problem. Adding another player to the rotation either in free agency or the draft makes sense.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

DeCosta and the team disguise their draft intentions so much -- and are not against throwing out some smoke screens -- that it's always hard to get a good read on their targets.\n\nTaking into account their needs, the location of their picks, pre-draft meetings and drafting history, below is a look at some players who could interest Baltimore each day. It's not meant to be conclusive.\n\n(The Ravens have one pick in the first round at No. 30)\n\nCooper DeJean, CB, Iowa: The Ravens love versatile defensive backs, and DeJean can play outside, in the slot and he can play safety. He's a physical tackler, explosive blitzer and a ball hawk with seven college interceptions and three pick sixes. DeJean is also a dangerous return man. The Ravens love Iowa players, too.\n\nTyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma: Guyton (6-foot-7, 328 pounds) has an extremely high ceiling due to his athleticism and range. He didn't play a ton of college football, so he has plenty of developing to do. Yet, the physical attributes are all there and he'd be a nice solution to Baltimore's right tackle vacancy.\n\nKool-Aid McKinstry, CB, Alabama: The last time the Ravens picked a cornerback in the first round was Marlon Humphrey in 2017. Humphrey also went to Alabama. Smart, athletic and durable, McKinstry plays with strong fundamentals and discipline. He doesn't have elite speed, but his length, competitiveness and technique should allow him to play a major role from the jump.\n\nAmarius Mims, OT, Georgia: In a similar boat as Guyton, Mims started just eight games in college and battled some injuries. At 6-foot-7 and 330 pounds, he has ideal size and length for an NFL right tackle. He also plays with power and awareness. It would be a surprise if he was still available at No. 30.\n\nAdonai Mitchell, WR, Texas: Big (6-foot-4, 192 pounds) and fast (4.34 40-yard dash time), Mitchell can challenge defenses in every quadrant of the field. He averaged 15.4 yards per reception at Texas and totaled 18 touchdowns in 35 college games. Mitchell started his career at Georgia, where he played under current Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken.\n\nJordan Morgan, OT/G, Arizona: Arguably the best of the second-tier offensive tackle options, Morgan is probably the player most often connected to the Ravens in mock drafts. He's not a mauler at 6-foot-4 and 312 pounds, but he's athletic and plays with good footwork and fundamentals. He was mostly a left tackle at Arizona.\n\nJer'Zhan Newton, DL, Illinois: The Ravens don't have a strong need for an interior defensive lineman, but Newton could be the classic best player available pick. A two-time All-American at Illinois, Newton is undersized at 6-foot-1 and 304 pounds, but he plays with notable power, quickness and explosiveness. He had 13 sacks and 22 1/2 tackles for loss over his final two college seasons.\n\nChop Robinson, OLB, Penn State: A Gaithersburg, Md., native, Robinson is an intriguing mix of speed, explosiveness and power. At 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, he has room to grow, too. He was a hot name in the pre-draft process, and it doesn't appear that teams are overly concerned about his modest college production (11 1/2 sacks in 30 games).\n\nDarius Robinson, OLB, Missouri: At 6-foot-5, 285 pounds, Darius Robinson is a physical specimen. He also had solid production in his final college season with 8 1/2 sacks and 14 tackles for loss. Robinson, who can rush on the edge and then move inside in sub packages, had a top-30 visit with the Ravens.\n\nNate Wiggins, CB, Clemson: The Ravens have a type for early-round corners. They love long and athletic cornerbacks who can run, and that's Wiggins. He's 6-foot-2, 185 pounds and clocked a 4.28 time in the 40-yard dash. Wiggins allowed only one catch over 20 yards in his final college season. He also had two defensive touchdowns and a blocked kick.\n\n(The Ravens have one pick in the second round at No. 62 and one pick in the third at No. 93)\n\nAustin Booker, OLB, Kansas: Booker was a subpackage player and didn't log a ton of college snaps, so most evaluations of him start with his potential. He lacks bulk at 6-foot-4, 253 pounds, but he's a good athlete and has a solid pass-rushing plan. He had eight sacks last year despite starting only one game. He was at the Ravens' facility for a top-30 visit.\n\nBrandon Coleman, OT/G, TCU: Dane Brugler, The Athletic's lead draft analyst, wrote this on Coleman: \"He looks and plays like a brawler.\" Coleman is 6-foot-4 and 313 pounds and uses his size best in the run game. He played both tackle and guard in college, so he offers positional flexibility.\n\nMalachi Corley, WR, Western Kentucky: He's so dynamic with the ball in his hands that he's garnered the nickname, \"The YAC King.\" Corley is an all-purpose threat who made a living in college on screens and quick-hitter passes. Corley had 22 touchdowns over his final two college seasons. He was one of the Ravens' top-30 visits.\n\nBlake Corum, RB, Michigan: Corum went to high school in Baltimore and played at Michigan, both factors making him an intriguing fit for the Ravens. He's also the type of hard-running and decisive back the team covets. It seems more likely the Ravens will draft a running back on Day 3, but Corum would be an interesting midround selection.\n\nBlake Fisher, OT, Notre Dame: A big (6-foot-5, 310 pounds) and athletic blocker with long arms and quick feet, Fisher has the chance to step in and start as a rookie. He has the type of measurables that teams look for, and he competes at a very high level. He was prone to lapses at times and needs to stay on top of his technique.\n\nChristian Haynes, G, Connecticut: Haynes, a Bowie, Md., native, is considered a plug-and-play guard who could come off the board earlier than expected. The 6-foot-2, 317-pounder moves well in space, is fundamentally sound and loves finishing blocks. He's also durable, starting every game over his final four college seasons.\n\nKamren Kinchens, S, Miami: His ball production jumps off the page. In his final two seasons with Miami, he had 11 interceptions and 11 pass breakups. He doesn't have elite speed or athleticism, but he has a knack for making plays and being in the right place at the right time. He'd be a nice fit for the Ravens' open No. 3 safety role.\n\nMax Melton, CB, Rutgers: His stock seemed to rise in the pre-draft process, and it's easy to see why. He's long (5-foot-11 and 187 pounds), fast (ran a 4.39 40-yard dash at the combine), has really good ball skills (eight interceptions, four fumble recoveries and 22 pass breakups), can play both inside and outside, and he's really good on special teams.\n\nMalik Mustapha, S, Wake Forest: The ex-Demon Deacon doesn't have ideal size (5-foot-10, 209 pounds) or length. He, however, fits the Ravens' defensive mold because of his physical and aggressive style. Mustapha is strong against the run and disciplined in coverage. He'd be a core special-teamer from the jump.\n\nJa'Lynn Polk, WR, Washington: Another pre-draft Ravens visitor, Polk caught 69 passes for 1,159 yards, averaged 16.8 yards per reception and scored 10 touchdowns in his final college season. He's not a burner, but he has really good hands and plays to his 6-foot-1, 203-pound size by winning jump balls and making contested catches.\n\nMike Sainristil, CB, Michigan: The Ravens have a far bigger need at outside cornerback than in the slot, where they bring back Arthur Maulet, Ar'Darius Washington and Damarion Williams. At 5-foot-9 and 183 pounds, Sainristil figures to be a slot cornerback in the NFL. Still, from ball skills (six interceptions last year) to instincts to toughness, Sainristil checks a lot of boxes for teams.\n\nKingsley Suamataia, OT, BYU: Suamataia played both left and right tackle in college and possesses a nice combination of size (6-foot-4, 329 pounds) and athleticism. There are questions about how high his ceiling is and how he'll handle speed rushers at the next level. With so many teams needing tackles, Suamataia could get pushed up some boards.\n\nDevontez Walker, WR, North Carolina: Walker is another wide receiver prospect who would diversify the Ravens' pass-catching group with his size (6-foot-1, 193 pounds) and speed (4.36 40-yard dash). He's a long strider who has shown an ability to create separation and get behind defenses. He averaged 16.8 yards per reception in his final college season.\n\n(The Ravens have two picks in the fourth round at Nos. 113 and 130; one pick in the fifth and sixth rounds at Nos. 165 and 218; and two picks in the seventh round at Nos. 228 and 250)\n\nBraelon Allen, RB, Wisconsin: Frequently connected to the Ravens in the pre-draft process, Allen rushed for just under 3,500 yards and had 35 touchdowns in three college seasons. He also became more involved in the Badgers' passing game. He's the youngest player in this draft class and doesn't turn 21 until January 2025. Fumbling was an issue at Wisconsin.\n\nJavon Baker, WR, UCF: An Alabama transfer, Baker ranked second in the FBS in yards per reception (21.9) in his final college season. Baker had issues with drops and consistency, but his size (6-foot-1, 202 pounds), athleticism and ball-tracking ability make him an intriguing prospect.\n\nTanor Bortolini, C/G, Wisconsin: Bortolini played nearly every offensive line position except left tackle at Wisconsin. A smart and fundamentally sound player, Bortolini could wind up as a full-time center in the NFL. The Ravens lost their backup center Sam Mustipher in free agency, and they could use more depth at the position.\n\nKhristian Boyd, DT, Northern Iowa: A top-30 visitor at the Ravens' facility, Boyd didn't put up much in the way of pass-rushing numbers at Northern Iowa. His career high was 3 1/2 sacks, which he had in two different college seasons. But the 6-foot-2, 329-pound nose tackle has some pass-rushing traits and is stout against the run.\n\nJermaine Burton, WR, Alabama: Burton started his college career at Georgia, where he crossed paths with Monken. A two-year starter at Alabama, Burton combines excellent speed with good body control to make tough catches. He didn't put up big numbers in college, but NFL teams are excited about his potential.\n\nAudric Estime, RB, Notre Dame: The 5-foot-11, 222-pound back can hurt teams with his physicality, speed and vision. He also showed a knack for finding the end zone with 29 touchdowns over his final two college seasons. Estime loves getting downhill, which would make him a nice fit in Baltimore's bruising running game.\n\nKhyree Jackson, CB, Oregon: The Alabama transfer made a lot of strides in his final college season, leading the Ducks with three interceptions and 10 pass breakups to go along with two sacks and five tackles for losses. A Prince George's County, Md., native, Jackson has a lot of developing to do, but his size, skill set and swagger make him an intriguing prospect.\n\nMohamed Kamara, OLB, Colorado State: Despite lacking ideal size (6-foot-1, 248 pounds) and length, Kamara could go higher than most pundits expect. You can't argue with his production, as he had 13 sacks and 17 tackles for loss in his final college season. He's a high-effort guy who could bring some juice as a situational rusher.\n\nJordan Magee, LB, Temple: Born in Towson, Md., Magee met with the Ravens during the pre-draft process. He's on the smaller side at 6-foot-1 and 228 pounds, and he'll have to prove he can shed blocks at the next level. However, he was around the ball a lot at Temple and plays with speed and range. He'd be a special teams contributor immediately.\n\nMason McCormick, G, South Dakota State: At 6-foot-4 and 309 pounds, McCormick is a mauler in the run game. While there might be questions about the level of competition he faced in college, McCormick started the final 57 games of his career and played in 70 total. He's a developmental guard who might not have to wait long to hear his name called on Day 3.\n\nTykee Smith, S, Georgia: Another smaller safety who plays bigger than his 5-foot-10, 202-pound size, Smith is an instinctual player who finds a way to make impactful plays. In his final collegiate season, he had four interceptions, 8 1/2 tackles for loss, two sacks and four pass breakups. The Ravens covet smart and physical defensive backs.\n\nQwan'Tez Stiggers, CB, CFL: Stiggers, who did not play college football but got himself on the draft radar with an impressive season for the Toronto Argonauts in the CFL, has been a source of great curiosity from NFL teams -- if his extensive list of pre-draft visits is any indication. Those visits include one hosted by the Ravens. He's understandably raw, but he's a long, athletic cornerback with good ball skills and an aggressive mentality.\n\nCaedan Wallace, OT, Penn State: He was a four-year starter at Penn State, exclusively playing right tackle. He's a good athlete at 6-foot-4 and 314 pounds, and he moves pretty well. An NFL team may find that he's a better fit inside. He has some upside because of his athleticism and physicality.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_zrebiec@theathletic.com",

After a dearth of picks in last year's draft, the Ravens have a healthy nine selections this year, beginning with No. 30 overall.\n\nGiven more than a dozen departures from last year's team and the financial breakdown of the current roster, this will be an important draft for Baltimore if it's going to match or surpass the success of last season when it reached the AFC championship game.\n\nHow could it unfold? While Ravens officials always have contingency plans, there's no way to take into account every option. Still, their needs -- offensive line, receiver, cornerback and edge rusher being the most obvious -- have been well-documented.\n\nUsing Pro Football Focus' simulator and taking into consideration Baltimore's needs along with other scouting and draft projection information, Baltimore Sun reporter Brian Wacker and editor C.J. Doon played the role of general manager and picked their own rookie class. Here's whom they took.\n\nNo. 30 (Round 1): Oklahoma OT Tyler Guyton\n\nIt would not be a surprise to see the Ravens trade out of this spot, either back into Round 2 or possibly up with the thought that the overall draft class is not as deep as they like. It is, however, a deep tackle class and staying put will give the Ravens someone they can plug in as a starter on the right side of the line this season and eventually move to the left side. If the 6-foot-8, 322-pound Guyton is still available here, they get a large and athletic player who immediately checks that box. He didn't allow a sack in more than 350 pass-blocking snaps at right tackle last season for the Sooners and would give quarterback Lamar Jackson the protection he needs for years to come.\n\nAlso considered: Arizona OT/G Jordan Morgan, Florida State WR Keon Coleman, Clemson CB Nate Wiggins\n\nNo. 62 (Round 2): South Carolina WR Xavier Legette\n\nBaltimore could go in several directions here. If the Ravens take a wide receiver or cornerback in the first round, expect them to go offensive line in the second. If they go offensive line in the first round, it seems like they will go with a cornerback or wide receiver in Round 2.\n\nThough the receiver class is deeper than the cornerback class, Legette (6-1, 221 pounds) is an NFL-sized target who can make contested catches and has tremendous speed, reaching 22.3 mph on one play last season. His route running isn't as smooth, but his size and ball skills give Jackson a great target opposite Zay Flowers, especially with Rashod Bateman's future murky if the Ravens decline his fifth-year option.\n\nAlso considered: Georgia CB Kamari Lassiter, Kansas State G Cooper Bebe, Western Kentucky WR Malachi Corley\n\nNo. 93 (Round 3): Oregon CB Khyree Jackson\n\nAs mentioned, I could certainly see the Ravens taking a cornerback before a wide receiver. But Jackson's size (6-3, 195 pounds) and physical nature make him an intriguing option, and here he falls into their lap in Round 3.\n\nThe Ravens are in good shape with Marlon Humphrey and Brandon Stephens on the outside, but they've made it clear they never have enough corners and Stephens will be a free agent after this season. Jackson is a reliable tackler who graded well against the run and is a Maryland native, having starred at Henry A. Wise High School in Upper Marlboro.\n\nAlso considered: Washington WR Jalen McMillan, Boston College G Christian Mahogany, Illinois OT/G Isaiah Adams\n\nNo. 113 (Round 4): Miami S Kamren Kinchens\n\nKinchens had a less-than-stellar scouting combine, turning in a 40-yard dash time of 4.65 seconds, which has caused him to possibly slide on some boards. But he brings athleticism, experience and good ball skills. He played in a dozen games as a freshman before taking over as the full-time starter in 2022 and 2023 and had 12 career interceptions, five of which came last season. With Geno Stone having bolted for the Bengals in free agency, Kinchens gives the Ravens a solid third safety option.\n\nAlso considered: Washington State EDGE Brennan Jackson, Wake Forest S Malik Mustapha, Georgia S Tykee Smith\n\nNo. 130 (Round 4): Washington State EDGE Brennan Jackson\n\nWith Baltimore having lost outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney in free agency and questions surrounding young pass rushers Odafe Oweh, David Ojabo and others, Jackson is the kind of player who fits the Ravens mold.\n\nThe 6-4, 264-pound sixth-year senior lacks refined pass-rush moves but plays fast and with high energy. He was always around the football for the Cougars and unsurprisingly led the team with 12 1/2 tackles for loss and 8 1/2 sacks last season while also forcing a fumble and recovering four. He consistently got to the quarterback with 26, 31 and 23 hurries over the past three seasons.\n\nAlso considered: Colorado State EDGE Mohamed Kamara, Notre Dame RB Audric Estim\u00e9, Temple LB Jordan Magee\n\nNo. 165 (Round 5): Temple LB Jordan Magee\n\nWith Trenton Simpson stepping in to take over for the departed Patrick Queen, the Ravens could use some depth behind last year's third-round pick.\n\nMagee, who is from Dover, Delaware, led the Owls with 80 tackles, including 14 for loss, tied for the team lead with 3 1/2 sacks, recorded four pass breakups and forced a fumble. He's also fast, with his 4.55-second 40-yard dash time ranking fifth among linebackers at the scouting combine.\n\nAlso considered: Clemson RB Will Shipley, Monmouth RB Jaden Shirden, Notre Dame LB Marist Liufau\n\nNo. 218 (Round 6): Marshall RB Rasheen Ali\n\nRavens general manager Eric DeCosta said during the team's predraft news conference earlier this month that there's a \"pretty strong chance\" that Baltimore would draft a running back. With Derrick Henry and Justice Hill their only healthy backs on the roster as Keaton Mitchell continues to recover from a torn ACL suffered in mid-December, there's also a need.\n\nAli had a predraft visit with the Ravens and there's a lot to like about the elusive 5-11, 206-pound back, who had 1,135 yards and 15 touchdowns on 212 carries last season. He also had 28 catches for 213 yards and another score. In other words, in some ways, he's this year's version of Mitchell until Mitchell is healthy enough to return.\n\nAlso considered: Michigan TE AJ Barner, Illinois TE Tip Reiman, Colorado State TE Dallin Hooker\n\nNo. 228 (Round 7): Northern Iowa DT Khristian Boyd\n\nDeCosta enjoys finding talent at small schools and Boyd also met with the Ravens on a predraft visit. The 6-4, 317-pound 24-year-old is a project to be sure, but if he sticks he would add depth behind Justin Madubuike, Broderick Washington and Travis Jones.\n\nBoyd's stock has also been rising since the Shrine Bowl, and his 38 reps on bench press during his pro day would've ranked second at the scouting combine.\n\nAlso considered: Mississippi DT Jaden Crumedy, Air Force S Trey Taylor, Tennessee CB Kamal Hadden\n\nNo. 250 (Round 7): Canadian Football League CB Qwan'Tez Stiggers\n\nSticking with the mantra that the Ravens can never have enough cornerbacks, they snag perhaps the most intriguing prospect of the draft. Stiggers essentially went from high school to semipro football to the CFL, overcoming tragedy along the way when his father was killed in a car accident.\n\nThe 5-11, 204-pound corner was the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie last year with the Toronto Argonauts after 53 tackles and five interceptions and ran a 4.45 in the 40-yard dash during his pro day last month. He also recently visited with the Ravens.\n\nAlso considered: Maryland OT Delmar Glaze, Florida Atlantic DT Evan Anderson, Iowa DT Logan Lee\n\nNo. 30 (Round 1): Arizona OT/G Jordan Morgan\n\nThe Ravens have no shortage of options in the first round, but I keep coming back to the offensive line. Sure, it's a deep class at the position, but how long are you willing to wait to find a potential starter?\n\nThe 6-5, 311-pound Morgan checks all the boxes for me. He's experienced (37 career starts at left tackle), athletic (seventh in athleticism score among tackles at the scouting combine) and resilient, playing through a high-ankle sprain in 2021 and coming back from a torn ACL suffered late in the 2022 season. Arizona offensive coordinator Brennan Carroll called him a \"fantastic role model.\"\n\nHis NFL future might be at guard -- a position the Ravens also need to fill -- but I'm willing to bet on the 22-year-old's athletic traits and intangibles to develop into a starting-caliber tackle.\n\nAlso considered: Florida State WR Keon Coleman, Alabama CB Kool-Aid McKinstry, Oregon C/G Jackson Powers-Johnson\n\nNo. 62 (Round 2): Kentucky CB Andru Phillips\n\nThe run on receivers and cornerbacks in the second round took some of my favorite prospects off the board, but I'm not going to call Phillips a consolation prize.\n\nWhat the 5-11, 190-pound corner lacks in size and speed (4.48-second 40-yard dash) he more than makes up for with physicality and toughness. And he's far from a middling athlete, posting a 42-inch vertical jump and an 11-foot, 3-inch broad jump that both rank in the 97th percentile at the position in the MockDraftable database.\n\nWith two years of starting experience playing both inside and outside, the strength and mentality to defend the run and the tools to grow into a lockdown press defender, the 22-year-old Phillips brings an intriguing package to a cornerback room that needs to bolster its depth behind Humphrey and Stephens.\n\nAlso considered: Alabama EDGE Chris Braswell, Connecticut G Christian Haynes, Central Florida WR Javon Baker\n\nNo. 93 (Round 3): Southern California WR Brenden Rice\n\nYes, he's from that Rice family. Brenden is the youngest son of Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, but those bloodlines are not the only reason to be excited about his potential.\n\nThe 6-2, 208-pound Colorado transfer was a two-year starter at outside receiver for the Trojans and became one of star quarterback Caleb Williams' favorite targets, catching a team-leading 12 touchdown passes this past season.\n\nWhile Rice isn't an outstanding separator downfield, his size, feel for the game, long arms (33 inches, 79th percentile among wideouts per MockDraftable) and strong hands offer starting potential for a team that needs a true outside receiver -- especially if Bateman doesn't return next year.\n\nAlso considered: Washington EDGE Bralen Trice, Kansas State G Cooper Beebe, Texas Tech S Dadrion Taylor-Demerson\n\nNo. 113 (Round 4): Notre Dame RB Audric Estim\u00e9\n\nThe fourth round feels like the sweet spot for the Ravens to find their running back of the future.\n\nWith Henry, Hill and Mitchell leading the way, there isn't a clear path for a rookie to get many touches this year or next. But Estim\u00e9 has a tantalizing package of size, athleticism and experience that could push him onto the field.\n\nAt 5-11 and 221 pounds (and only 20 years old), Estim\u00e9 might be the hammer the Ravens need to keep Henry fresh and wear down opposing defenses late in the game. He averaged an incredible 6.39 yards on 210 carries last season, using his imposing physique (reportedly 7% body fat), agility and balance to churn through defenders. A whopping 892 of his 1,341 yards came after contact, according to PFF, and he forced 64 missed tackles.\n\nWhile his lack of long speed (4.71-second 40-yard dash) might limit him to being a short-yardage grinder like Gus Edwards, that's still a valuable role for an offense that runs the ball as much as the Ravens do.\n\nAlso considered: Texas DT T'Vondre Sweat, Penn State C/G Hunter Nourzad, Pittsburgh OT Matt Goncalves\n\nNo. 130 (Round 4): Wake Forest S Malik Mustapha\n\nAfter saying goodbye to breakout star Stone, the Ravens are left with no depth behind starting safeties Kyle Hamilton and Marcus Williams. And given how important Stone was when Williams was injured last season, finding a third safety is a must.\n\nWhile undersized at 5-10 and 209 pounds, Mustapha is well-built, reportedly adding 25 pounds of muscle during his time in college. What sets him apart is his ability to fly downhill in run support and cover ground quickly. The Richmond transfer models his game after Arizona Cardinals star Budda Baker and lined up all over the field, including in a hybrid \"Panther\" position on third downs that ranged from covering the slot to blitzing off the edge.\n\nMustapha might be best served taking on a special teams role as a rookie, but he has the athleticism, versatility and mentality to grow into a dependable part of the secondary.\n\nAlso considered: Temple LB Jordan Magee, LSU DT Mekhi Wingo, Colorado State EDGE Mohamed Kamara\n\nNo. 165 (Round 5): Michigan EDGE Braiden McGregor\n\nThe Ravens still have high hopes for Oweh and Ojabo, but the return of veteran Kyle Van Noy suggests they're not satisfied with their group of edge defenders.\n\nThe 6-5, 257-pound McGregor's production and athletic profile are not very inspiring, but there's a strong case to be made that his best football is ahead of him. The top recruit in Michigan's 2020 class improved over the past three seasons and saved his best for last, recording 3 1/2 sacks over his final five games.\n\nWith just 697 career defensive snaps, the former hockey, basketball and lacrosse player is still raw in terms of technique and might already be maxed out as an athlete, but his first-step quickness and relentless attitude could help him earn playing time. The Athletic's Dane Brugler said he often wrote \"fast\" and \"violent\" in his notes while watching McGregor's tape, and those traits would be a welcome addition to the Ravens' group of pass rushers.\n\nAlso considered: Michigan G Zak Zinter, Tennessee CB Kamal Hadden, Oregon State WR Anthony Gould\n\nNo. 218 (Round 6): Northern Iowa DT Khristian Boyd\n\nThe Ravens reportedly brought in Boyd for a top-30 visit, so there's a chance we might see this match in the real draft.\n\nThe 6-2, 329-pound Football Championship Subdivision star stood out during the East-West Shrine Bowl, showing off a strong bull rush that proved difficult for offensive linemen to stop. After posting 10 1/2 sacks and 22 1/2 tackles for loss in six college seasons, the surprising combine snub finished with a school-record 38 bench-press reps at his pro day.\n\nBoyd is already 24 years old and didn't face top competition during his college career, but he can be a reliable run defender with the potential to grow into a better pass rusher.\n\nAlso considered: Mississippi State DT Jaden Crumedy, Utah OT Sataoa Laumea, Tennessee QB Joe Milton III\n\nMark Andrews is a star, Isaiah Likely is quickly becoming one and Charlie Kolar has the potential to be a productive player, but none of them are going to earn much praise for their blocking. There's no guarantee McLachlan will ever become an outstanding blocker, either, but his effort and competitiveness suggest there's a chance.\n\nThe 6-5, 244-pound McLachlan is also no slouch when it comes to catching the ball. The Southern Utah transfer's 79 career receptions in two seasons at Arizona broke Rob Gronkowski's school record for a tight end, and he did plenty of damage after the catch, too, including some hurdles.\n\nHe'd face a steep climb to not only make the roster but earn playing time behind the Ravens' top tight ends, but McLachlan could carve out a role for himself because of what NFL.com scout Lance Zierlein described as a \"whatever it takes\" mentality.\n\nAlso considered: NC State C Dylan McMahon, Maryland CB Tarheeb Still, Pittsburgh WR Bub Means\n\nNo. 250 (Round 7): Wyoming OT Frank Crum\n\nWe're in dart-throw territory at the end of the draft, but that doesn't mean you can't find a quality player.\n\nThe 6-8, 313-pound Crum, a third-generation Wyoming player, was a full-time starter for four seasons with the Cowboys and has experience at both tackle spots. He earned the nickname \"Frank the Tank\" for his prowess as a run blocker, and that showed up at the combine when he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.94 seconds, third-best among offensive linemen. He also posted a vertical jump of 31 1/2 inches (85th percentile, per MockDraftable) and a 9-foot, 6-inch broad jump (93rd percentile), showing off his explosiveness.\n\nUltimately, Crum has work to do to hold up as a pass protector at the next level, but his athletic profile is worth betting on as the Ravens seek a long-term solution at tackle.\n\nAlso considered: Penn State CB Daequan Hardy, Charlotte EDGE Eyabi Okie-Anoma, Mississippi State LB Nathaniel Watson", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_wacker@capitalgazette.com", "name": "Brian Wacker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "c_j_doon@capitalgazette.com", "name": "C.J.

He appeared poised for a breakout 2022 campaign when he registered 226 receiving yards and two touchdowns over the first three games, but he sustained a Week 4 foot injury that led to season-ending surgery. Last year, observers questioned Bateman's on-field chemistry with MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson as the two misfired on numerous big-play opportunities. Baltimore is betting on a full spring and summer on the practice field to remedy that, especially with veteran wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. no longer on the roster.\n\nThe move also adds some long-term stability to the position group as 2023 first-round pick Zay Flowers had been Baltimore's only wide receiver under contract beyond the upcoming season.\n\nIn 34 career games, Bateman has caught 93 passes for 1,167 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nThe Ravens are looking for offensive linemen in the NFL draft, but their philosophy should change. Instead of looking for the dominant, physical maulers up front, they should seek versatile performers who can balance run and pass blocking.\n\nIn recent seasons, the Ravens have been one of the best -- if not the best -- in the NFL at running the ball, but they can't get to the Super Bowl because of their inability to protect quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nIt hasn't mattered who has lined up under center, the results have been the same. In the gut-wrenching wild-card playoff loss to the Cincinnati Bengals two seasons ago, backup Tyler Huntley was sacked twice and hit five times.\n\nIn the 17-10 AFC championship game loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs, Jackson was sacked four times in a game that was reminiscent of the 23-17 wild-card-round loss to the Los Angeles Chargers after his breakthrough 2018 rookie season.\n\nThe Ravens should stress more versatility with their offensive linemen and draft players who can do more than maul people in the running game. There are several holes to fill, including both guard spots and right tackle. This draft presents them with several opportunities to find a starter, or more than one.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the Ravens do in the first round. According to some draft experts, there could be as many as 10 offensive tackles taken in the first round.\n\nAfter a tackle, the Ravens might target a guard, such as Kansas State's Cooper Beebe or Connecticut's Christian Haynes, in the second round. Regardless, though, the Ravens need to get out of that old-school mindset when it comes to evaluating offensive linemen.\n\nBALTIMORE RAVENS: TRADE UP FOR AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IN ROUNDS 1 OR 2\n\nAfter trading away Morgan Moses, the third-highest-graded right tackle in the NFL last season, and restructuring left tackle Ronnie Stanley's contract, the Ravens are facing 2024 and 2025 needs at both tackle spots. Picking 30th overall, they may need to move up in the first round if they want to grab any of the six offensive tackles in the top 20 of PFF's big board. If Baltimore waits until Round 2, acquiring developmental players like Yale's Kiran Amegadjie or BYU's Kingsley Suamataia could require a trade-up from No. 62.\n\n30. Baltimore Ravens\n\nJamison Hensley's pick: Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens could consider trading out of the first round if a team wants to move up to get a quarterback, but, if Mims is available, Baltimore will be ecstatic to make the pick. The Ravens fill their biggest need with Mims, who didn't allow a sack at Georgia. Mims will start immediately at right tackle. Adding a big-bodied blocker for reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson would be a best-case scenario for the Ravens.\n\n30. Baltimore Ravens: Tyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma\n\nGuyton only started 15 games in college, so he has plenty still to learn. However, the Ravens traditionally do a nice job developing linemen. With Guyton, there's so much to work with. He's a well-proportioned 6-foot-7, 322-pounder who has long arms, strong hands and tremendous athleticism for a big man. The Ravens, who need a young and talented offensive tackle after trading Morgan Moses last month, will happily deal with Guyton's inevitable growing pains. It was tempting to take Alabama cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry -- and don't be surprised if Baltimore does just that -- but it was too hard to pass up a plug-and-play right tackle with Guyton's upside.\n\nBrandon Coleman\n\nTCU \u00b7 OG \u00b7 23 years old\n\nDJ's Big Board Ranking: No. 99\n\nProduction Score: 64\n\nAthleticism Score: 97\n\nOVERALL DRAFT SCORE: 79\n\nColeman has a reasonable chance to hear his name called toward the end of Day 2, as the No. 99-ranked prospect on Jeremiah's list. Nevertheless, in this exercise, Coleman is our top Day 3 sleeper after posting the highest NGS athleticism score (97) among offensive guards at the combine.\n\nA former JUCO transfer, Coleman gained experience at both tackle and guard over 34 career starts at TCU. At 6-4 1/2, 313 pounds with 34 5/8-inch arms and an 84-inch wingspan, Coleman possesses the size and length expected of an NFL offensive lineman, offering invaluable positional flexibility at four of the five spots along the front.\n\nAt the combine, it was his 40 speed (4.99 seconds), 34-inch vertical leap and 9-foot-6 broad jump that helped Coleman earn a blue-chip athleticism score from the NGS model. Coleman reached a top speed of 20.35 mph during his 40, the second-fastest top speed among interior offensive linemen, slower than only the next player on our list ...", "source": {"uri":

He was better than that, even with the injury. He's been a starter since Day 1. He was better than [teammate] Terrion Arnold most of his career ... Kool-Aid at the end of the first round, that's a heck of a pick there in terms of where they were, where they are now in terms of value.\n\nBALTIMORE RAVENS MAKE A BIG JUMP FOR AN OFFENSIVE TACKLE\n\nThe Ravens traded away starter Morgan Moses, whose 80.4 PFF grade in 2023 was the third highest among right tackles. They also restructured left tackle Ronnie Stanley's contract this offseason after he ranked 18th among left tackles with a 75.9 PFF pass-blocking grade in 2023. He is now set to become a free agent after 2024. That gives the Ravens both short- and longer-term needs at tackle.\n\nBaltimore picks at No. 30 overall and could draft a falling tackle, with players like Oklahoma's Tyler Guyton and Arizona's Jordan Morgan frequently being linked to the Ravens in mock drafts. I like the idea of Baltimore being aggressive, especially if a player like Washington's Troy Fautanu or Penn State's Olu Fashanu reaches the midpoint of the first round. The Ravens would likely need to add a second- and a fourth-round pick to get up into that range, but given their needs at the position this year and next, it's a move that could set them up for the next five years at left tackle.\n\nWhy He Makes Sense:\n\nMitchell was productive both outside and in the slot for the Longhorns and would add a versatile target to Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken's scheme. At 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, Mitchell has a strong skillset working the middle of the field and catching balls in traffic. He also has the speed (ran the 40-yard dash in 4.34 seconds) to take the top off a defense. Mitchell could join Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely to give Jackson another big body target to work with.\n\n\"Mitchell has outstanding size, toughness and polish for the position. He has surprisingly good route polish for a bigger receiver. He understands how to change tempo, and he's clean getting in and out of breaks. He gave Kool-Aid McKinstry a lot of trouble in the Alabama game last September, finishing with three catches for 78 yards and two TDs. He has some wow catches on fades and 50/50 balls. It looks like he gets a little lazy at times on the back side of routes, assuming the ball is going elsewhere. He doesn't have a ton of production after the catch. Overall, though, Mitchell is an ideal X receiver. He can make plays when covered, and he's a real weapon in the red zone.\" - Daniel Jeremiah, NFL Network\n\nTroy Franklin, WR, Oregon\n\nPop on an Oregon tape and you will see Franklin running away from defenders. He is a long strider who has impressive speed, clocking at 4.4 in the 40 at the combine. There were also a lot of plays where he was behind the defensive back, but had to wait for the football. The flip side is he did have some drops. He needs to improve his catching of the football. He struggled with it at the combine workout, but was much better at his pro day. He showed last season he could take a slant, split the defense and take it to the house. There aren't a lot of guys who can do that, running away from defensive backs. He can, which is why he should be a late first-round pick in my book but will likely go in the second.\n\nT.J. Tampa, CB, Iowa State\n\nHe is a long corner at 6-1, but he isn't a burner after being timed at 4.53 at his pro day. He is the type of corner who would fit in with a team that runs a lot of zone -- which he played a lot of in college. He is smart and athletic enough to be a good zone corner who can improve his man techniques enough on the next level. He will throw his body around in the run game, almost getting too overaggressive at times but he isn't a great tackler because of the misses. He had two picks last season. I could also see him moving inside to safety and holding up well there on the next level because he is aggressive, and a team wants that.", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com", "dataType":

We see a lot of different opportunities in different rounds to get players at tackle, guard and center, and we're excited about that.\"\n\nDeCosta noted that a wide receiver could be selected with one of their nine draft picks.\n\nThe Ravens have a pick in the first, second and third; two in the fourth and seventh rounds; and one in the fifth and sixth rounds.\n\nThey drafted Zay Flowers with the 22nd overall pick in 2023, and he led the team with 858 receiving yards. Nelson Agholor re-signed and Rashod Bateman agreed to an extension.\n\nBut, it is unlikely that free agent Odell Beckham Jr. will return to Baltimore.\n\nThe Ravens could have a shot at George's Ladd McConkey, Texas's Xavier Worthy or Florida State's Keon Coleman.\n\n\"I think receiver is a really deep draft this year,\" DeCosta said.\n\nThe Ravens addressed their running back position, adding Pro Bowler Derrick Henry in the backfield with quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nStill, if a running back is available, the Ravens could have eyes on players like Michigan's Blake Corum, who played at Baltimore's St. Frances Academy, USC's MarShawn Lloyd or Wisconsin's Braelyn Allen.\n\n\"I think that you'll see a lot of running backs get drafted, probably, starting in the third round through the seventh,\" DeCosta said.\n\nDefensively, the Ravens could use depth at cornerback.\n\nTheir safeties are set with Kyle Hamilton and Marcus Williams, despite losing Geno Stone, who had seven interceptions last year.\n\nBut, cornerback Marlon Humphrey missed seven regular-season games and a playoff game because of injury.\n\nSome of the available defensive backs for the Ravens could be Iowa's Cooper DeJean, Alabama's Kool-Aid McKinstry, Clemson's Nate Wiggins and Missouri's Ennis Rakestraw Jr.\n\nWhile the Ravens' extended pass rusher Justin Madubuike, who led the team in sacks, they lost Jadeveon Clowney.\n\nThey also lost linebacker Patrick Queen, but have star Roquan Smith quarterbacking that defense.\n\nThe Ravens could have a shot at grabbing a solid pass rusher like Penn State's Chop Robinson, Missouri's Darius Robinson, Western Michigan's Marshawn Kneeland or Baltimore's own Chris Braswell, from Alabama.\n\n\"We'll have some opportunities, for sure,\" DeCosta said. \"There are going to be some spots that can be filled, and I think the burden is on me to find those players who can fill it, and fill it with winning football, and we've got the coaches and support staff to put them in position to succeed.\"\n\nThe NFL Draft starts with the first round on Thursday.

The team has a pick in each round but an additional pick in Round 4 & 7.\n\nEach year, teams are always looking to trade up and down, and the Ravens shouldn't be immune from that. Baltimore has made a trade during the draft in every year of DeCosta's tenure, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see them make some moves this weekend.

Instead, the Ravens tied the Minnesota Vikings by having the most players lost this offseason: 15. These losses created some big holes in the Ravens' starting lineup.\n\nSome player exists were addressed in Free Agency. While DE Jadeveon Clowney signed a $20 million contract with the Panthers, they signed edge rusher Kyle Van Noy. Similarly, while the Ravens lost RB Gus Edwards to the Chargers, they signed RB Derrick Henry.\n\nThe Ravens' biggest losses that have not been addressed are three starters on the offensive line, right tackle Morgan Moses was traded to the New York Jets and guards Kevin Zeitler and John Simpson signed elsewhere. Additionally, our old friend Ronald Darby signed with the Jaguars, creating an opening at one CB spot.\n\nWith the Ravens traditionally being a run first team and Lamar Jackson's health being essential to their success, one struggles to fathom given the loss of three offensive linemen that their first pick will be anything other than a big body to make holes for Derrick Henry and keep Jackson upright.\n\nFurthermore, with Kool-Aid McKinstry just being picked by the Lions, the next CB on most boards would be a bit of a reach here.\n\nThis offensive line draft class has good news and bad news for the Ravens. While the Ravens have some OT options on the roster, including Daniel Faalele and Patrick Mekari on this year's squad and the free agent addition of Josh Jones, options to replace the departed guards appear limited. With the solid need for an interior lineman and drafting 30th, where the premier offensive tackles have already been drafted but to where a stud interior lineman may fall, one might project an interior lineman to the Ravens. In that bad news for the Ravens, only Jackson Powers-Johnson, who the Eagles drafted in this mock, has a first-round grade. The only possible consideration might be Zach Frazier, the Center from West Virginia.\n\nNow the good news for the Ravens is that draft analysts see as many as 8 offensive tackles having first round grades. The two best available options are Tyler Guyton from Oklahoma and Jordan Morgan from Arizona.\n\nHere's a contrast provided by the AI search engine Perplexity:\n\nGuyton is a massive, 6'8\" 328-pound tackle who displays impressive athleticism and power for his size. He is an excellent pass protector, with the length and footwork to neutralize speed rushers. Guyton's size and explosiveness also make him an effective run blocker who can overwhelm defenders at the point of attack. However, he is inconsistent at times and needs to play with more physicality and aggression. There are also some concerns about his maturity and character that could impact his draft stock.\n\nIn contrast, the 6'5\" 312-pound Jordan Morgan is more of a technician at offensive tackle. He has refined pass blocking technique, sound footwork, and the ability to mirror edge rushers. Morgan is also praised for his effort, intelligence, and versatility to potentially play guard or tackle. The main concerns with Morgan are his shorter than ideal arm length, which can limit him in the run game, and his average overall strength compared to elite NFL tackles.\n\nThe Ravens with their experienced coaching staff and strong player culture, feel they can mitigate any maturity and character issues, so lean into the better athlete with more upside by selecting Tyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma. With Ronnie Stanley installed as the left tackle and free agent Josh Jones available as a LT backup should Stanley frequent injury history continue, the Ravens are also attracted to Guyton's experience on the right side.\n\nMockdraftable's spider chart and measurements gives you a feel for Guyton's huge size and athleticism:\n\nHere's a Tyler Guyton draft analysis video including clips of him on the field:\n\nThe Ravens feel fortunate to grab a prospect with this high level of talent and athleticism who fits a need this late in the first round!\n\nNow it's time for you to vote for who YOU think should be selected in the 2024 BGN Community Consensus Mock Draft.", "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

You have likely seen the very awkward promos that pair Detroiter and Rap Superstar Eminem with Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nHopefully for the Baltimore Ravens, their first round pick, at #30, turns out a lot better than those series of advertisements did. The Ravens have a very rich history when it comes to getting it right on draft night, and we're revisiting it here.\n\n1996- Putting Your Best Foot Forward\n\nTalking about \"leading with strength!\" The very first draft pick in Ravens history was made here at #4, in the form of Jonathan Ogden, OT, UCLA. He went on to be enshrined in Canton, and was named the 72nd greatest player in NFL history by NFL Network in 2010. The Ravens then drafted Ray Lewis at #26 out of Miami, and he also made the Hall of Fame.\n\nLewis is #18 on that aforementioned NFL 100 list, with only two linebackers (Lawrence Taylor #3 and Dick Butkus #10) ranking higher.\n\n2011- Time Runs Out\n\nIt's very rare, but it does happen- sometimes the team \"on the clock\" sees its time expire before making their pick. The Ravens had been working on a trade, but it didn't materialize in time to make the pick and their 26th overall instead went to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAt least the Ravens made their selection almost immediately after, now 27th on the board, in the form of Colorado cornerback Jimmy Smith. The Minnesota Vikings made this same mistake in 2003. Both of these purple clad franchises can forever relate to the timeless lyrics of Culture Club: \"Oh, in time, it could have been so much more. The time is precious I know.\"\n\n2018- The Franchise\n\nWhen most face of the franchise, superstar quarterbacks get drafted, it's at or near the top of the first round. Baltimore nabbed Lamar Jackson at #32 out of Louisville, the very last pick in the first round. When you draft a two time MVP winner at this selection slot, it's pretty safe to call it \"a steal.\" Four other QBs were taken ahead of Jackson that night.\n\n2008- Super Bowl Building Block\n\nOn this draft night, the Ravens took a gamble on a FCS level prospect, selecting Delaware QB Joe Flacco with the 18th overall pick. He would go on to lead the Ravens to six playoff appearances, three AFC Championship Game appearances and the Super Bowl XLVII title; where he was named the game's MVP.\n\n2022- Greatest Safety Ever?\n\nOn this draft night, the Ravens landed Ed Reed at #24 out of Miami. Reed made the Pro Bowl nine times during his legendary career, and among his many accolades is the career record for interception return yardage (1,590), most career postseason interceptions (9), most seasons leading the league in interceptions (3) and the longest ever interception return for a touchdown (107 yards). Reed is #88 on the all-time NFL top 100 list.", "source": {"uri": "ravenswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ravens Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Last year, with no second-round pick and only six picks total, general manager Eric DeCosta went looking for bets that might pay off in 2024 or 2025. Going into this year, DeCosta has made it plain that he sees the next two pick-rich drafts as major opportunities to restock his roster depth.\n\nAs we guess how DeCosta might go about that mission, it's useful to look at his recent past as a drafter. Which picks did he nail? Where were his blind spots? Did the Ravens get what they needed out of each draft? With that in mind, let's review every one of the team's picks and every one of its drafts as a whole going back to 2021.\n\nRashod Bateman (Round 1, pick 27)\n\nBateman was a durable, productive pass catcher at Minnesota, praised for his attention to detail as a route runner and capable of busting free downfield. He was expected to fit seamlessly with Marquise Brown to give Lamar Jackson an exciting set of young targets. Over three seasons, we have seen all the talent that put Bateman in this spot, but his rookie totals of 46 catches and 515 yards remain career highs, in part because of terrible injury luck and in part because his chemistry with Jackson has yet to click consistently. Data showed Bateman routinely separating from defensive backs last season, but he did not see increased targets and finished with just one touchdown catch. DeCosta and coach John Harbaugh have said they expect a major leap from Bateman this season, and the Ravens backed up those statements by signing him to an extension through 2026. Grade: C\n\nOdafe Oweh (Round 1, pick 31)\n\nWith a pick they obtained by trading starting right tackle Orlando Brown Jr., the Ravens took one of the draft's most spectacular physical talents. The two numbers everyone knew about Oweh? Zero sacks in his final season at Penn State and the 4.36-second 40-yard dash he ran at 6 feet 5 and 257 pounds. In reality, he has been neither boom nor bust over three seasons in Baltimore. The Ravens probably hoped for more than 13 sacks in 45 games, but Oweh's underlying pressure numbers are better than that, and last season was his best. He's a candidate to break out, much as his pal, Justin Madubuike, did in 2023. The Ravens face a vexing decision on his fifth-year option. Grade: B-\n\nBen Cleveland (Round 3, pick 94)\n\nHarbaugh gushed about this pick, believing the Ravens had obtained a perfect inside mauler to clear space for their runners. Cleveland has struggled to get on the field, however, because of injuries, lackluster conditioning and subpar mobility. To his credit, he has held up fairly well when called to duty, and he will have a real chance to start at guard in the last season of his rookie deal. Grade: C-\n\nBrandon Stephens (Round 3, pick 104)\n\nStephens' versatility and pugnacious style made him an intriguing developmental prospect for the secondary, but the converted running back was an obscurity to many draft watchers. Stephens blossomed in his third season, erasing fears over the team's lack of secondary depth by seizing a starting cornerback job and delivering above-average performance. He will enter 2024 as a starter at a premium position with a chance to earn a tasty deal next offseason. Grade: A-\n\nTylan Wallace (Round 4, pick 131)\n\nPundits and fans loved Wallace as a potential value play at wide receiver coming off a productive career at Oklahoma State. He didn't play much his first two seasons but fought his way off the roster bubble last summer and made one of the most exciting plays of 2023 with his walk-off punt return against the Los Angeles Rams. Grade: C+\n\nShaun Wade (Round 5, pick 160)\n\nOnce regarded as a potential first-round pick based on his decorated career at Ohio State, Wade never made a push for snaps with the Ravens, who traded him for a pair of late-round picks at the end of his rookie summer. Grade: D\n\nDaelin Hayes (Round 5, pick 171)\n\nThe odds of finding a starting edge rusher in the fifth round are minuscule, but Hayes arrived with a nifty set of moves and flashed in summer workouts. He could never translate that performance to training camp, and injuries derailed his development. Grade: D\n\nBen Mason (Round 5, pick 184)\n\nThe Ravens steered into their image by drafting a fullback who played for Harbaugh's brother at Michigan. Mason showed good hands in training camp and hung around the team's practice squad but never threatened to displace Pat Ricard. Grade: C-\n\nOverall: The Ravens' top needs coming off a season that ended in the AFC divisional round of the playoffs were a dynamic wide receiver, a productive edge rusher and blockers who could keep Jackson upright against a playoff-quality defense. DeCosta went right at those holes with his first three picks, but the results have been uneven at best. His second third-round pick, Stephens, prompted the most chin-scratching on draft day but returned the best value last season. The Ravens got no game day production from Wade, Hayes or Mason. If neither Bateman nor Oweh breaks out, this could go down as DeCosta's weakest draft. Grade: C\n\nKyle Hamilton (Round 1, pick 14)\n\nSome questioned the Ravens using such a high pick on a safety when they already had two starters at the position and when Hamilton's exact fit was unclear. What we've learned over two seasons is that Hamilton fits anywhere because he can do almost anything, from covering tight ends to dropping running backs to rushing off the edge. He might be the best safety in the league and the most important player on the Ravens' defense. Grade: A+\n\nTyler Linderbaum (Round 1, pick 25)\n\nSome second guessers wondered why the Ravens would use the payoff for trading Marquise Brown on a center. But Linderbaum has been exactly as advertised, starting since the minute he showed up, making the Pro Bowl in his second season and giving the Ravens a building block for their offensive line. Grade: A\n\nDavid Ojabo (Round 2, pick 45)\n\nThis was the Ravens' big value play as they stashed an edge rusher who would have gone in the first round had he not torn his Achilles tendon during his pro day at Michigan. The hope was that Ojabo would bust out in his second season, but knee surgery shut him down again, and he's back to the drawing board as he prepares for another shot in 2024. There's still time for DeCosta's risk to pay off. Grade: C-\n\nTravis Jones (Round 3, pick 76)\n\nThe Ravens have always loved using mid-round picks to accumulate future starters for their defensive interior, and the 6-4, 338-pound Jones is on track after he took a step forward in 2023. He's still projected to share time with Michael Pierce but has the talent to become a more frequent playmaker. Grade: B\n\nDaniel Faalele (Round 4, pick 110)\n\nThe biggest player in the draft wasn't ready when thrust into an emergency start at tackle as a rookie. The Ravens liked Faalele's progress going into Year 2, and he helped them by rotating in for a hurting Morgan Moses late in the season. Will he have a real chance to start in 2024, or will the Ravens fill Moses' shoes in this draft? Grade: B-\n\nJalyn Armour-Davis (Round 4, pick 119)\n\nArmour-Davis had the speed to be another first-round cornerback out of Alabama but could not stay on the field consistently. That has been the story of his NFL career as well, and he might be running low on chances. Grade: C-\n\nCharlie Kolar (Round 4, pick 128)\n\nThe Ravens saw Kolar as a possession target who could relieve Mark Andrews. Then, they hoped he might add strength and polish his blocking to fit an in-line role. He has yet to find his niche and could be on the roster bubble going into training camp. Grade: C-\n\nJordan Stout (Round 4, pick 130)\n\nStout's big leg and all-around athleticism made him the Ravens' choice to succeed franchise institution Sam Koch at punter. He's locked in as the team's starter but still searching for the consistency, especially on more tactically delicate punts, that set Koch apart. Grade: B\n\nIsaiah Likely (Round 4, pick 139)\n\nLikely flashed star potential as a pass catcher from the moment he stepped on the practice field in the summer of 2022 and was a major reason why the Ravens thrived in Andrews' absence last year. The trick now will be to get him and Andrews producing at the same time. Either way, Likely is integral to the Ravens' plans for giving Jackson a dynamic set of targets. Grade: A-\n\nDamarion Williams (Round 4, pick 141)\n\nWilliams has potential as an option to cover slot receivers, but injuries wiped out his opportunity to show it in 2023. Grade: C\n\nTyler Badie (Round 6, pick 196)\n\nBadie couldn't find an opportunity with the Ravens, and the Denver Broncos signed the running back off their practice squad in December 2022. Grade: C-\n\nOverall: DeCosta took an unusual approach, steering away from premium positions with his first two picks, but it's hard to argue with any draft that yields a pair of Pro Bowl selections in the first round. The gamble on Ojabo has yet to pay off, and the six fourth-round picks are a mixed bag, as one might expect. Jones and especially Likely could provide outstanding value. Grade: A\n\nZay Flowers (Round 1, pick 22)\n\nDeCosta used his first pick on a wide receiver for the third time in five years, and Flowers proved to be a good one, leading the Ravens in catches and receiving yards as a rookie. He also produced in the playoffs, though his goal line fumble was a key negative play in the Ravens' AFC championship game loss. The Ravens are still figuring out how to use Flowers, who was frequently bottled up when Jackson targeted him with quick outside throws. But he's the team's No. 1 receiver going into 2024. Grade: A-\n\nTrenton Simpson (Round 3, pick 86)\n\nThe Ravens didn't have a second-round pick because they traded it for Pro Bowl linebacker Roquan Smith. In the third round, they chose a potential future partner for Smith in the speedy Simpson. With Patrick Queen on the field for almost every defensive snap in 2023, Simpson didn't play much, but he excelled in the regular-season finale and will be the top candidate to fill Queen's shoes this year. Grade: B\n\nTavius Robinson (Round 4, pick 124)\n\nRobinson was the steadiest contributor from the class other than Queen. The 6-foot-6, 258-pound outside linebacker didn't flash much as a pass rusher but was sturdy enough as an edge-setter that the Ravens gave him defensive snaps in every regular-season game. Grade: B-\n\nKyu Blu Kelly (Round 5, pick 157)\n\nEven when injuries struck their secondary during training camp, the Ravens never seemed to see Kelly as a viable option to step in at cornerback. They waived him at the end of training camp, and he bounced to three other teams by the end of the season. Grade: D\n\nMalaesala Aumavae-Laulu (Round 6, pick 199)\n\nThe Ravens treated the 6-5, 325-pound Aumavae-Laulu as a potential starting guard going into training camp, but he quickly fell behind in that competition and was regularly inactive on game days once the season started. He's rarely mentioned as a candidate to fill one of the three open starter jobs on the Ravens' offensive line, a sign of how raw he proved to be. Grade: C+\n\nAndrew Vorhees (Round 7, pick 229)\n\nDeCosta pulled a nifty move, jumping back into the last round to add an experienced, powerful offensive lineman who would have been picked several rounds higher if he was healthy. Vorhees is back from that torn ACL and is expected to compete for snaps at guard this summer. Teams don't find many starters in the last round, so the upside here is significant. Grade: B\n\nOverall: This is the most difficult draft to grade because two of the key picks, Simpson and Vorhees, could jump into significant roles this year. If both of them join Flowers in the starting lineup, that would be a great payoff for six total picks, but we can't say for sure.

I took into account need, value, fit and reported pre-draft interest when making each selection.\n\nNo. 30 overall -- Kool-Aid McKinstry, CB, Alabama\n\nAlthough it wouldn't be surprising to see the Ravens move up or stick and pick an offensive tackle with their first pick, cornerback is their second biggest need. The former Crimson Tide standout might very well be the best player available at this point on opening night and after not spending a top 100 pick at the position since selecting Marlon Humphrey at No. 16 overall in 2017 from the same program, this could be where DeCosta ends the streak. McKinstry comes with great pedigree, instincts and anticipation and experience having been a full-time starter since he was a true freshman which is rare for a Nick Saban defense. The Ravens believe in rotating their top three corners regardless of health status so he could see some regular time as a rookie even if he doesn't make a single start. During his college career, he only recorded two interceptions but those low figures were more of a reflection of how much opposing teams respected him than a lack of ball skills because he still broke up 23 passes including a career-high 15 in 2022.\n\nNo. 48 overall via trade with Jacksonville Jaguars -- OT Kingsley Suamataia, OT, BYU\n\nAfter bypassing the offensive tackle position in the first round, the Ravens send a 2025 third and a 2026 fourth to trade up ahead of the Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers to take their left tackle of the future and potential starting right tackle of the present. The former Cougar is one of the most athletically gifted linemen in this year's draft with All-Pro potential and elite measurables at 6-foot-8 and 326 pounds with 34.25-inch arms. Suamataia is a former five-star recruit who transferred from Oregon after appearing in just one game as a serve at left tackle and was a two-year starter at BYU, starting 12 games on the right side in 2022 and 11 games on the left last season. Having just turned 21 years old in January, he is still just scratching the surface of his full potential and paired with Ravens' renowned offensive line coach Joe D'Alessandris, he can realize it in Baltimore.\n\nNo. 93 overall -- Javon Baker, WR, UCF\n\nDue to the incredible depth of this year's class at the wide receiver position, the Ravens get a steal of a pick in the later part of Day 2 with the former Knight. Baker can add an element to the Ravens wideout corps they currently don't have a specialist in as a dangerous vertical threat with contested catch ability both of which he has in spades. Once he transferred from Alabama to UCF, his college career took off as he got an expanded opportunity to show what he was capable of. He was the Knights leading receiver the past two years and is coming off a senior season in which he recorded career highs with 1,139 receiving yards, seven touchdowns and 21.9 yards per reception which was the second-most in the nation. Baker attended the 2024 Reese's Senior Bowl where he was one of the brightest standouts and was one of the prospects the Ravens brought in for one of their top 30 pre-draft visits.\n\nNo. 113 overall -- Mohamed Kamara, EDGE, Colorado State\n\nThe Ravens land yet another potential mid-round gem at outside linebacker with the former Ram who was a highly productive and consistently impactful edge presence in college. Kamara is a bit undersized at 6-foot-1 and 248 pounds with 32-inch arms but he is very athletic and uses his lack of ideal measurables to gain a leverage advantage when rushing the passer or setting the edge against the run. He was a standout at the 2024 East-West Shrine Bowl and tested very well at the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine, running a 4.57 in the 40-yard dash, leaping 10-foot-3 in the broad jump, and recording 23 reps on the bench press. Kamara racked up 29.5 sacks, 45.5 tackles for loss and five forced fumbles during his collegiate career including a career-high 13 sacks and 17 tackles for loss in 2023 on his way to earning Mountain West Conference Defensive Player of the Year honors.\n\nNo. 130 overall -- Mason McCormick, OG, South Dakota State\n\nThe Ravens pick up their second offensive lineman of the draft and add another stud to the competition for one of the starting guard spots with the former Jackrabbit. McCormick is one of the best small school prospects in this year's draft who was a four-year starter in college which included making 57 straight to close out his career for the two-time defending FCS national champions. He proved he could dominate high-level competition at the 2024 East-West Shrine Bowl and tested well at the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine. Don't be surprised if the Ravens try to target him a little earlier, fearing he might not last until the late fourth.\n\nNo. 165 overall -- Blake Watson, RB, Memphis\n\nThe Ravens round out their backfield with one of the most underrated and dynamic running back prospects in this year's draft. The former Tiger is a converted receiver who brings a lot of upside as a pass catcher both out of the backfield or lined up in the lot against linebackers and safeties. His skill set is one the offense doesn't currently have at the position to the degree he can be utilized. Despite being one of the brightest standouts at the 2024 East-West Shrine Bowl, Watson wasn't invited to this year's NFL Scouting Combine but he still wound up testing extremely well at his Pro Day, running 4.39 in the 40-yard dash and jumped 41.5 inches in the vertical leap and 11-foot-3 in the broad jump. In his final collegiate season, he recorded over 1,600 yards from scrimmage including a career-high 1,152 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns and added another 480 receiving yards and three scores on 53 receptions.\n\nNo. 218 overall -- Edefuan Ulofoshio, LB, Washington\n\nWhile the Ravens re-signed Malik Harrison and brought back Chris Board, both are on one-year deals. The former Huskie is the prototypical late-round flier the team typically targets on Day 3 whether it's in the final rounds or as a priority undrafted free agent. Ulofoshio was a team captain for the 2023 NCAA national title runner-ups who walked on, worked his way up the depth chart by competing on special teams and eventually earned a starting role on defense. He also attended the Senior Bowl where he was a standout during both the week of practice and the game then boosted his draft stock further by testing extremely well at the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine. In his final collegiate season, he recorded career-highs across the board with 94 total tackles including eight for a loss, three sacks, three pass breakups, a forced fumble and an interception he returned 45 yards for a touchdown.\n\nNo. 228 overall -- Trey Taylor, DB, Air Force\n\nThe free agency departure of Geno Stone whom DeCosta called probably the best seventh-round pick in franchise history left an unheralded playmaker-sized hole on the Raven safety depth chart. With their second-to-last pick in this year's draft, they take a swing at hopefully finding another who fits the mold with former Falcon who is the cousin of Ravens legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer Ed Reed. Taylor had a great final collegiate season in which earned the prestigious Jim Thorpe Award after recording 74 total tackles, including five for a loss three interceptions and four pass breakups. The Ravens brought him in for one of their top 30 pre-draft visits and he'd provide additional value as a core special teams contributor.\n\nNo. 250 overall -- Karsen Barnhart, OL, Michigan\n\nWith their final selection in this year's draft, the Ravens will add a third offensive lineman in the former Wolverine who was starting experience playing four of the five spots with the exception of center. He made 31 career starts for the reigning NCAA Division I national champions, is excellent at executing pull blocks and would bolster the depth at multiple spots. The Ravens met with the athletic lineman ahead of Michigan's Pro Day back in March so he certainly will be a prospect they'll be monitoring as Day 3 comes to a close.", "source": {"uri":

There will still be plenty of quality options available when Baltimore is slated to be on the clock, with plenty of possible outcomes.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_DeCosta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric DeCosta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/L_oAgdCxRTXmOXAz8nK_Gg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/baltimore_ravens_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_532/51f422f5f293de6c6e600b18304f3ad7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506601", "eventUri": "eng-9506601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

News of the wide receiver's fresh terms broke on Wednesday, April 25.\n\nGeneral manager Eric DeCosta made the following statement: \"We are pleased to announce that we have extended Rashod Bateman's contract through the 2026 season. Congratulations to 'Bate' and his family. This is good day for the Ravens.\"\n\nBateman still having a future with the Ravens is somewhat surprising. He's struggled with injuries and drops since being selected 27th overall in the 2021 NFL draft.\n\nDespite those issues, DeCosta and the front office clearly felt comfortable letting Bateman make franchise history. As ESPN's Jamison Hensley put it, \"The Ravens have drafted six wide receivers in the first round in their history. Rashod Bateman is the first to get a second contract with Baltimore.\"\n\nThat's a distinction Bateman earned a mere \"eight days before the deadline on whether to exercise his 5th-year option,\" per Hensley.\n\nThe Ravens deciding to bet on Bateman's enduring and long-term potential has two implications. First, it quashes any trade talk involving the wideout.\n\nSecond, Bateman staying put means the Ravens may not be players for a new receiver during the early rounds of this year's draft.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dudko@heavy.com", "name": "James Dudko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashod_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashod Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1687007459-e1713982020809.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506601", "eventUri": "eng-9506601", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 261, "textEnd": 269}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

{"uri": "8095528577", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-04-24", "time": "19:44:53", "dateTime": "2024-04-24T19:44:53Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-04-24T19:44:42Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.longbeachstar.com/news/274306891/ravens-seven-round-mock-draft", "title": "Ravens Seven-Round Mock Draft", "body": "The predictions are finally in ink, as Ryan Mink and Garrett Downing take a stab at predicting each Ravens draft pick.\n\nAs a reminder, this comes with ZERO insider knowledge from anyone in the Ravens front office or scouting department. We don't get any clues. This is just two guys making their guesses.\n\nEric DeCosta takes another swing at wide receiver, drafting his fourth in the first round over the past six years. The next step for the passing offense to take is to consistently hit more deep shots. An athletic freak, Mitchell would provide that target for Lamar Jackson. He's a 6-foot-2 burner who blazed the 40-yard dash in 4.34 seconds, can climb the ladder, and has a penchant for making clutch plays. Mitchell can contribute as a rookie and continue to keep Jackson's arsenal well-stocked for years to come.\n\nSecond Round (No. 62) - OT Kingsley Suamataia, BYU\n\nBehind the top six, there doesn't seem to be any consensus on how the offensive tackle board stacks up. Suamataia and Houston's Patrick Paul, in particular, seem to have wild ranges of where they're projected to be picked. With good size and nimble feet, Suamataia has the tools to be a premier offensive tackle at either left or right tackle. Cousin to Detroit Lions offensive tackle Penei Swell, Suamataia needs some technique refinement, but the Ravens have one of the best in the business to handle that in Offensive Line Coach Joe D'Alessandris.\n\nThird Round (No. 93) - OT Brandon Coleman, TCU\n\nThe Ravens aren't joking around about rebuilding in the trenches, and they go heavy with back-to-back offensive linemen. Coleman is a wide-bodied brawler with great mobility. He posted eye-popping athleticism at the Combine and logged snaps at every offensive line position other than center at TCU. Coleman could stay at tackle or kick inside to guard, where the 6-foot-4 blocker may shine most.\n\nFourth Round (No. 113) - S Malik Mustapha, Wake Forest\n\nMustapha may be the best tackling prospect in this year's draft. He seeks and destroys from the depths of the secondary. Mustapha isn't a big guy, standing in at 5-foot-10, 206 pounds, but that's not much different from Geno Stone, who departed in free agency. A highly respected team leader, Mustapha didn't have Stone's kind of ball production, but he would be a valuable addition to the secondary and special teams units.\n\nFourth Round (No. 130) - CB Cam Hart, Notre Dame\n\nI would have liked to get a cornerback earlier in the draft, but there's a lot to like about Hart and Kyle Hamilton would agree. They're very close friends. Hart stands in at 6-foot-3, 202 pounds and was a three-year starter as an outside cornerback. He was named to Bruce Feldman's \"Freaks List\" and was voted a team captain for his final year in South Bend.\n\nFifth Round (No. 165) - RB Isaac Guerendo, Louisville\n\nWith Keaton Mitchell rehabbing, the Ravens grab another speed merchant to add to their backfield. Guerendo ran the 40-yard dash in seconds and has experience as a pass catcher (22 receptions for 234 last season). He also has good size at 6-foot, 221 pounds with a muscular lower half that not only helps him run past tacklers, but through them. A Hamstring injury limited him during his time at Wisconsin, but if he can stay healthy in the NFL, Guerendo could provide instant juice behind Derrick Henry.\n\nSixth Round (No. 218) - OLB Javon Solomon, Troy\n\nSolomon led the FBS in sacks with 16 last season and tallied 32.5 over his career. The issue is his size. He's under 6-foot-1 and 246 pounds. However, Solomon has very long arms (80-inch wingspan), which gives him natural leverage. His build is reminiscent of former Raven Elvis Dumervil. Solomon isn't the typical big-bodied edge setter the Ravens go for, but they drafted that on Day 3 last year with Tavius Robinson. Solomon would give Baltimore a quarterback hunter they could work into the mix on passing downs.\n\nSeventh Round (No. 228) - DT Khristian Boyd, Northern Iowa\n\nThe Ravens like to keep their pipeline of defensive linemen well stocked and Boyd is described as the \"heart and soul\" of the team. He's a stout, physical defensive tackle who could work his way into the rotation this season or down the road.\n\nSeventh Round (No. 250) - G Trevor Keegan, Michigan\n\nAnother offensive lineman? You're darn right. There's a world in which Suamataia and Coleman become the Ravens' long-term tackles. Keegan would add more competition at guard. He was a three-year starter for Jim Harbaugh. While his measurements don't pop, Keegan was a reliable, blue-collar blocker for the national champions.\n\nOur insiders, Ryan Mink and Garrett Downing, explain their Ravens mock picks for all seven rounds of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Ravens are in the market for offensive linemen, and that rebuilding process starts at pick No. 30. Morgan was a three-year starter at left tackle for Arizona, and he could step in as an immediate starter at tackle or guard in Baltimore. Standing in at 6-foot-5, 311 pounds, Morgan doesn't come with off-the-charts physical tools like Amarius Mims or Tyler Guyton, but he's a proven, productive player with NFL ready ability. Morgan suffered a torn ACL at the end of the 2022 season, but he recovered from that and proved himself with strong 2023 campaign. Some draft analysts believe his best position in the NFL may be at guard, which could hurt his stock as a first-round talent. But that guard-tackle flexibility could be attractive to the Ravens, especially for this season, and Morgan could potentially grow into a left tackle role at the NFL level.\n\nSecond Round (No. 62) - CB Kamari Lassiter, Georgia\n\nThe Georgia defender helped the Bulldogs win a pair of national championships during his time on campus, and he brings a mentality that would fit perfectly on the Ravens defense. Lassiter has good instincts, size (6-0, 186), and athleticism that would translate well to the NFL game. He would give the Ravens immediate cornerback depth, while helping to rebuild the position over the long-term. At the NFL Combine, Lassiter spoke highly about the potential of joining the Ravens. \"That would be an amazing opportunity,\" he said. \"They pride themselves on defense and I pride myself on defense.\"\n\nThird Round (No. 93) - WR Brenden Rice, USC\n\nThe Ravens have a long history of drafting players with NFL bloodlines, and they take that approach again by drafting the son of Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice. Brenden is a big-bodied (6-2, 208) receiver who made steady improvement throughout his college career, first at Colorado before transferring to USC. He caught 12 touchdowns last year for the Trojans and he would give the Ravens a big, physical target for Lamar Jackson.\n\nFourth Round (No. 113) - OT Matt Goncalves, Pitt\n\nThe process of building up the tackle room continues in the fourth round with the pick the Ravens obtained by trading Morgan Moses to the Jets. Goncalves (6-6, 327) played both tackle spots in college, so he could provide immediate depth at right and left tackle. Goncalves is a quality player and team captain who has started games over the last four years.\n\nFourth Round (No. 130) - OLB Jalyx Hunt, Houston Christian\n\nThe Ravens dip into the small school waters to find a mid-round pass rusher with great potential. Hunt is an intriguing prospect with great size (6-4, 252) and athleticism who really blossomed at Houston Christian after starting his career as a safety at Cornell. He was the Southland Conference Defensive Player of the Year last season, putting up nine tackles for loss, 6.5 sacks and 2.5 forced fumbles. He will need to add strength and develop as a player in making the jump to the NFL, but Hunt could be another small-school gem for the Ravens.\n\nFifth Round (No. 165) - DT Tyler Davis, Clemson\n\nThe defensive tackle would give the Ravens immediate depth in the middle of the defensive line. He was a highly recruited player out of high school who landed at Clemson and battled through injuries for much of his college career.\n\nSixth Round (No. 218) - S Daijahn Anthony, Ole Miss\n\nAnthony was a productive player at Ole Miss, putting up 61 tackles and three interceptions last year. He would give the Ravens an immediate contributor on special teams and also brings versatility to the back end of the defense. The 6-foot-0, 195-pound Anthony can play nickel or safety, which is a trend for how the Ravens have used their safeties in recent years.\n\nSeventh Round (No. 228) - RB Rasheen Ali, Marshall\n\nAli was a productive player for Marshall who topped 1,000 rushing yards twice in his college career. The 5-foot-11, 206-pound back suffered a torn biceps at the Senior Bowl, which could hurt his stock and make him available later than expected. The Ravens have gone that route with other prospects such as David Ojabo and Andrew Vorhees, and they could get great value by taking Ali late in the draft.\n\nSeventh Round (No. 250) - LB Steele Chambers, Ohio State\n\nRavens add some depth at linebacker and get a player who can step into a role on special teams. Led the team in tackles last year and was honorable mention All-American. Big-10 each of the last two seasons. He was a former running back who transitioned to linebacker.", "source": {"uri": "longbeachstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Long Beach Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As expected, many experts have the Ravens picking one of those three positions.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nOf those nine experts, only two players appeared twice to form some type of consensus: Amarius Mims, an offensive tackle from Georgia, and Chop Robinson, an edge rusher from Penn State.\n\nAccording to The Sporting News' draft big board, both players would rank as steals for the Ravens at the 30th pick.\n\nNFL DRAFT RANKINGS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | EDGE\n\nHere's who the experts think the Ravens will draft in the first round:\n\nCris Collinsworth, PFF -- Jordan Morgan, T, Arizona\n\nCollinsworth's reasoning: \"[Morgan] isn't flashy. but he's a complete player who consistently gets in front of people, can play inside and wins consistently. He plays with good energy, always battles and, even when beaten, exerts great effort to recover.\"\n\nField Yates, ESPN -- Darius Robinson, DE, Missouri\n\nYates' reasoning: \"The Ravens lost Jadeveon Clowney in free agency this offseason, but Robinson would keep this Baltimore pass rush strong.\"\n\nJamison Hensley, ESPN -- Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia\n\nHensley's reasoning: \"The Ravens fill their biggest need with Mims, who didn't allow a sack at Georgia. Mims will start immediately at right tackle.\"\n\nTyler Forness, The Sporting News -- Chop Robinson, EDGE, Penn State\n\nForness' reasoning: \"The Ravens capitalize on my fourth-ranked player in the class, which is what they do every year: take the player who is just that good who shouldn't be available.\"\n\nCharles McDonald and Charles Tice, Yahoo -- Tyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma\n\nReasoning: \"[Guyton] has quality starting tackle upside, something so hard to find at this point in the draft, and wouldn't necessarily need to play right away.\"\n\nPeter Schrager, NFL.com -- Kool-Aid McKinstry, CB, Alabama\n\nSchrager's reasoning: \"I know teams that absolutely love him ... The Alabama-to-Baltimore pipeline is real.\"\n\nLance Zierlein, NFL.com -- Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia\n\nZierlein's reasoning: \"If Mims falls here, Baltimore could do much worse than adding one of the most physically gifted specimens in this draft.\"\n\nDanny Kelly, The Ringer -- Chop Robinson, EDGE, Penn State\n\nKelly's reasoning: \"Baltimore really should be going offensive line no matter what,

Robinson has the best first step in this class and the upside of a pass rusher who can produce double-digit sacks.\n\nNFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah: Nate Wiggins, CB, Clemson\n\nThe Ravens always value players who can rush the quarterback and guys who can cover pass catchers. Wiggins has outstanding cover ability, but Baltimore will need to help him be a little more of an urgent defender against the run.\n\nNFL.com's Lance Zierlein: Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia\n\nThe Ravens need to eventually find a right tackle -- and they might need to find one for this season. If Mims falls here, Baltimore could do much worse than adding one of the most physically gifted specimens in this draft.\n\nESPN's Field Yates: Darius Robinson, EDGE, Missouri\n\nRobinson does a little bit of everything and is super versatile. He was a defensive tackle early in his Missouri career before moving into an edge role, finishing with 8.5 sacks in his final season. The Ravens lost Jadeveon Clowney in free agency this offseason, but Robinson would keep this Baltimore pass rush strong.\n\nCBS Sports' Pete Prisco: Jordan Morgan, OT, Arizona\n\nThey could consider receiver Xavier Worthy here, but in the end I think their line needs more help. Morgan could play right tackle or slide inside to guard.\n\nPFF's Trevor Sikkema: Tyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma (via trade UP to No. 23)\n\nGuyton's experience and technique are raw, but he is a high-ceiling offensive tackle. The Ravens will likely take a tackle sometime in Round 1. Here, they trade up for one of the last sure-fire first-round projections at the position.\n\nSporting News' Vinnie Iyer: Graham Barton, OT, Duke\n\nThe Ravens need to get an option for either right tackle or left guard to keep the strength of their offensive line intact after they moved on from Morgan Moses and Kevin Zeitler.

Instead of opting in, the Ravens are doubling down and choosing to make a long-term commitment to Bateman.\n\nBateman, 24, started 12 games for the Ravens last season, recording 32 passes for 367 yards and a touchdown. While the numbers don't jump off the page, Bateman has slid into a role as the third receiving option on the team behind second-year pro Zay Flowers and tight end Mark Andrews.\n\nBateman has had his fair share of injuries, missing 17 games in his first three years, but he is healthy going into the offseason and fixtures to be a big part of the Ravens offense next season.\n\nWith Bateman signed on long-term, it likely decreases the chances of the Ravens taking a receiver with a high draft pick during this weekend's NFL Draft.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_brener@si.com", "name": "Jeremy Brener", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashod_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashod Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Flowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zay Flowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Andrews (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3648,h_2052,x_0,y_337/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw8jpbb1k0gnfrg7wk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506601", "eventUri": "eng-9506601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

This year's incoming crop of first-year players will be expected to contribute as a starter or in a vital role as a heavy rotational piece.\n\nWith the sizable contracts they are currently paying, the most notable being two-time MVP-winning quarterback Lamar Jackson and All-Pro defensive tackle Justin Madubuike, the Ravens need to target prospects who they can plug in and play right away at positions of need because they will be more reliant on younger talent than ever before.\n\nThe third position group to be broken down in this short article series is one always of high interest among the Ravens fan base: wide receiver. The Ravens re-signed nine-year veteran Nelson Agholor who was a solid role player last year and are returning Flowers and 2021 first-rounder Rashod Bateman who could be heading into the final year of his rookie deal depending on what the team decides to exercise his fifth-year option. However, three-time Pro Bowler Odell Beckham Jr. is unlikely to to return after saying his farewells to the fans on social media and two-time Pro Bowler Devin Duvernay signed with Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency. Here are potential plug-and-play prospects at the very deep position group whom Ravens' general manager Eric DeCosta could target and get immediate contributions from.\n\nThe former Longhorn fits a common theme among most of the prospects who will be featured in this article. He is a big-bodied pass catcher who can work inside and out but is especially dominant on the perimeter. Mitchell is coming off a 2023 season in which he recorded career highs with 55 receptions, 845 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns, with an average of 15.4 yards per catch. Before transferring to Texas and had the best statistical season of his career last year, he spent the previous two winning back-to-back NCAA Division FBS national championships at Georgia with Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken in a limited yet impactful role in the Bulldogs offense, especially during the postseason.\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 202 pounds, Mitchell is the total package when it comes to how he adds a playmaking presence to an offense. He can make big plays all over the field, including over the middle, on the boundary and deep. Mitchell showcased his blazing vertical speed at the NFL Scouting Combine when he ran a 4.34-second in the 40-yard dash, which is arguably just as impressive as the record-breaking 4.21-second sprint fellow Longhorn Xavier Worthy ran, given the near 40-pound weight difference.\n\nIf Mitchell somehow slips past the wide receiver-needy Buffalo Bills at No. 28 overall in the first round, he'd be a tremendous value at No. 30 for the Ravens\n\nThe former Seminole is one of the most polarizing prospects at the position in this year's loaded draft class despite being one of his most gifted and electric. His lack of blazing vertical speed, ability to consistently separate and the 4.61-second 40-yard dash he ran at the combine will likely push him out of first-round consideration for most teams. But, his elevated game speed he showed in the gauntlet drill at the Combine, contested catch ability and play-making prowess with the ball in his hands after the catch will make him a Day 2 steal.\n\nColeman is coming off a second straight standout season in 2023 after he transferred from Michigan State and led the Seminoles with 50 catches for 658 receiving yards and a career-high 11 touchdowns.\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 213 pounds, Coleman is built and plays like the prototypical \"X\" receiver Ravens fans have been clamoring for and their offenses have been missing since they traded away Anquan Boldin following the second Super Bowl run in franchise history. Much like the future Hall of Famer, Coleman does his best work when the ball is up for grabs. He has more juice in space than most receivers of his size, so much so his coaches used him as a punt returner last year and he added 300 more yards to his all-purpose total with an average of 12.4 yards per return.\n\nWhile some pundits might view using a first-round pick, even one as low as No. 30 overall in Coleman as a bit of a reach, there is next-to-no chance the Ravens have a chance at him in the bottom of the second at their current No. 62 pick. DeCosta could opt to trade out of the first round entirely and take him in the early to mid-second while recouping additional draft capital to address the team's other needs.\n\nThe former Bulldog isn't exactly big-bodied at 6-foot and 186 pounds. He isn't small either, but he is a dangerous weapon all the same. While most route-running technicians at the receiver position of his complexion are often automatically labeled as slot-only types, McConkey is a do-it-all type, capable of making big plays and coming up with crucial catches lined up inside or out wide. He spent his entire career at Georgia, including being teammates with Mitchell under Monken when the Bulldogs won consecutive titles from 2021-22.\n\nMcConkey is an explosive athlete capable of playing bigger than his size suggests by how he can go up for and come down with contested catches. He can be electric with the ball in his hands, showcasing both elusiveness in the open field to make defenders miss and 4.39-second breakaway speed to run away from them or take the top off the defense in vertical routes.\n\nWhile he never put up prolific numbers as a catcher and dealt with the occasional minor injury, McConkey's tape tells the tale of a dynamic weapon whose game can translate well at the next level. Some pundits believe his skillset is a little too similar to Flowers, but what makes them both so dynamic is how they can play bigger than they are, threaten every level of the defense and are reliable security blankets with knacks for finding the soft spot in zones. Surrounding Jackson with more weapons who can do a lot of everything at a high level will never be a bad route to go with.\n\nThe former Gator's profile closely mirrors McConkey's and it's not just because they are both Caucasian. Pearsall can all do it all as well, ranging from being a technically sound route runner to being an explosive playmaker with the ball in his hands after the catch. He is also taller and heavier at 6-foot-1 and 189 pounds, but can play above the rim and go up for and haul in contested catches. Pearsall also has great hands and a knack for making impressive catches with one or both of his 9.25-inch mitts, including arguably the best catch in all of college football last year which was made even more legendary by how he absorbed being sandwiched between multiple defenders and still held onto the first-down catch.\n\nPearsall began his collegiate career at Arizona State before transferring and becoming the Gators' leading receiver over the past two seasons. He saved the best for last as he set career highs with 65 receptions, 965 receiving yards and recorded six touchdowns from scrimmage for a second straight season. Pearsall can stretch the field vertically with speed and crisp route running, making him a threat to take a screen or seam the distance for a score.\n\nThere's a solid chance Pearsall could still be on the board when the Ravens come on the clock on Day 2 at No. 62 overall. Some pundits who love his game and potential have been as bold as to mock him to come off the board in the late first round, ahead of other fringe first-rounders such as McConkey, Coleman and the next prospect on the list.\n\nThe former Gamecock was primarily used as a return specialist for some reason for his first four seasons in college despite being built like the second coming of A.J. Brown. In his breakout fifth-year senior season, Legette's role expanded and he dominated on the outside, putting up monster numbers with 71 catches, 1,255 yards and seven touchdowns. He emerged as a deep-ball and contested catch merchant whose years of returning kicks manifested themselves in an explosive run after the catch ability.\n\nWhile Legette has drawn a lot of comparisons to D.K. Metcalf, at 6-foot-1 and 221 pounds with his playing style, he is a carbon copy of Brown, who went in the second round back in 2019 and has since gone on to become a three-time Pro Bowler. His body control on the boundary, presence as a threat in the red zone and ferocity as a run blocker make him a great fit for the type of role the Ravens are looking to add at the position. There's a chance he might still fall in their laps on Day 2, where he could prove to be just as big of a steal as the pro players he is constantly compared.\n\nThe former Huskie is one of the most well-rounded receivers in this entire class and another prospect at the position who does his best work lined up on the outside. Polk is coming off a career year where he was the second-leading receiver for the national title runner-ups behind projected top-10 pick Rome Odunze. In 15 games, he recorded career highs with 69 catches, 1,159 yards and nine touchdowns, with an average of 16.8 yards per catch.\n\nEven though he is 6-foot-1 and just over 200 pounds, he plays on the boundary with the same commanding presence of a pass catcher four inches and 20-30 pounds heavier. He specializes in making contested catches, tracks the ball well down the field and runs crisp well-paced routes. Polk has also begun to garner some late first to early second-round buzz but if he is still on the board for the Ravens at No. 62 overall, the value he presents might be too good to pass up.\n\nThe former Knight brings a great blend of size, speed and explosive play-making ability to the table and has all the makings of a natural \"X\" receiver. Baker is coming off the best season of his career in which he led the team in receiving yards for the second year in a row, recording a career-high 1,159 yards on 52 receptions. He also caught seven touchdowns and averaged the second-most yards per catch in the country with 21.9 yards. Baker has strong hands and displays excellent body control and even though he ran a 4.51-seconds in the 40-yard dash at the combine, his tape showed another gear where he can pull away from defenders and eliminate angles once he gets in the open field.\n\nIn most years, Baker might be a fringe late first to early second round option, but given the wealth of talent at the position in this year's class, there is a more than solid chance the Ravens could wait until the third round to take him. Although, if they elected to not risk him getting poached before they are on the clock at No. 93 overall, DeCosta might consider pulling the trigger a round earlier at No. 62 and it wouldn't really be viewed as a reach given the role he'd play and the potential impact he could have right away.", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltimore Beatdown"},

But how high, and at what cost? A review of trades over the past decade found that DeCosta's draft pick values largely align with those in Jimmy Johnson's long-cited trade value chart. If that calculus doesn't change, here's where the Ravens could move up in the first round with various two-pick trade packages.\n\nNo. 29 (Detroit Lions): Nos. 30 and 165 (fifth round) overall\n\nNo. 28 (Buffalo Bills): Nos. 30 and 130 (fourth round)\n\nNo. 27 (Arizona Cardinals): Nos. 30 and 113 (fourth round)\n\nNo. 24 (Dallas Cowboys): Nos. 30 and 93 (third round)\n\nNo. 18 (Cincinnati Bengals): Nos. 30 and 62 (second round)\n\nIn the few instances when the Ravens have traded up under DeCosta, they've targeted prospects with rare physical gifts. A handful of players expected to be taken in the low to mid-20s in this year's draft fit that profile and would also fill a need on the Ravens' roster: Georgia offensive tackle Amarius Mims, LSU wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr., Iowa cornerback Cooper DeJean and Penn State edge rusher Chop Robinson.\n\nNo. 30 (Round 1): Oklahoma OT Tyler Guyton\n\nNo. 62 (Round 2): South Carolina WR Xavier Legette\n\nThough the receiver class is deeper than the cornerback class, Legette (6-1, 221 pounds) is an NFL-sized target who can make contested catches and has tremendous speed, reaching 22.3 mph on one play last season. His route running isn't as smooth, but his size and ball skills give Jackson a great target opposite Zay Flowers, especially with Rashod Bateman's future murky if the Ravens decline his fifth-year option.\n\nNo. 93 (Round 3): Oregon CB Khyree Jackson\n\nNo. 113 (Round 4): Miami S Kamren Kinchens\n\nNo. 130 (Round 4): Washington State EDGE Brennan Jackson\n\n___\n\nNo. 30 (Round 1): Arizona OT/G Jordan Morgan\n\nNo. 62 (Round 2): Kentucky CB Andru Phillips\n\nWhat the 5-11, 190-pound corner lacks in size and speed (4.48-second 40-yard dash) he more than makes up for with physicality and toughness. And he's far from a middling athlete, posting a 42-inch vertical jump and an 11-foot, 3-inch broad jump that both rank in the 97th percentile at the position in the MockDraftable database.\n\nNo. 93 (Round 3): Southern California WR Brenden Rice\n\nCORNERBACKS (9) -- Marlon Humphrey, Brandon Stephens, Arthur Maulet, Jalyn Armour-Davis, Damarion Williams, Trayvon Mullen, Ka'dar Hollman, Tre Swilling, Christian Matthew\n\nConcern level: MODERATE/HIGH\n\nSkinny: Though the starters look good on paper, the lack of depth at both cornerback and safety impacts the secondary's overall concern level as new defensive coordinator Zach Orr will want to have as much positional flexibility as possible. The nickel spot has multiple options, but the outside depth behind Humphrey -- who missed a career-high eight games last season -- and Stephens is totally unproven. The Ravens have selected just one corner (Stephens) on Day 1 or Day 2 of the last six drafts, a streak that probably needs to end this week.\n\nSAFETIES (3) -- Kyle Hamilton, Marcus Williams, Ar'Darius Washington\n\nConcern level: MODERATE\n\nSkinny: Hamilton and Williams are one of the NFL's best safety duos, but the 5-foot-8 Washington is the only other listed safety on the roster and he's much more of a nickel back than a viable backup to the two starters. In other words, finding a replacement for Geno Stone is a clear need, especially if Orr wants to have the flexibility to move Hamilton all over the defense like Mike Macdonald did.\n\nDay 2\n\nMax Melton, CB, Rutgers: His stock seemed to rise in the pre-draft process, and it's easy to see why. He's long (5-foot-11 and 187 pounds), fast (ran a 4.39 40-yard dash at the combine), has really good ball skills (eight interceptions, four fumble recoveries and 22 pass breakups), can play both inside and outside, and he's really good on special teams.\n\nDay 3\n\nKhyree Jackson, CB, Oregon: The Alabama transfer made a lot of strides in his final college season, leading the Ducks with three interceptions and 10 pass breakups to go along with two sacks and five tackles for losses. A Prince George's County, Md., native, Jackson has a lot of developing to do, but his size, skill set and swagger make him an intriguing prospect.\n\nTykee Smith, S, Georgia: Another smaller safety who plays bigger than his 5-foot-10, 202-pound size, Smith is an instinctual player who finds a way to make impactful plays. In his final collegiate season, he had four interceptions, 8 1/2 tackles for loss, two sacks and four pass breakups. The Ravens covet smart and physical defensive backs.\n\nVERSATILE SAFETY\n\nEarly: Cooper DeJean, Iowa\n\nLater: Omar Brown, Nebraska\n\nThis will easily be my biggest value play of the group, as DeJean looks to be a first-round selection, while Brown is unlikely to be taken before Day 3.\n\nDeJean could stay at cornerback if he's drafted by a team that relies on zone coverage, but considering his tightness while changing directions, he may be better served by a position change to safety, where he can use his instincts, ball skills and straight-line speed to make plays from off the ball. Considering how many big plays he made on returns for Iowa, the new kickoff rules certainly help his stock.\n\nBrown lined up all over the place in Nebraska's secondary, with a lot of his reps coming in the slot. He was targeted 60 times in coverage last season but surrendered just 35 catches for 259 yards and no touchdowns. He also forced seven incompletions and missed just two tackles in run support. At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds with a 4.52-second 40-yard dash, he has the requisite size and speed to potentially be one of the final-day gems of the class.", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com",

Ngata made five Pro Bowls during his tenure with the team. Ngata's best season with the Ravens came in 2011 when he recorded a career-high 64 tackles, while recovering three fumbles and scoring one for a touchdown. He was also apart of the team's Super Bowl champion in the 2012 season and played alongside some of the best Ravens ever, including linebacker Ray Lewis and safety Ed Reed.\n\nNgata spent three seasons with the Detroit Lions (2015-17) and one with the Philadelphia Eagles (2018) before retiring, but history will remember him as one of the greatest defenders in Ravens franchise history. He was inducted into the team's Ring of Honor in October 2021.\n\nNow, he'll have a chance to continue the legacy and welcome the newest Raven to the flock.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_brener@si.com", "name": "Jeremy Brener", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloti_Ngata", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haloti Ngata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3160,h_1777,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hwbaf8r872ff3f9s1b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506601", "eventUri": "eng-9506601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Last season, Baltimore finished with the best record in the NFL (13-4), and Lamar Jackson won his second MVP award.\n\nAfter leading the NFL in rushing last season, the Ravens signed Derrick Henry in free agency. Henry, 30, accounted for nearly 10,000 rushing yards after spending the first eight years of his career in Tennessee.\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft kicks off in Detroit on Thursday night, and Baltimore will address the offensive line after losing three starters from last season. Both starting guards, John Simpson and Kevin Zeitler, left in free agency while starting right tackle Morgan Moses was traded to the Jets.\n\nWith the draft quickly approaching, we're looking at the final experts picks in a variety of mock drafts.\n\nThe Ringer -- Chop Robinson, DE, Penn State\n\n31. San Francisco 49ers - Chop Robinson, DE, Penn State\n\nThe Ringer has Baltimore taking a pass rusher over an offensive tackle.\n\nBaltimore really should be going offensive line no matter what, but, man -- if Robinson falls to them, wouldn't it feel so Ravens-y for them to snag him? Baltimore went for an explosive Penn State pass rusher a few seasons ago in Odafe Oweh, who has been only a rotational player for them, but Robinson fits the mold they've pursued in recent drafts in Oweh and Michigan's David Ojabo. I don't think Eric DeCosta will be put off by recent misses, especially with the shoes of Jadeveon Clowney to fill.\n\nNFL.com -Graham Barton, OL, Duke\n\nNov 11, 2023; Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; Duke Blue Devils offensive lineman Graham Barton (62) before the game at Kenan Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nEric Edholm has Baltimore landing Graham Barton out of Duke.\n\nBarton could be the first center drafted, and there are other teams I could see jumping on him ahead of this spot. But in this scenario, he goes after Frazier and falls to the Ravens, who have center covered (by Tyler Linderbaum) but do have starting jobs open elsewhere on the line. Barton might fit best at guard, though he also has 34 college starts at left tackle, so Baltimore could try him outside, too. Either way, he's a tough, smart and ornery blocker who has the makeup to settle in as a quality pro.\n\nPFF -BALTIMORE RAVENS: T JC LATHAM, ALABAMA\n\nSep 30, 2023; Starkville, Mississippi, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide offensive lineman JC Latham (65) celebrates with a cow bell in Davis Wade Stadium at Mississippi State University. Alabama defeated Mississippi State 40-17. Mandatory Credit: Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News\n\nPFF has the Ravens landing a top offensive tackle.\n\nAfter trading away Morgan Moses, the Ravens seeing one of the top right tackle prospects in the draft fall to them would be an ideal scenario. Latham earned PFF pass- and run-blocking grades of 81.7 and 79.6, respectively, and would be a plug-and-play starter on the right side.\n\nESPN -Jason Reid: Trade\n\nMar 2, 2022; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Baltimore Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta during the NFL Combine at the Indiana Convention Center. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJason Reid has Baltimore trading back into Round 2 for picks 36 and 78.\n\nKeep an eye on Washington late on Thursday night. I'm hearing the Commanders might consider trading back into the first round for an offensive tackle. And because I have five off the board, this might be a good spot to jump on one of the final two OTs in my top 32 rankings. Baltimore, meanwhile, can slide back six spots and add a Day 2 selection for its troubles.\n\nAt pick 36, the Ravens land Darius Robinson out of Missouri.\n\nThere isn't a defensive end in this class who matches the Ravens' scheme better than Robinson. With an NFL-ready frame at 6-foot-5 and 285 pounds, he has strength, can set a firm edge and is plenty explosive as a pass-rusher. Baltimore checks off a need and gets the best player available on the board.\n\nNew York Post: Nate Wiggins, CB, Clemson\n\nDec 3, 2022; Charlotte, North Carolina, USA; Clemson Tigers cornerback Nate Wiggins (20) breaks up a pass intended for North Carolina Tar Heels wide receiver Antoine Green (3) in the second quarter at Bank of America Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New York Post has Baltimore landing a smooth cornerback out of Clemson.\n\nThe Ravens have a sneaky need for a cornerback, and it would be tough to pass up Wiggins' elite speed and coverage talent if he's still available.\n\nNBC Sports Philadelphia -- Ennis Rakestraw, CB, Missouri\n\nNov 19, 2022; Columbia, Missouri, USA; Missouri Tigers defensive back Ennis Rakestraw Jr. (2) breaks up a pass intended for New Mexico State Aggies wide receiver Justice Powers (6) during the first half at Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\n\nReuben Frank has Baltimore landing All-SEC cornerback, Ennis Rakestraw, out of Missouri.\n\nAt 5-foot-11, 185 pounds, and with 4.51 speed, Rakestraw doesn't move the needle in terms of size or speed. But he plays faster than his 40 time and is a strong and tough kid for his size. Rakestraw, the sixth (and final) corner taken in this year's first round, only had one interception in 35 games over four seasons at Missouri, so you wonder about his lack of production. But he did have 24 pass breakups and 8.0 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles and a sack, so he's pretty active. He's also been banged up - torn ACL as a sophomore and a groin injury this past year that cost him games. But he's a tough, aggressive corner who loves to compete. Whether that's enough to offset his lack of measurables remains to be seen. The Ravens haven't drafted a corner in the first two rounds since Marlon Humphrey in 2017, and while he's still going strong heading into his eighth season, the Ravens could use some help at corner around him.\n\nCBS Sports -Tyler Guyton\n\nOklahoma's Tyler Guyton (60) is pictured in the second half during a Bedlam college football game between the Oklahoma State University Cowboys (OSU) and the University of Oklahoma Sooners (OU) at Boone Pickens Stadium in Stillwater, Okla., Saturday, Nov. 4, 2023.\n\nCBS Sports has the Ravens adding an athletic right tackle.\n\nThe Ravens have needs all over the offensive line aside from center with three starters departing, and Guyton is someone who can be groomed to take over for Ronnie Stanley at left tackle after the veteran's contract was reworked for 2024. Stanley has also played just 31 games over the last four seasons, so Guyton may be needed sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Athletic -- Tyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma\n\nSep 2, 2023; Norman, Oklahoma, USA; Oklahoma Sooners offensive lineman Tyler Guyton (60) in action against the Arkansas State Red Wolves at Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJeff Zrebiec has the Ravens landing their right tackle of the future.\n\nGuyton only started 15 games in college, so he has plenty still to learn. However, the Ravens traditionally do a nice job developing linemen. With Guyton, there's so much to work with. He's a well-proportioned 6-foot-7, 322-pounder who has long arms, strong hands and tremendous athleticism for a big man. The Ravens, who need a young and talented offensive tackle after trading Morgan Moses last month, will happily deal with Guyton's inevitable growing pains. It was tempting to take Alabama cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry -- and don't be surprised if Baltimore does just that -- but it was too hard to pass up a plug-and-play right tackle with Guyton's upside. -- Jeff Zrebiec\n\nESPN NFL Nation -Amarius Mims, OL, Georgia\n\nJan 9, 2023; Inglewood, CA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs offensive lineman Amarius Mims (65) and offensive lineman Tate Ratledge (69) against the TCU Horned Frogs during the CFP national championship game at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJamison Hensley has Baltimore selecting Amarius Mims out of Georgia.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens could consider trading out of the first round if a team wants to move up to get a quarterback, but, if Mims is available, Baltimore will be ecstatic to make the pick. The Ravens fill their biggest need with Mims, who didn't allow a sack at Georgia. Mims will start immediately at right tackle. Adding a big-bodied blocker for reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson would be a best-case scenario for the Ravens.\n\nNFL.com-Tyler Guyton, OL, Oklahoma\n\nSep 2, 2023; Norman, Oklahoma, USA; Oklahoma Sooners offensive lineman Tyler Guyton (60) in action against the Arkansas State Red Wolves at Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCharles Davis has Baltimore landing their right tackle of the future.\n\nHead coach John Harbaugh has mentioned upgrading the offensive line, and Guyton will help do that. The former tight end has been a right tackle in college, but has the attributes to move to the blind side.\n\nNFL.com -Tyler Guyton, OL, OKlahoma\n\nSep 2, 2023; Norman, Oklahoma, USA; Oklahoma Sooners offensive lineman Tyler Guyton (60) in action against the Arkansas State Red Wolves at Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBucky Brooks is on the Tyler Guyton hype train.\n\nGeneral manager Eric DeCosta needs to address the edges with Morgan Moses traded away and Ronnie Stanley struggling with injuries. Guyton is an intriguing option as a potential Day 1 starter at right tackle, yet he has enough athleticism to eventually make a move to the left side of the line.\n\nPro Football Talk -Ladd McConkey\n\nDec 30, 2023; Miami Gardens, FL, USA; Georgia Bulldogs wide receiver Ladd McConkey (84) makes a catch and runs for touchdown against the Florida State Seminoles during the first half in the 2023 Orange Bowl at Hard Rock Stadium.

Mandatory Credit: Ken Ruinard-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn his final mock draft, Daniel Jeremiah has Baltimore landing a smooth, fluid cornerback.\n\nThe Ravens always value players who can rush the quarterback and guys who can cover pass catchers. Wiggins has outstanding cover ability, but Baltimore will need to help him be a little more of an urgent defender against the run.", "source": {"uri": "ravenswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Here's what some NFL Mock Drafts predict", "body": "BALTIMORE - The Baltimore Ravens will look to add to their already talented roster through this week's NFL Draft.\n\nWhile the Ravens have the 30th overall pick in the first round on Thursday, there are still gems to be found.\n\nIn fact, two-time NFL MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson was selected 32nd by the Ravens in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nFor the past two years, the Ravens hit gold in the first round of the draft. In 2022, Kyle Hamilton and Tyler Linderbaum -- both Pro Bowlers this past year -- were chosen in the first round.\n\nThen, in the 2023 draft, the Ravens took speedy wide receiver Zay Flowers, who led the team with 858 receiving yards.\n\nSo who will Baltimore target this year?\n\nThey have holes to fill at offensive line, cornerback, pass rusher and wide receiver.\n\nHere's who some NFL Mock Drafts have the Ravens selecting:\n\nCharles Davis, NFL.com: Tyler Guyton, Tackle, Oklahoma. The 6 feet, 8 inches, 322-pound tackle was Honorable Mention All-Big 12 in 2023 and started nine games.\n\n\"Ascending tackle prospect with the traits and tape to project a bright future as a high-level pass protector in the league,\" according to NFL.com.\n\nBucky Brooks, NFL.com: Tyler Guyton.\n\nDaniel Jeremiah, NFL.com: Cooper DeJean, cornerback, Iowa. DeJean was First-team Associated Press All-American in 2023, Big Ten Defensive Back of the Year, Return Specialist of the Year, First-team All-Big Ten Conference. He started 10 games, and had 41 tackles, two tackles for loss, two interceptions and five pass breakups. He did miss the end of the season with a broken fibula.\n\n\"Highly competitive defensive back with plus ball skills and noteworthy special teams value,\" NFL.com said. \"DeJean is big and bundled for a cornerback, with muscular arms and tight hips. He has fantastic interception production, but his movements are more linear than fluid, and he doesn't have the easy change of direction needed in man coverage on the next level.\"\n\nYahoo Sports: Tyler Guyton.\n\nNate Davis, USA Today: Amarius Mims, tackle, Georgia. The 6-foot-8, 340-pound tackle did not allow a sack and won two national championships while at Georgia.\n\n\"A right tackle who already knows OC Todd Monken's playbook, Mims' 87-inch wingspan and 6-8, 340-pound frame helps him block out the sun,\" USA Today says.\n\nRyan Wilson, CBS Sports: Amarius Mims.\n\nChris Trapasso, CBS Sports: Marshawn Kneeland, defensive lineman, Western Michigan. Kneeland was second-team All-MAC last season. He led the Broncos with 4.5 sacks. He also had 57 tackles and two forced fumbles.\n\n\"Kneeland is a former high school tight end and his open-field agility can be seen when he's pursuing the football around the field. He deals consequential first blows to opponents that often create openings for him to generate movement as a run defender or pass rusher,\" NFL.com says.\n\nConor Orr, Sports Illustrated: Ennis Rakestraw Jr., cornerback, Missouri. Rakestraw played in nine games with eight starts. He had 35 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, four pass breakups and a forced fumble.\n\n\"A physical ballhawk who can compete when a running play comes barreling right into his purview? That sounds like a Ravens cornerback to me. Continuing to build on the ascension of this versatile secondary is the key to Baltimore's success,\" Sports Illustrated says.\n\nPFF: Jordan Morgan, offensive tackle, Arizona. Morgan was a first-team All-Pac-12 Conference performer in 2023. He started 12 games at left tackle.\n\n\"Morgan is a smooth-moving prospect whose best position in the NFL might be guard. His track and field background gives him natural balance and core strength for good change-of-direction ability,\" PFF says.\n\nSporting News: Chop Robinson, defensive end, Penn State. The Gaithersburg, Maryland native was third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big Ten Conference. He had two forced fumbles, 15 tackles and four sacks.\n\n\"The Ravens capitalize on my fourth-ranked player in the class, which is what they do every year: take the player who is just that good who shouldn't be available,\" Sporting News says.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Baltimore was outplayed. As such, the Ravens are picking No. 30 in the 2024 NFL draft, a position with many pros and cons.\n\nWhen asked what picking at No. 30 can entail, Baltimore general manager Eric DeCosta said he doesn't see any unique challenges between picking early or late. He mentions that either way, you're trying to get value, and at the end of the day, you grade and rank players and select based on multiple factors.\n\n\"I don't see any unique challenges picking early [or] picking late. It's really the same. It's just having the players that you really want be there when you have to pick. If you have a typical Draft, if you're picking 10th, you maybe have four or five guys you really want. If you're picking 28th or 30th, you might only have 15 or 20 guys that you really want. The way your brain works, is you [assign] a value to players, and you're hoping to get that value at that pick. You really want to get value. For us, it's just you hope and pray that one of those top 20 guys might be there for us at [pick No.] 30 so we have some additional value associated with that. In the end, you just grade the players, and you rank the players.\"\n\nThe No. 30 pick could hold possible value for teams trying to trade to back into the first round, or there could be a fall of a player that the Ravens can get lucky with.

While the general manager might have the final say in who's selected, Baltimore relies more than ever on its scouting department and others throughout the team to ensure every option is exhausted.\n\nThis draft season, Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta had to go through his process without one of his closest companions, former Baltimore director of player personnel Joe Hortiz. DeCosta joked that there's more leg room now when he does press conferences that Hortiz used to attend, but he conceded that he misses him very much.\n\n\"There's definitely more leg room up here.\" (laughter) \"I'm probably more comfortable, because [former Ravens director of player personnel Joe Hortiz] was always butting into us. It's been a change for me, definitely. I miss Joe. I miss his personality. Joe's a great evaluator. First and foremost, for me, the comfort that I would have with Joe saying, 'Take a look at these guys and let me know what you think.' [He has] great instincts [and] great feel as an evaluator. In saying that, we have other guys that excel at that as well. [Head coach] John [Harbaugh] is a great evaluator. [Executive vice president] Ozzie Newsome's a Hall of Fame evaluator. [Director of player personnel] George Kokinis, [director of college scouting] David Blackburn - our coaches do a great job [as well]. We definitely have guys who can pick up the slack. I was thinking about it today coming in. I think this is my 20th year running the Draft. I think my first year was 2005 - the [former Ravens WR] Mark Clayton Draft. It's crazy to think that everything that goes into it [for] 20 years. Joe was with me for 19 of those 20 years. Obviously, it's a big change, but I think one that is exciting.

They've been known to find diamonds in the rough in later rounds, hit on early picks, and win draft season year in and year out.\n\nBaltimore's commitment to using the best player-available strategy is part of its success. When discussing the 2024 NFL draft, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh reaffirmed his commitment to selecting the best player available, explaining that things go deeper than pure need.\n\n\"I feel like you're trying to get Eric [DeCosta] ... The one he won't answer through me on that. To see if I'll give it up and maybe Harbaugh will chirp, or he's a canary. I'm a canary I guess.\" (laughter) \"Best available player. Isn't that what we said? It depends again. It depends on ... We do have some needs. I have my depth chart; there's no doubt, and Eric and I talk about that all the time - where the blocks are and where the goals are specifically for those guys. [It's] kind of what type of player do we need and what type of spot to build our team from the top to the bottom. There's a lot of thought that goes into it, [and] a lot of conversation that goes into that. So, it's not just a position. It's not just a, 'Hey, we need an offensive lineman, a guard, a tackle, wide receiver, a corner, a pass rusher, tight end or whatever.' It's what type of player do we need and what roles do we need filled? Even right through - from offense or defense right down through special teams - these are all the jobs that need to be done and who fills those jobs the best in a way that can win for us. [It's] not just, 'He can do that,' it's usually who's going to excel at what. And that is the team-building process, and that goes with the scheme, too. So sometimes you get players that are a little bit different, so you want to move your scheme that way. Sometimes you have a way you want to play, you have needs on your roster, so you move your Draft a little bit that way. I think that's the art of the whole thing.\"\n\nThe Ravens have always done an excellent job of addressing needs, but taking the best players on their board has been what pays dividends and keeps them in contention year in and year out. The strategy allows them to plan for the future while also understanding what they need in the moment. It also lets them plug and play a quality player at a position when a starter leaves due to immense depth.", "source": {"uri": "ravenswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ravens Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_oestreicher@ravenswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Kevin Oestreicher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/02/1470567915.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506601", "eventUri": "eng-9506601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

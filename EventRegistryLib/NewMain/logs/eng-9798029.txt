The oil-rich kingdom's purchase was relatively modest -- a reported $100 million -- but even in a minority role, Saudi-backed SRJ Sports Investments ensured mixed-martial arts events will take place in that country.\n\nFerreira has fought eight times since Ngannou's last MMA bout, including February's 21-second victory over longtime Bellator champion Ryan Bader.\n\n\"This is the fight of my life,\" Ferreira said. \"I am preparing like never before to bring Ngannou a whole lot of problems.\"\n\nAlso on the October card, Cris \"Cyborg\" Justino fights Larissa Pacheco.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ngannou", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ngannou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_270", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UFC 270"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciryl_Gane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ciryl Gane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Joshua", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Joshua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larissa_Pacheco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larissa Pacheco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Bader"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/fb-og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798029", "eventUri": "eng-9798029", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-19", "textStart": 405, "textEnd": 412}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

For the first time in 33 months, Francis Ngannou will make the walk to an octagon.\n\nThe former undisputed UFC heavyweight champion will return on Oct. 19 to face PFL heavyweight champion Renan Ferreira for the PFL Super Fight belt in Ngannou's debut with the promotion.\n\nSince defending his UFC heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane in January 2022, Ngannou has endured more than two years of negotiations, triumphs and heartbreak.\n\nAfter spending 2022 recovering from surgery and waiting out the end of his contract to become the most sought-after free agent in MMA history, he spent the first half of 2023 negotiating a deal with the PFL that would allow him to finally allow him to compete as a boxer.\n\nAnd then -- after a world-class performance against lineal heavyweight champ Tyson Fury and a loss against Anthony Joshua -- Ngannou suffered tragedy when his 15-month-old son died in April.\n\nOn Monday, Ngannou told The Athletic the loss left him with \"a lot of insecurity, a lot of uncertainty,\" and compared it to someone popping his life with a needle.\n\nWith Wednesday's announcement, the 37-year-old said he has eagerly returned to the normalcy of his professional career.\n\nAnd even after establishing himself as one of the most feared strikers in MMA history, he talked like a fighter hungry to prove himself.\n\n\"I have to prove that I can win this fight,\" he said.\n\n\"The purpose (of this sport) is competing, giving your best every day. So yes I think I have something to prove, that I can still give my best.\"\n\nAs for what kind of fighter fans can expect nearly three years after his last MMA bout, Ngannou was bluntly simple: Much of what they've already seen.\n\n\"Just the same thing,\" he said, later adding, \"I think I show up doing everything to win the fight, knowing that I didn't leave any stone unturned and that's what I'm expecting to bring.\"\n\nIf he's right, he could change the landscape of the industry. The PFL has long been seen as a second-tier, if not third-tier, promotion to the UFC. Ngannou debuting with the same one-punch power that turned UFC's heavyweight division upside down would give the PFL its most important moment.\n\nFerreira will be a formidable first opponent. The 6-foot-8, 34-year-old Brazillian is 13-3 and coming off a 21-second TKO of Ryan Bader in February for the \"PFL vs. Bellator Champion\" Super Belt. Before that, Ferreira defeated Denis Goltsov to win the 2023 PFL Heavyweight Tournament.\n\nIn an MMA era when \"superfights\" and long-hyped returns cause opponents to turn down years of other opportunities, such as Michael Chandler waiting for Conor McGregor in the UFC, this bout marks something different.\n\nFerreira took a calculated risk in sitting out the 2024 PFL season while he waited for Ngannou's return after earning the shot by defeating Bader. He told MMA Fighting in March, \"I'm very happy for this opportunity, and I hope it happens soon.\"\n\nNgannou doesn't talk lowly of Ferreira's patience, comparing it to his own situation with becoming a free agent.\n\n\"When you have that opportunity, you just jump on it,\" Ngannou told The Athletic. \"Just as I went after my own opportunity in leaving the UFC when I chose that was necessary, I did what I had to do for my own opportunity.\"\n\nIn the 15 months since signing with the PFL, Ngannou's tactic of waiting out his contract hasn't been duplicated by many others. But he doesn't lose hope in changing the industry and believes his risk in 2022 built MMA-wide awareness of how fighter contracts work.\n\nHe even said some fighters have approached him for guidance on how to negotiate their future deals.\n\n\"Rome wasn't built in one day. Change isn't going to come around from one day or one year, maybe not five years,\" he said. \"But you can be certain that a lot of people today make moves and decisions using that as an example.\"\n\nHe also doesn't lose any sleep over the years that he did lose.\n\n\"I wasn't missing anything. ... My decision was for what I wanted and I what I think I should have done for me, so I don't have regret.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, look at me. I think things played out for me just perfectly.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_puleo@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Puleo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Terkay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Terkay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciryl_Gane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ciryl Gane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ngannou", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ngannou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Joshua", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Joshua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Bader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_Fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MMA Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chandler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Chandler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/08/06234517/lrg230515697388_PFL_LA-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798029", "eventUri": "eng-9798029", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-19", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 177}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

While a location is TBD at the moment, the rumor mill had stated that this event would be going down in Saudi Arabia. The main event will feature the highly anticipated debut of the man who was the biggest signing in PFL history.\n\nFormer UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou (17-3) will return to MMA to take on 2023 heavyweight champion Renan Ferreira (13-3, 3 NC). Earlier this year in the champions versus champions card, Ferreira took on and knocked out Bellator heavyweight champion Ryan Bader to earn this shot against Ngannou.\n\nIn the 2022 season, Ferreira had made the playoffs but fell short against eventual champion Ante Delija. Last season, he made up for it. He lost his first fight of the season, but that was overturned to a No Contest after his opponent popped for an illegal substance. From there, Ferreira took off.\n\nHe knocked out Matheus Scheffel in the first round to earn a spot in the playoffs. In the semifinals, he knocked out Maurice Greene in the first round to earn a shot against Denis Goltsov in the PFL World Championships. After a tough first round, Ferreira stormed back knocking out Goltsov to become champion. Then, he had his career-defining knockout win over Bader and now he takes on Francis Ngannou.\n\nFrancis Ngannou's UFC contract was up at the end of 2022. Once he was free to go wherever he wanted, he began negotiations with the PFL and ultimately signed with the promotion. One of the big things for Ngannou was having the ability to pursue boxing. While he signed with the promotion back in 2023, this October will mark his debut.\n\nLast October, he boxed former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury who was still a champion and undefeated at the time. Ngannou shocked the world by dropping Fury and going the distance. Personally, I had Ngannou winning, but he lost a razor close split decision against the man who was considered at the time to be the best boxer in the world at heavyweight.\n\nNgannou returned to the boxing ring earlier this year against former world champion Anthony Joshua. Unfortunately, this one didn't go nearly as well as Ngannou was knocked out cold in the second round. Now, he focuses back on the sport that made him a champion and he'll make his promotional debut against the baddest man that the PFL has to offer.", "source": {"uri": "empiresportsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire Sports Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_cunningham@empiresportsmedia.com", "name": "Daniel Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ngannou", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ngannou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bader", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Bader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_contest_(combat_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No contest (combat sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Joshua", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Joshua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://empiresportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PFL-Super-Fights-Ngannou-Ferreira.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798029", "eventUri": "eng-9798029", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-19", "textStart": 112, "textEnd": 124}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Following that fight, Ngannou eventually entered free agency where he signed with PFL but ultimately ended up taking a pair of boxing matches against Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua before scheduling his debut with the promotion in October.\n\nOverall, Ngannou has won his last six fights in a row including knockouts over former UFC heavyweight champions Stipe Miocic and Cain Velasquez during that run.\n\nAs for Ferreira, the 34-year-old Brazilian looks for by far the biggest win of his career after he's rattled off four straight wins in the PFL.

The two big men will compete for the newly minted PFL super fights championship belt. And in the co-feature, Cyborg (27-2 MMA, 0-0 PFL), also making a big splash with a promotional debut, is set to face Larissa Pacheco.\n\nThe event takes place Oct. 19 and airs live on pay-per-view, the promotion announced Wednesday. No location or venue was included in the announcement.\n\nNgannou is set for his first MMA fight since exiting the UFC in January 2022. The last fight on his contract was a successful title defense in a unanimous decision victory over Ciryl Gane at UFC 270.\n\nAfter negotiations with the UFC failed, Ngannou signed with the PFL, who granted him the freedom to compete in boxing. \"The Predator\" landed two marquee boxing matches against Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua. The fights were lucrative, but Ngannou lost bout bouts. He now returns to MMA, where he is a winner of six-straight fights, a streak that includes five finishes.\n\nFerreira (13-3 MMA, 7-1 PFL) was last in action in February at PFL vs. Bellator: Champions, where he quickly defeated Ryan Bader in just 21 seconds. Prior to that outing, he captured the 2023 PFL heavyweight championship by stopping Denis Goltsov in Round 2.\n\nCyborg last competed in MMA at Bellator 300, stopping Cat Zingano in the first round to defend her featherweight title.

The Cameroonian recently forayed into Hollywood again as a part of Zack Snyder's \"Rebel Moon\" where he plays the role of a gladiator. Naturally, fans soon drew parallels to McGregor's acting in \"Road House,\" with some claiming that Ngannou was the better of the two.\n\n\"Better acting than Connor Mcgregor for sure.\"\n\nWrote a fan after Snyder's sci-fi sequel, Rebel Moon, blew up on Netflix. In fact, the film is garnering positive responses all over the world, and 'The Predator's' cameo was certainly a delight for MMA fans. Others lauded Ngannou's effort and complimented the fighter for his second Hollywood gig with his first being a similar short scene from the Fast & the Furious franchise.\n\nMeanwhile, another user decided to use the opportunity to belittle the Irishman, essentially denouncing his antagonistic role in the movie \"Road House\" which was released earlier this year.\n\n\"He's better than McGregor.\"\n\n\"Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver\" is now available on Netflix. Charlie Hunnam, Anthony Hopkins Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, and Sofia Boutella all are starring in Zack Snyder's cinematic rendition where Francis takes the role of a chiseled gladiator.\n\nIn the meantime, the MMA athlete turned-boxer also revealed details about his much-awaited PFL debut.\n\nAfter racking up the heavyweight title in the biggest MMA promotion, 37-year-old Francis Ngannou now has his sights set on PFL. The pay disputes with the UFC finally forced the fighter to opt for other ventures, leaving his MMA career stagnant. Though he got two massive boxing bouts against Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, MMA fans have been yearning to see the behemoth in the cage.\n\nWell, even though an exact date is still pending, the Cameroonian provided an update on his hotly anticipated comeback to the octagon. During his conversation with Joe Rogan, Ngannou hinted October to be his return timeline.\n\n\"I will be fighting by the end of the year. That's what the PFL is working on [a fight in Saudi Arabia]. October, sometime. They're working on October. It's not finalized yet, but they were talking about October 19.

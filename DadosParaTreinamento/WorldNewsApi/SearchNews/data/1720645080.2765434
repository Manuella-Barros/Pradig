{"id": 231340294, "title": "Election campaign day 17: Rishi Sunak ducks media as D-Day row rumbles on", "text": "The Prime Minister avoided media questions amid continuing criticism over his early return from D-Day commemorations as the third weekend of campaigning got under way. Here are the key moments from day 17 of the campaign: \u2013 Putting up walls Mr Sunak visited a walled garden as an opportunity for reporters to quiz him did not take place, with the Tories citing time constraints on his tour of County Durham and North Yorkshire on Saturday. The planned \u201chuddle\u201d with journalists was called off as the D-Day row continued, and after his awkward exchange with broadcasters a day earlier. It came after another Cabinet minister \u2013 Mark Harper \u2013 said Mr Sunak had made a \u201cmistake\u201d by skipping an international ceremony attended by world leaders including US President Joe Biden to mark the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings. The Transport Secretary did not go as far as fellow senior Conservative Penny Mordaunt, who branded the decision \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d during Friday\u2019s BBC election debate. Mr Harper repeated Mr Sunak\u2019s suggestion it had always been his intention to leave before the event on Omaha Beach, even before he called the election. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \u201csuch a letdown for our whole country\u201d while Labour\u2019s Sir Keir Starmer stressed he felt it was his \u201cduty\u201d to thank veterans at the event Mr Sunak missed. \u2013 Brewing plans for small businesses Sir Keir was banging the drum for small firms on a campaign visit to a canal-side Camden brewery alongside Dragons\u2019 Den star Deborah Meaden. He promised an overhaul of the business rates system because \u201cthere\u2019s not a level playing field between businesses that are online and those that are sort of bricks and mortar\u201d. Meaden praised Labour\u2019s plan to set up Great British Energy, a publicly owned sustainable power company, as \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d. \u201cBusinesses don\u2019t like being out of control of costs, and energy is one of those costs that simply fluctuates beyond your control,\u201d the celebrity investor told the PA news agency. Sir Keir also told broadcasters there \u201cwon\u2019t be any surprises on tax\u201d in Labour\u2019s manifesto expected next week. After pulling the first pint of the day at 10.55am, the Labour leader joked that \u201cif all else fails\u201d he would be back at the north London brewery on July 5. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was also touting Labour\u2019s offer for growing businesses on the Farnborough high street with retail guru Mary Portas. Meanwhile, Labour\u2019s pledge to introduce an age cap of 80 on peers and axe new hereditary roles, as reported in The Times, got some flak after Sir Keir previously vowed to abolish the House of Lords. \u2013 Picture of the day \u2013 Davey campaigning is par for the course Staying true to his penchant for attention-grabbing photo ops, Sir Ed tried his hand at tennis in Newbury and played adventure golf in Wokingham. He visited the two Tory-held seats to promote the Lib Dems\u2019 proposal to plough \u00a350 million a year into creating three new national parks. He batted away accusations the Lib Dems are \u201cnimbys\u201d for focusing on parks amid a housing crisis and low economic growth. And after a round of mini golf on a dinosaur-themed course, Sir Ed said he would not put a figure on the number of seats he would consider a \u201cbad result\u201d because \u201cI don\u2019t like putting a ceiling on our ambitions\u201d. More lifelong Conservatives are going yellow, he said, noting that Mr Sunak\u2019s D-Day snub \u201creally cut through\u201d. \u201cThe veterans and their families are very upset and I think people who traditionally have thought the Conservatives are the party of patriotism no longer think that.\u201d \u2013 Salt from Swinney Mr Sunak was also getting blasted north of the border, where Scotland\u2019s First Minister John Swinney said his D-Day blunder \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d his credibility. The SNP leader also said his predecessor-but-one Nicola Sturgeon has a \u201chuge\u201d contribution to make in the party\u2019s General Election campaign. She has kept a relatively low profile amid a police probe into the spending of \u00a3600,000 of SNP funds. Mr Swinney would not be drawn on why his former boss had not been seen alongside him on the campaign trail so far, but told PA in Livingston: \u201cI welcome very much Nicola\u2019s contribution\u201d. \u2013 Quote of the day \u2013 Social media moment Poking fun at Sir Keir\u2019s supposed flip-flopping on policy, the Tories\u2019 TikTok account presented three versions of Barbie-like dolls dubbed \u201cRemain Keir\u201d, \u201cEco Keir\u201d and \u201cCorbyn Keir\u201d. Remain Keir comes with the captions \u201cwe want to campaign for Remain\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t want to diverge [from the EU]\u201d, while Eco Keir costs \u201conly \u00a338.5 billion\u201d, and Corbyn Keir \u201ccosts more\u201d. \u2013 What\u2019s happening tomorrow Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn are on the Sunday morning broadcast round. Sir Keir and Mr Swinney are expected to hit the campaign trail while Scottish Tory deputy leader Meghan Gallacher is out and about in Perthshire.", "summary": "The PM visited a walled garden as political opponents continued to bad-mouth his early return from Normandy.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-rishi-sunak-prime-minister-cameron-liberal-democrat-b1163086.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/17/604784f84ac2dd6be6f11c042420380aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTQ4ODU2-2.76451745.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:26:09", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "authors": ["Sophie Wingate"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.011}

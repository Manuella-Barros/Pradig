Hundreds of PTI workers and leaders were put behind bars for their alleged involvement in violence and attacks on military installations.\n\nDozens of the PTI leaders parted ways with the party or quit politics after the incident.\n\nDuring the protests, the miscreants targeted the civil and military installations including -- the Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi. The military had termed May 9 \"Black Day\" and decided to try the protesters under the Army Act.\n\nAlvi further said that their mandate was stolen in the February 8 general elections, adding that they had evidence about it.\n\nThe former ruling party believed that their mandate was stolen as PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan last week said: \"We won the 180 seats in the [February 8] elections. Our seats were given to other parties through Form 47.\"\n\nThe former president termed the PML-N-led coalition government a product of \"Form 47\".\n\nResponding to a question about the ISPR's presser, Alvi said: \"I also stated yesterday that the wrongdoer should ask for pardon, not the oppressed.\"\n\nDirector General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry Tuesday demanded \"those involved in the May 9 violent protests to apologise\" and shun politics of \"anarchy\" before holding any dialogue.\n\nCommenting on the presser, Alvi while speaking to the media outside the Punjab Assembly, emphasised the need for an impartial investigation into the May 9 incidents. \"The oppressor should seek forgiveness. Forgiveness is the only answer to all disputes.\"\n\n\"Those having real powers\" should initiate the dialogue process, he had reiterated.\n\nReferring to his party's alleged popularity among the masses, the former president said that \"a new logic of democracy is being presented\" by saying that \"70% people were wrong and a few people are right\".\n\nStressing the need for dialogues to steer the country out of political crisis Alvi said: \"[The establish] will have to talk to the people [PTI] having 70% mandate.\"\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Dr Ali has been trying to bridge the gap between the establishment and the PTI for a long.\n\nIn his maiden presser after leaving the Aiwan-e-Sadr in March, Alvi said: \"I tried to resolve things from every angle... Even now, I'm trying to resolve things.\"\n\nIn January 2023 too, Alvi offered to mediate between the Shehbaz Sharif-led then government and PTI to lower the rising political temperature in the country.\n\n\"I have tried to end such misunderstandings,\" Alvi had said\n\n\"Being the president, it is my responsibility to keep this federation together.

Hundreds of PTI workers and leaders were put behind bars for their alleged involvement in violence and attacks on military installations.\n\nDozens of the PTI leaders parted ways with the party or quit politics after the incident.\n\nDuring the protests, the miscreants targeted the civil and military installations including -- the Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi. The military had termed May 9 \"Black Day\" and decided to try the protesters under the Army Act.\n\nAlvi further said that their mandate was stolen in the February 8 general elections, adding that they had evidence about it.\n\nThe former ruling party believed that their mandate was stolen as PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan last week said: \"We won the 180 seats in the [February 8] elections. Our seats were given to other parties through Form 47.\"\n\nThe former president termed the PML-N-led coalition government a product of \"Form 47\".\n\nResponding to a question about the ISPR's presser, Alvi said: \"I also stated yesterday that the wrongdoer should ask for pardon, not the oppressed.\"\n\nDirector General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry Tuesday demanded \"those involved in the May 9 violent protests to apologise\" and shun politics of \"anarchy\" before holding any dialogue.\n\nCommenting on the presser, Alvi while speaking to the media outside the Punjab Assembly, emphasised the need for an impartial investigation into the May 9 incidents. \"The oppressor should seek forgiveness. Forgiveness is the only answer to all disputes.\"\n\n\"Those having real powers\" should initiate the dialogue process, he had reiterated.\n\nReferring to his party's alleged popularity among the masses, the former president said that \"a new logic of democracy is being presented\" by saying that \"70% people were wrong and a few people are right\".\n\nStressing the need for dialogues to steer the country out of political crisis Alvi said: \"[The establish] will have to talk to the people [PTI] having 70% mandate.\"", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arif_Alvi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arif Alvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Ayub_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omar Ayub Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Headquarters_(Pakistan_Army)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaudhry_Ahmed_Sharif_Gujjar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chaudhry Ahmed Sharif Gujjar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Pakistani_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1988 Pakistani general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_Assembly_of_the_Punjab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provincial Assembly of the Punjab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-05-09/l_543239_073914_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553778", "eventUri": "eng-9553778", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 431, "textEnd": 436, "freq": 7}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-08", "textStart": 1952, "textEnd": 1962, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I was a little star-struck but played it cool and He said he was too!'\n\nThe retired athlete's organization, Derrick Brooks Charities, once used a Scientology program for a mentoring event on human rights for young women that held at the Scientology-affiliated United for Human Rights in Clearwater, Florida, also the base for the church's global HQ.\n\nAnd in 2016, the nonprofit celebrated UNICEF's International Day of the Girl at the church's religious retreat in Clearwater called Fort Harrison, which was publicized on the Scientology website.\n\nThe rare group photo also suggests Cruise's eldest daughter Isabella has been spending time in Clearwater. She has not been seen at her home in Croydon, England in months.\n\nThe actor's close bond with his adult children is a far cry from the relationship he shares with his biological daughter, Suri, who turned 18 last month, and is reported to be estranged from her dad for well over a decade\n\nIt has been suggested that the church of Scientology may be the reason for the distance between Cruise and his younger daughter following his divorce from Katie Holmes in 2012\n\nThe Hollywood star (pictured in 2008) has maintained a close relationship with Connor and Isabella - who were raised in the Church of Scientology - through their youth and into adulthood following his divorce from Kidman in 2001\n\nCruise and Kidman adopted Connor and Isabella in the early 1990s after Nicole suffered an ectopic pregnancy and a miscarriage - and was told as a result she might find it hard to conceive.\n\nThe exes agreed to joint custody after their 11-year marriage ended in divorce, but behind closed doors, the kids reportedly remained 'loyal to their father' and decided to live with him, and were subsequently raised in the controversial church of Scientology.\n\nNicole, now 56, hasn't been pictured publicly with her eldest two children since 2007, and she was reportedly left 'devastated' after the pair didn't attend her father's funeral in 2014.\n\nBoth of her adult children were also notably absent last weekend when she proudly appeared on the red carpet with her husband Keith Urban and their daughters to accept a lifetime achievement award from American Film Institute at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nWhile Connor, who is believed to be 'extremely loyal to his dad', didn't appear to show Nicole any public support for her achievement, daughter Bella did like one of her mother's Instagram posts celebrating the award.\n\nOverall, the Kidman Cruise kids live relatively low-key lives - but Connor in particular is seen with his father frequently, supporting him on promotional tours all around the world.\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE magazine he lives a 'simple' existence, saying: 'He lives in his own home in a Scientology community. His life is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.'\n\nConnor seems to be very passionate about deep sea fishing and often posts photos on his Instagram account proudly holding up his catch of the day on boats.\n\nIn 2016, Connor told PEOPLE he and his parents went fishing frequently when he was growing up, saying, 'I was blessed to travel the world as a young kid and now I'm traveling the world working.'\n\nAmong Connor's other hobbies are golf, and he appears to enjoy days out on the course with his friends, according to his Instagram profile.\n\nBella Kidman Cruise, 31, has been based in London for most of her adult life. She 'liked' a post celebrating her mother's accolade on Instagram\n\nNicole, now 56, hasn't been pictured publicly with her eldest two children since 2007\n\nAs Nicole Kidman received an American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award this weekend, she appeared on the red carpet with the daughters she shares with Keith Urban, Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith Margaret, 13\n\nKidman and Urban, 56, have been married since 2006 and share two daughters, Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith Margaret, 13, who made their red carpet debut at last week's event.\n\nDespite a reported rift between Kidman and her oldest children - something Connor and Bella deny - the actress has previously spoken of her 'unconditional' love for them.\n\nAccording to her website, Isabella hasn't updated her online art business, Bella Kidman Cruise, since September - and her last photo shared on Instagram was from Clearwater.\n\nHer voting record in the US states that she is living in the same condominium as her father, a luxury building called The Skyview, which is home to high-ranking Scientologists, who are known to donate millions to the church.\n\nConnor is also registered at the same condo and has been living in Clearwater since his father uprooted from Los Angeles in 2016, selling his two LA properties for $51million.\n\nTom owns five units in The Skyview including the double-floored penthouse - and sold another fifth-floor pad for $525,000 to Mexican Scientologist, Mike Moiseb, in May last year.\n\nPublic records show that Tom has spent over $3million revamping his penthouse - on top of the $9.5million he paid for it.\n\nThe renovations include $1.75million on handmade interior fittings made by specialists Mortensen Woodwork, $416,650 to Craftsmanship Installations for designer furniture, $51,400 on the cleaners A and A Clean Up Inc, $299,422 for smart windows from Tab Glass Window and Corp and $261,326 on painting with Five Arrows.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com",

Alongside Connor was his sister, Lee Ann, marking a familial show of support for Tom's cinematic ventures.\n\nCurrently residing in Florida, Connor has chosen to stay close to Tom following the high-profile divorce from Nicole in 2001.\n\nHe and his sister, Isabella, aged 31, were both raised within the Church of Scientology -- a faith from which Nicole distanced herself post-divorce.\n\nThis upbringing appears to have influenced the siblings' current relationship with their mother; they haven't been publicly seen with Nicole since 2007, suggesting a complex family dynamic.\n\nDespite the potential rift, Connor leads a relatively discreet life, away from the high-wattage glare of Hollywood.\n\nResiding within a Scientology community in Clearwater, Florida, he immerses himself in hobbies like deep-sea fishing -- a passion frequently showcased on his Instagram with proud displays of his catches.\n\nConnor's upbringing was peppered with travel and outdoor activities, as he reminisced in a 2016 interview with PEOPLE about the frequent fishing trips with his parents.\n\n\"My family means everything,\" Connor said, reflecting his deep-seated values. This close-knit bond is visible as he accompanies his father across the globe for various film promotions, maintaining a solid father-son relationship despite his low-key lifestyle.\n\nConnor's interests aren't confined to the sea; he is also an avid golfer and a culinary enthusiast.\n\nIn 2021, he launched an Instagram account, Connor's Meat Shack, where he shares his barbeque exploits, specializing in everything from wagyu to brisket. Although the account had a hiatus, Connor reassured his followers recently that he is still passionate about cooking, posting an appetizing photo of BBQ ribs.\n\nDespite his understated existence, Connor's presence alongside Tom at public events, like the Mission Impossible film promotions, underscores the strong bond between them.\n\nAt one such event in July 2023, Connor, dressed in casual attire, was seen with his aunt, Lee Ann Mapother. Their appearance highlighted the supportive family backdrop that defines Tom's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Connor remains connected with his sister, Bella, who lives in London with her husband. He affectionately shares throwback photos of them on Instagram, describing them as \"Day One homies.\"\n\nNicole Kidman's relationship with Connor Cruise\n\nThe narrative of Connor and Bella's relationship with their mother, Nicole, is tinged with complexity.\n\nWhile Nicole was not present at Connor's 2019 wedding to Silvia Zanchi -- a Scientology ceremony -- rumors swirled about the alleged restrictions due to Nicole's supposed status as a \"suppressive person\" within Scientology.\n\nThese rumors were fueled by insights from former Scientology insiders, who suggested that the church's policies might have strained familial ties.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nicole has spoken about her unconditional love for both Connor and Bella, respecting their life choices and their commitment to Scientology. This maternal affection shines through, even if publicly, the family seems fragmented.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faye_james@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Faye James", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Kidman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Church of Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isabella I of Castile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressive_Person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suppressive Person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/d5dea9f8588e-rs1200x1200-210202174419-1200-tom-cruise-connor-cruise-mp.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541998", "eventUri": "eng-9541998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

I was a little star-struck but played it cool and He said he was too!'\n\nThe retired athlete's organization, Derrick Brooks Charities, once used a Scientology program for a mentoring event on human rights for young women that held at the Scientology-affiliated United for Human Rights in Clearwater, Florida, also the base for the church's global HQ.\n\nAnd in 2016, the nonprofit celebrated UNICEF's International Day of the Girl at the church's religious retreat in Clearwater called Fort Harrison, which was publicized on the Scientology website.\n\nThe rare group photo also suggests Cruise's eldest daughter Isabella has been spending time in Clearwater. She has not been seen at her home in Croydon, England in months.\n\nThe actor's close bond with his adult children is a far cry from the relationship he shares with his biological daughter, Suri, who turned 18 last month, and is reported to be estranged from her dad for well over a decade\n\nIt has been suggested that the church of Scientology may be the reason for the distance between Cruise and his younger daughter following his divorce from Katie Holmes in 2012\n\nThe Hollywood star (pictured in 2008) has maintained a close relationship with Connor and Isabella - who were raised in the Church of Scientology - through their youth and into adulthood following his divorce from Kidman in 2001\n\nCruise and Kidman adopted Connor and Isabella in the early 1990s after Nicole suffered an ectopic pregnancy and a miscarriage - and was told as a result she might find it hard to conceive.\n\nThe exes agreed to joint custody after their 11-year marriage ended in divorce, but behind closed doors, the kids reportedly remained 'loyal to their father' and decided to live with him, and were subsequently raised in the controversial church of Scientology.\n\nNicole, now 56, hasn't been pictured publicly with her eldest two children since 2007, and she was reportedly left 'devastated' after the pair didn't attend her father's funeral in 2014.\n\nBoth of her adult children were also notably absent last weekend when she proudly appeared on the red carpet with her husband Keith Urban and their daughters to accept a lifetime achievement award from American Film Institute at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nWhile Connor, who is believed to be 'extremely loyal to his dad', didn't appear to show Nicole any public support for her achievement, daughter Bella did like one of her mother's Instagram posts celebrating the award.\n\nOverall, the Kidman Cruise kids live relatively low-key lives - but Connor in particular is seen with his father frequently, supporting him on promotional tours all around the world.\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE magazine he lives a 'simple' existence, saying: 'He lives in his own home in a Scientology community. His life is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.'\n\nConnor seems to be very passionate about deep sea fishing and often posts photos on his Instagram account proudly holding up his catch of the day on boats.\n\nIn 2016, Connor told PEOPLE he and his parents went fishing frequently when he was growing up, saying, 'I was blessed to travel the world as a young kid and now I'm traveling the world working.'\n\nAmong Connor's other hobbies are golf, and he appears to enjoy days out on the course with his friends, according to his Instagram profile.\n\nBella Kidman Cruise, 31, has been based in London for most of her adult life. She 'liked' a post celebrating her mother's accolade on Instagram\n\nNicole, now 56, hasn't been pictured publicly with her eldest two children since 2007\n\nAs Nicole Kidman received an American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award this weekend, she appeared on the red carpet with the daughters she shares with Keith Urban, Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith Margaret, 13\n\nKidman and Urban, 56, have been married since 2006 and share two daughters, Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith Margaret, 13, who made their red carpet debut at last week's event.\n\nDespite a reported rift between Kidman and her oldest children - something Connor and Bella deny - the actress has previously spoken of her 'unconditional' love for them.\n\nAccording to her website, Isabella hasn't updated her online art business, Bella Kidman Cruise, since September - and her last photo shared on Instagram was from Clearwater.\n\nHer voting record in the US states that she is living in the same condominium as her father, a luxury building called The Skyview, which is home to high-ranking Scientologists, who are known to donate millions to the church.\n\nConnor is also registered at the same condo and has been living in Clearwater since his father uprooted from Los Angeles in 2016, selling his two LA properties for $51million.\n\nTom owns five units in The Skyview including the double-floored penthouse - and sold another fifth-floor pad for $525,000 to Mexican Scientologist, Mike Moiseb, in May last year.\n\nPublic records show that Tom has spent over $3million revamping his penthouse - on top of the $9.5million he paid for it.\n\nThe renovations include $1.75million on handmade interior fittings made by specialists Mortensen Woodwork, $416,650 to Craftsmanship Installations for designer furniture, $51,400 on the cleaners A and A Clean Up Inc, $299,422 for smart windows from Tab Glass Window and Corp and $261,326 on painting with Five Arrows.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

After struggling to conceive, the former couple adopted daughter Isabella in 1992 and son Connor in 1995.\n\nAfter his first marriage broke down, the actor found love again with Katie Holmes and the pair went on to welcome his only biological child, Suri, who celebrated her 18th birthday last month. Tom missed the celebrations and insiders said he feels \"guilty\" about it, despite reports claiming he has not been involved in Suri's life for several years.\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Cruise rides motorcycle for Mission Impossible after ditching daughter Suri's 18th birthday\n\nConnor enjoys fishing and shares photos of his catches on Instagram Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman adopted their children Connor and Isabella\n\nTom's two adopted children, however, are said to have a good relationship with the actor, who raised them within the controversial Church of Scientology. Reports claim the siblings have a rift with their mother as they have not been seen in public with Kidman since 2007.\n\nWhile Isabella lives in London with her IT manager husband, Connor is based in a Scientology community in Clearwater, Florida, and spends much time with his father, supporting him on promotional tours all around the world.\n\nA source previously said Connor enjoys cooking, fishing and has a lot of friends. They told People: \"Connor has a pretty simple life in Clearwater. He lives in his own home in a Scientology community. His life is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.\"\n\nHe also enjoys cooking and has an account dedicated to his meat dishes Connor Cruise performed at The Pool After Dark at Harrah's Resort\n\nConnor often posts photos of his catches during fishing trips and also runs an Instagram profile showing off slow-cooked joints of meat he enjoys cooking. According to his Instagram profile, he also enjoys golfing and enjoys days out on the course with his friends.\n\nApart from living a simple life in Florida, Connor is often spotted in public with his father Tom. Last summer he was also seen in New York with his aunt Lee Ann as they supported Tom during the promotional tour for the latest Mission Impossible film. Sources say Connor is \"incredibly loyal\" to his father and is also close to his sister Isabella, once describing their relationship as \"Day One homies\".\n\nTom Cruise and his son have a close bond\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week Tom's youngest daughter Suri looked all grown up as she stepped out for a springtime stroll in New York City shortly after her famous father ditched her 18th birthday. The soon-to-be high school grad was seen focused on her music as she went for a stroll in the city after just wrapping up her birthday celebrations.\n\nSuri looked comfy and cute for the daytime outing as she stepped out in a cream, tight long-sleeved top with a pair of tight black shorts. She added a touch of colour to the neutral look with a pair of fun pink patterned socks and a bright palm frond-covered tote.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Tom Cruise's representative for comment.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Kidman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Church of Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_(cannabis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint (cannabis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32736021.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_CONNOR-MAIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541998", "eventUri": "eng-9541998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Per the Mirror, Connor is reportedly \"incredibly loyal\" to his father, despite his siblings not only being private but not super close with their dad.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nConnor and Cruise have been seen out together numerous times over the years, making more appearances for him than his other two siblings.\n\nNow, does Connor live close to his dad? Not exactly. While Cruise has been in London filming the Mission Impossible movies, and has his daughter Bella close by since she's there with her husband, Connor lives in Clearwater, Florida. But he lives within a Scientology community, so he has that in common with his close dad, too.\n\nSo, while they have an ocean between them, inside sources have said time and time again that Connor is incredibly loyal to his A-list pa.\n\nFor those who don't know, in 1992, Nicole Kidman and Cruise adopted a daughter named Isabella Jane and in 1995, they adopted a son named Connor.\n\nCruise also welcomed a daughter with his ex-wife Katie Holmes named Suri, who recently turned 18 and with whom he's reportedly estranged.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "delilah_gray@yahoo.com", "name": "Delilah Gray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Kidman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living_Aboard", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living Aboard", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CyYWauXo_Gh.ObzFmDARkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sheknows_79/f7a90a553337ca7c409524f730a312b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541998", "eventUri": "eng-9541998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

But what about his eldest children, Connor, 29, and Bella, 31, who he shares with ex Nicole Kidman? Despite their private nature, a rare photo of Cruise with Bella and Conner sheds some light on their bond.\n\nFormer NFL player Derrick Brooks posted an iconic snap on Instagram of Cruise and his kids at a hockey game last December. The trio (joined by Brooks and others) saw the Tampa Bay Lightning face off against the Florida Panthers. \"Good Evening, Wow, look who stopped by my office before our @tblightning game tonight!\" Brooks captioned the post. \"@tomcruise. I was a little star struck but played it cool and He said he was too! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\"\n\nCruise has his arm around Brooks at the front of the group photo, with Connor standing on Brooks' other side, dressed in a white t-shirt and blue vest over jeans. Bella can be seen smiling in the background, surrounded by several other people.\n\nThis is the first time Cruise has posed for a photo with Connor and Bella since 2009, per E! News. At that time, they had attended a soccer game in Los Angeles. Connor has also been photographed with his famous dad throughout the years, mostly at sporting events for the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Maryland Terrapins.\n\nIt appears that Bella and Connor's relationship with their dad is better than ever -- and that they all three share a love of sports. This is a sharp contrast to their relationship with their mom, who they haven't been seen in public with since 2007, per Daily Mail. Bella and Connor were raised in the Church of Scientology, which Kidman is no longer a part of.\n\nAn insider told PEOPLE in 2018 that Connor lives in Florida. \"Connor has a pretty simple life in Clearwater,\" they said. \"He lives in his own home in a Scientology community. His life is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.\"\n\nBella is more into fashion. She got her start at Holmes and Yang (the fashion line of Katie Holmes) selling t-shirts adorned with her own drawings, per PEOPLE.\n\nThe Big Little Lies star, who was married to Cruise from 1990-2001, has occasionally spoken about her relationship with her eldest children. She told The Sun in 2019, per Hello! Magazine, \"Motherhood is about the journey. There are going to be incredible peaks and valleys, whether you are an adopting mother or a birth mother. What a child needs is love. They have made choices to be Scientologists. It's our job as a parent to always offer unconditional love.\"\n\nKidman is also mom to daughters Sunday, 15, and Faith, 13, with husband Keith Urban. The girls recently made their red carpet debut at the 49 AFI Life Achievement Award Gala last month, where their mom was being honored for her decades of contributions to the film industry.\n\n\"I have a very full life with people that I love,\" she told Elle in March. \"I'm raising daughters. I'm a wife, I'm a best friend. I'm a sister, I'm an aunt. I have deeply intimate relationships with people. And that, to me, is the meaning of life -- and then taking care of what we leave behind, who we leave behind and how we do that, and our sense of respect for that.\"", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydni_ellis@sheknows.com", "name": "Sydni Ellis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Katie Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Kidman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Church of Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E!

(Cruise is also dad of 18-year-old Suri, whom he shares with ex-wife Katie Holmes.)

I was a little star-struck but played it cool and He said he was too!,\" he captioned.\n\nEarlier, reports were making rounds Nicole wanted her kids to be at the 49th AFI Lifetime Achievement Award event but reportedly it did not work out.\n\nIn light of these reports, it was suggested the children are closer to Tom than their Oscar-winner mother.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Church of Scientology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Kidman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Film Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifetime_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lifetime (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Lighting", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Lighting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-05-07/l_542809_121007_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541998", "eventUri": "eng-9541998", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-28", "textStart": 486, "textEnd": 497}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 452726344, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 14, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 14}}}

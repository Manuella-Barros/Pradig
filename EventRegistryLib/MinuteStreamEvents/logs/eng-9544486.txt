More than 40 people were eventually arrested and loaded into a sheriff's department bus to be taken to a jail for processing on suspicion of what police called conspiracy to commit burglary.\n\nAmong those arrested were a pair of journalists -- William Gude and Sean Beckner-Carmitchel -- prompting quick criticism from media organizations. Ashanti Blaize-Hopkins, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, wrote on X, \"Both campus media journalists and external journalists must be allowed to cover these protests without law enforcement interference.\"\n\nShe called the arrests of the journalists \"a clear violation of both the First Amendment\" and California law.\n\nOrganizers of the protests at UCLA posted on social media Monday morning that the early morning arrests were illegal and \"a continuation of the consistent repression of student activism and the increase of militarization of universities.\" The group said protesters \"refuse to conduct business as usual\" until the university meets demands for divestment from Israel and Israeli-tied businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, 50 or more protesters gathered around 7 a.m. inside the campus' Moore Hall, staging an apparent sit-in. KCAL9 reported that the crowd had dispersed from the building by 9 a.m., but reports of other unauthorized gatherings began materializing in other buildings.\n\nBy late-morning, a crowd of more than 100 people marched through the campus, pausing for a rally outside the student activity center.\n\nThe continued protests prompted the university to send out an alert shortly after 10 a.m. announcing that classes were again being pushed to remote.\n\n\"Law enforcement is stationed around campus to help promote safety and actively monitor conditions,\" according to the alert. \"Student Affairs has staff on campus to support our students. The hospital and health system, other clinical operations, and housing and hospitality facilities remain open. Law School exams will continue as scheduled. UCLA Extension classes scheduled to be held in person in any Westwood or UCLA campus location have been moved to live-online format.\"\n\nLater Monday afternoon, the university announced that \"due to ongoing disruption,\" the campus will remain under limited operations, and classes will remain remote for the rest of the week.\n\nOn Sunday, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block announced the creation of an Office of Campus Safety to administer policing and emergency management in the aftermath of campus unrest over pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nThe school came under heavy criticism for its response to violence that broke out at the protest encampment last week, with Gov. Gavin Newsom and other elected officials calling for investigations into the university's reaction, and some critics even calling on Block to resign ahead of his previously announced plan to step down on July 31.\n\n\"In the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community,\" Block said in a message to the UCLA community Sunday. \"In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes. But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations.\n\n\"I am therefore taking several actions to significantly alter our campus safety structure. ... Effective immediately, I am moving oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety, whose leader reports directly to me. It is clear that UCLA needs a unit and leader whose sole responsibility is campus safety to guide us through tense times. This organizational structure, which elevates our safety and emergency management operations, has proven to be an effective one at other major universities across the country.\"\n\nLeading the new office as its inaugural associate vice chancellor will be Rick Braziel, who'll bring more than 30 years of public safety service to the job, including five years as chief of police for the city of Sacramento. Braziel has also served as an instructor in community policing and has led reviews of law enforcement agencies and police responses.\n\nBlock also created a formal advisory group whose members include UC Davis Chief of Police and Coordinator of the Council of UC Chiefs of Police Joe Farrow, professor of psychology and of health policy and management Vickie Mays and UC Office of the President Systemwide Director of Community Safety Jody Stiger.\n\n\"I am confident that AVC Braziel, in partnership with this advisory group, will provide effective new leadership of our safety and emergency management operations,\" Block said.\n\nPolice moved in and cleared the weeklong pro-Palestinian encampment early Thursday, arresting 209 people. Most of those arrested were booked on suspicion of unlawful assembly, then released from custody with instructions to appear in court at a later date.\n\nNo significant injuries to protesters or the hundreds of police officers who took part in the raid were reported. It was unclear how many of them were actually UCLA students.\n\nDisputes between protesters at the encampment peaked overnight last Tuesday and early Wednesday, when the pro-Palestinian encampment was attacked by counter-protesters supporting Israel who set of fireworks and allegedly deployed pepper spray or bear repellent. The violence prompted a cancellation of all classed at UCLA last Wednesday.\n\n\"We approached the encampment with the goal of maximizing our community members' ability to make their voices heard on an urgent global issue,\" Block said in a statement Thursday afternoon. \"We had allowed it to remain in place so long as it did not jeopardize Bruins' safety or harm our ability to carry out our mission.\n\n\"But while many of the protesters at the encampment remained peaceful, ultimately, the site became a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption to our campus. Several days of violent clashes between demonstrators and counter-demonstrators put too many Bruins in harm's way and created an environment that was completely unsafe for learning.\"\n\nThe clearing of the encampment, however, gave a broader picture of the amount of damage done to the campus. The front of Royce Hall and Powell Library suffered extensive graffiti damage, some of it profane. Piles of garbage were also left behind in the former encampment area.\n\nThe school's much-criticized response to the violence remained a point of contention this weekend. On Saturday, more than 20 UCLA faculty members and community activists rallied at the Hammer Museum to call for the resignation of Block, the Daily Bruin reported.\n\nOn May 23, Block is expected to testify before Congress about UCLA's response to antisemitism on the campus and actions to protect Jewish students.\n\nMeanwhile, the union that represents campus police officers at the 10 University of California schools blamed UCLA administrators for the delayed response to Tuesday's fights and other violence between counter-protesters and people at the pro-Palestinian encampment.\n\nFederated University Police Officers' Association said Saturday that the probe by UC President Michael Drake into the university's \"planning, actions and response by law enforcement\" must consider the UC's own guidelines for response to campus protests.\n\n\"The written guidelines for roles and responsibilities make clear that senior UC administrators on each campus are solely responsible for the University's response to campus protests; those administrators decide the objective, and campus police are only responsible for tactics in implementing those objectives,\" FUPOA President Wade Stern said.\n\n\"As such, the UCLA administration owns all the fallout from the response and lack of response to this protest.\"\n\nThere was no response Saturday to emails sent to UCLA and Drake's office seeking comment.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom and other elected officials called for investigations into the university and police response. Observers said the Tuesday night attack was allowed to rage for several hours with little to no police intervention, until officers in riot gear finally moved in around 3 a.m. and restored order.\n\nOrganizers of the UCLA Palestine Solidarity Encampment, similar to their counterparts at USC, have issued a list of demands calling for divestment of all University of California and UCLA Foundation funds from companies tied to Israel, along with a demand that the university call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and begin an academic boycott against Israeli universities, including a suspension of study-abroad programs.\n\nThe UC issued a statement in response noting that the university has \"consistently opposed calls for boycott against and divestment from Israel. While the university affirms the right of our community members to express diverse viewpoints, a boycott of this sort impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses.\n\n\"UC tuition and fees are the primary funding sources for the University's core operations. None of these funds are used for investment purposes,\" the statement continued.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

More than 40 people were eventually arrested and loaded into a sheriff's department bus to be taken to a jail for processing on suspicion of what police called conspiracy to commit burglary.\n\nAmong those arrested were a pair of journalists -- William Gude and Sean Beckner-Carmitchel -- prompting quick criticism from media organizations. Ashanti Blaize-Hopkins, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, posted on social media, \"Both campus media journalists and external journalists must be allowed to cover these protests without law enforcement interference.\"\n\nShe called the arrests of the journalists \"a clear violation of both the First Amendment\" and California law.\n\nOrganizers of the protests at UCLA posted on social media Monday morning that the early morning arrests were illegal and \"a continuation of the consistent repression of student activism and the increase of militarization of universities.\" The group said protesters \"refuse to conduct business as usual\" until the university meets demands for divestment from Israel and Israeli-tied businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, 50 or more protesters gathered around 7 a.m. inside the campus' Moore Hall, staging an apparent sit-in. KCAL9 reported that the crowd had dispersed from the building by 9 a.m., but reports of other unauthorized gatherings began materializing in other buildings.\n\nBy late-morning, a crowd of more than 100 people marched through the campus, pausing for a rally outside the student activity center.\n\nThe continued protests prompted the university to send out an alert shortly after 10 a.m. announcing that classes were again being pushed to remote.\n\n\"Law enforcement is stationed around campus to help promote safety and actively monitor conditions,\" according to the alert. \"Student Affairs has staff on campus to support our students. The hospital and health system, other clinical operations, and housing and hospitality facilities remain open. Law School exams will continue as scheduled. UCLA Extension classes scheduled to be held in person in any Westwood or UCLA campus location have been moved to live-online format.\"\n\nLater Monday afternoon, the university announced that \"due to ongoing disruption,\" the campus will remain under limited operations, and classes will remain remote for the rest of the week.\n\nOn Sunday, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block announced the creation of an Office of Campus Safety to administer policing and emergency management in the aftermath of campus unrest over pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nThe school came under heavy criticism for its response to violence that broke out at the protest encampment last week, with Gov. Gavin Newsom and other elected officials calling for investigations into the university's reaction, and some critics even calling on Block to resign ahead of his previously announced plan to step down on July 31.\n\n\"In the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community,\" Block said in a message to the UCLA community Sunday. \"In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes. But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations.\n\n\"I am therefore taking several actions to significantly alter our campus safety structure. ... Effective immediately, I am moving oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety, whose leader reports directly to me. It is clear that UCLA needs a unit and leader whose sole responsibility is campus safety to guide us through tense times. This organizational structure, which elevates our safety and emergency management operations, has proven to be an effective one at other major universities across the country.\"\n\nLeading the new office as its inaugural associate vice chancellor will be Rick Braziel, who'll bring more than 30 years of public safety service to the job, including five years as chief of police for the city of Sacramento. Braziel has also served as an instructor in community policing and has led reviews of law enforcement agencies and police responses.\n\nBlock also created a formal advisory group whose members include UC Davis Chief of Police and Coordinator of the Council of UC Chiefs of Police Joe Farrow, professor of psychology and of health policy and management Vickie Mays and UC Office of the President Systemwide Director of Community Safety Jody Stiger.\n\n\"I am confident that AVC Braziel, in partnership with this advisory group, will provide effective new leadership of our safety and emergency management operations,\" Block said.\n\nPolice moved in and cleared the weeklong pro-Palestinian encampment early Thursday, arresting 209 people. Most of those arrested were booked on suspicion of unlawful assembly, then released from custody with instructions to appear in court at a later date.\n\nNo significant injuries to protesters or the hundreds of police officers who took part in the raid were reported. It was unclear how many of them were actually UCLA students.\n\nDisputes between protesters at the encampment peaked overnight last Tuesday and early Wednesday, when the pro-Palestinian encampment was attacked by counter-protesters supporting Israel who set of fireworks and allegedly deployed pepper spray or bear repellent. The violence prompted a cancellation of all classed at UCLA last Wednesday.\n\n\"We approached the encampment with the goal of maximizing our community members' ability to make their voices heard on an urgent global issue,\" Block said in a statement Thursday afternoon. \"We had allowed it to remain in place so long as it did not jeopardize Bruins' safety or harm our ability to carry out our mission.\n\n\"But while many of the protesters at the encampment remained peaceful, ultimately, the site became a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption to our campus. Several days of violent clashes between demonstrators and counter-demonstrators put too many Bruins in harm's way and created an environment that was completely unsafe for learning.\"\n\nThe clearing of the encampment, however, gave a broader picture of the amount of damage done to the campus. The front of Royce Hall and Powell Library suffered extensive graffiti damage, some of it profane. Piles of garbage were also left behind in the former encampment area.\n\nThe school's much-criticized response to the violence remained a point of contention this weekend. On Saturday, more than 20 UCLA faculty members and community activists rallied at the Hammer Museum to call for the resignation of Block, the Daily Bruin reported.\n\nOn May 23, Block is expected to testify before Congress about UCLA's response to antisemitism on the campus and actions to protect Jewish students.\n\nMeanwhile, the union that represents campus police officers at the 10 University of California schools blamed UCLA administrators for the delayed response to Tuesday's fights and other violence between counter-protesters and people at the pro-Palestinian encampment.\n\nFederated University Police Officers' Association said Saturday that the probe by UC President Michael Drake into the university's \"planning, actions and response by law enforcement\" must consider the UC's own guidelines for response to campus protests.\n\n\"The written guidelines for roles and responsibilities make clear that senior UC administrators on each campus are solely responsible for the University's response to campus protests; those administrators decide the objective, and campus police are only responsible for tactics in implementing those objectives,\" FUPOA President Wade Stern said.\n\n\"As such, the UCLA administration owns all the fallout from the response and lack of response to this protest.\"\n\nThere was no response Saturday to emails sent to UCLA and Drake's office seeking comment.\n\nNewsom and other elected officials called for investigations into the university and police response.

Protesters established a Palestinian solidarity encampment in the center of campus last month.\n\nLast weekend the university saw clashes after thousands of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators gathered at UCLA. Days later, a masked group of people marched on campus and assaulted pro-Palestinian demonstrators as law enforcement and campus security watched on. The violence shook students and prompted the university to cancel classes on Wednesday. Police dismantled the pro-Palestinian encampment shortly after and arrested hundreds of people.\n\nPolice and the university had faced condemnation for their response to the violent attack on demonstrators, including from the California governor, who called it \"unacceptable\". The UCLA police chief rejected the criticism, telling the Los Angeles Times he did everything he could, while a union for UC police departments said the blame fell on administrators.\n\nBlock announced that Rick Braziel, who previously worked as the police chief in Sacramento, would lead the new office at UCLA. Braziel has served on teams reviewing law enforcement responses in high-profile incidents, including in the Uvalde school shooting in Texas.\n\nAn advisory group with members that include law enforcement, a professor and a UC official in charge of community safety will \"partner\" with Braziel, according to Block's statement. UCLA and the UC office of the president will investigate the campus's security processes.\n\n\"These actions are essential for creating a secure environment where everyone at UCLA can confidently pursue their studies and careers,\" Block said.\n\nAlthough the encampment at UCLA has been dismantled, unrest continues. Police detained dozens of people at a university parking garage on Monday morning. The campus police department told the Daily Bruin, UCLA's student newspaper, that officers arrested 43 people on charges of conspiracy to commit burglary. Journalists and legal observers were reportedly among those arrested. Pro-Palestinian students held a demonstration and sit-in on campus later Monday.\n\nUCLA's office of emergency management sent an alert out on social media at about 4pm, saying that \"due to ongoing disruption\" all classes would be held remotely through 10 May. Royce Hall and Powell Library will be closed through 10 May as well, and students and staff were advised to avoid the area.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

On Thursday, while police were making arrests, rubber bullets were shot at certain unruly demonstrators.\n\nBlock declared on Sunday in a message to students that \"urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations,\" and that he is conducting a \"thorough investigation of our security processes.\"\n\nHe also noted that emergency response and campus police will come under the scope of the newly established Office of Public Safety. Rick Braziel, a former chief of police in Sacramento, will be leading the office.\n\nAdditionally, the university announced that Monday is the first day of in-session classes, as opposed to remote classes, following the protests that caused all of last week's classes to be canceled.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol claimed that last week, more than 200 UCLA students were taken into custody.\n\nChancellor Gene Block then sent the following message to the campus community, which reads:\n\n\"Dear Bruin Community: Protecting the safety of our community underpins everything we do at UCLA. Our students, faculty and staff can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure.\n\nIn the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community. In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes. But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations.\n\nI am therefore taking several actions to significantly alter our campus safety structure. These decisions were not made lightly -- but my leadership team and I feel that decisive change is needed to help maintain a safe campus environment.\n\nEffective immediately, I am moving oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety, whose leader reports directly to me. It is clear that UCLA needs a unit and leader whose sole responsibility is campus safety to guide us through tense times. This organizational structure, which elevates our safety and emergency management operations, has proven to be an effective one at other major universities across the country.\n\nLeading the Office of Campus Safety as its inaugural associate vice chancellor is Rick Braziel, who brings to the position more than 30 years of public safety service, including five years as chief of police for the City of Sacramento. Braziel has also served as an instructor in community policing and has led reviews of law enforcement agencies and police responses.\n\nAdditionally, I have created a formal advisory group with expert leaders who will partner with AVC Braziel. Members of this advisory group include UC Davis Chief of Police and Coordinator of the Council of UC Chiefs of Police Joe Farrow, Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Professor of Health Policy and Management Vickie Mays and UC Office of the President Systemwide Director of Community Safety Jody Stiger. I am confident that AVC Braziel, in partnership with this advisory group, will provide effective new leadership of our safety and emergency management operations.\n\nThe well-being of our students, faculty and staff is paramount. These actions are essential for creating a secure environment where everyone at UCLA can confidently pursue their studies and careers.\"\n\nStay informed!

This remains an important priority.\"\n\nHe said that the university and its police force are leading the investigation, which involves sifting through security footage from the night and speaking to witnesses who were present. He called on other witnesses to come forward.\n\nThe LAPD is also involved in the probe while the FBI has been contacted about assisting too, Block said, although it is unclear what role, if any, the FBI will play. Fox News Digital requested comment from the FBI but did not receive a response prior to publication.\n\nCALIFORNIA STATE OFFICIALS CONDEMN VIOLENT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS AT UCLA\n\nBlock says the university has also spoken to Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n to solicit help in \"ensuring that the instigators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nHe also said that a new Office of Campus Safety has been created to review UCPD's response to the attacks. A broader assessment of all acts of violence on campus during the anti-Israel protests is also being looked at.\n\n\"Holding the instigators of this attack accountable and enhancing our campus safety operations are both critical. Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,\" Block said.\n\nThe news comes just days after the police union representing officers at University of California schools criticized UCLA administrators for the \"lack of response\" to the violence that broke out on campus. The union has called for an independent investigation into the response.\n\n\"UC administrators are solely responsible for the university's response to campus protests, and they own all the fallout from those responses,\" Federated University Police Officers Association president Wade Stern said in a press release on Saturday.\n\nLaw enforcement initially stood by while the violence unfolded early Wednesday, according to Fox 11. Local police in riot gear did not respond to the scene until hours later.\n\nPhotos and videos online captured a glimpse of the chaos on UCLA's campus as they showed people throwing chairs, using sticks and weapons to beat each other and shoving and kicking one another. Firecrackers were also tossed into groups of people and pepper spray was deployed at various times.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLaw enforcement eventually moved in and cleared the encampment and more than 200 protesters were arrested.\n\nStudents told Fox 11 they were frustrated about the lack of response by the university.

Throughout April it grew to be one of the largest in the country, with it's encampment dwarfing even Columbia's in New York. However, supporters of Israel and those opposing antisemitism began challenging those protesters on campus. In the first clash, both sides fought it out until police broke them up. Not wanting police to crackdown on protesters, the University held them back after the first incident.\n\nHowever, only days later, a second scuffle broke out, with fireworks even being fired at protestors on campus. It took hours before police were finally amassed and brought in, delayed by the University hoping to avoid them being on campus. A total of 15 people were injured, with one hospitalized as a result. With the UCLA administration feeling pressure following the second incident, the LAPD and the California Highway Patrol finally broke up the encampment on May 2nd. This led to 210 people being arrested, and the encampment being torn down. The campus was also closed for the rest of the week as a precaution, giving protestors no where to go as a result. The encampment being torn down and the arrests made international news. Some protests still resumed, with some faculty joining in, but the University believed that they had mostly died down after that.\n\nWith the encampment gone, UCLA was poised to bring in-person classes back this week. However, that proved to be wishful thinking. Campus was closed off Monday with classes later made remote the entire week because of another major protest occurring in a parking garage. Police cleared it early Monday and arrested another 43 protesters. The University, having already set up consequences for protesters, also decided to go after counter protesters who acted violently. The LAPD will even be bringing in facial recognition software to help find those responsible.\n\nAnd as of Wednesday, that's where things stand at UCLA. Pro-Hamas, pro-Palestine protesters and counter protesters have largely been cowed away from campus because of everything going remote. Law enforcement is prevalent on campus to avoid any more big protests. UCLA's commencement is still currently scheduled in for June 13th through June 16th, with the University fortunate enough to have not had them scheduled for May like other universities who have either had to cancel them or been disrupted. Even cross-town rival USC cancelled their commencement.\n\nBut students on campus are upset. After years of COVID restrictions and finally getting back the traditional college experience, the protests made an uncomfortable return to remote classes, with some students afraid that, after high school graduations cancelled because of COVID-19, students graduating 4 years later may now have to have the same sort of remote graduation.\n\nStudents speak out against protests\n\n\"Don't judge UCLA students based on these protests,\" said student Rachel Diaz to the Globe on Wednesday. \"Most of us may feel more for the Palestinians or Israel, but we aren't protesting or getting the police involved. We just have an opinion then go to class because we want to learn. We want to write papers, do projects and get that experience. Ok, haha, wanting to write papers is a bit of a stretch, but you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"We're paying for this, our parents are paying for this, we have scholarships or we have loans to be going here. Most of us want to get that degree. But these protesters, and counter protesters, they just are ruining everything. I understand they have a right to protest and that they feel strongly about the situation in Gaza and want the university to divest, but when they make things worse for the rest of us, they go over the line.\"\n\n\"You aren't hearing this in the media, but a lot of us are pissed at them for making us go remote again. I'd say way more than half the students here at least.\"\n\n\"You should be hearing what we are saying or messaging to each other,\" said Greg, another student. \"A lot of us want the protesters expelled or suspended. We want their scholarships taken away. We want them to not be able to live on campus. No housing assistance. Not being able to get on-campus jobs. That's what most of us are thinking.\n\n\"Right now, if you see what is happening, it is just some loud protesters and everyone thinks that all the students think like that. And we don't. You know what the average student on campus is right now? They're just going to class. Yeah, there might be talks of parties and things like that. This is college. But we also know to study and do all the upcoming work. We are UCLA too. But these protesters. Why can't they be peaceful? Why can't they be non-disruptive?\"\n\nA third student, Carmen, said, \"I'd say more students than not were on the side of the protesters until that huge encampment thing and campus was shut down. Now more students are glad to see police on campus. I still go out around there even with remote classes and it's finally quiet.\"\n\n\"I missed my High School graduation because of COVID, and if they make me miss my graduation this year I don't know what I'll do. My parents just want to see me get that diploma on stage. I'll be the first college graduate in my family in the US. These protesters cannot take this away from me or from any of us.\"\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V. Symon is the Senior Editor for the California Globe.

The group set off fireworks in and around the encampment, and there were reports of pepper spray and bear repellent being deployed.\n\nRepresentatives of the encampment said more than a dozen people were injured, primarily due to the exposure to pepper spray.\n\nPolice in riot gear eventually quelled the violence, but law enforcement and the university were criticized for failing to intervene more quickly, allowing the unrest to continue for several hours.\n\nIn a message to the UCLA community Monday, Chancellor Gene Block said the university remains committed to identifying the attackers. He said Chief Safety Officer Rick Braziel is leading the investigation, and the LAPD has committed a detective to the task.\n\nCiting unnamed law enforcement sources, the Los Angeles Times reported that the investigation will include the use of facial-recognition technology, while also employing license plate readers to determine who entered the campus or was driving in the vicinity that night. The investigative tools are comparable to those used by federal authorities investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the wake of the attacks and the next night's law enforcement raid that cleared out the encampment and led to more than 200 arrests, Block over the weekend announced the creation of the Office of Campus Safety, with Braziel placed in charge.\n\nBlock said that office is also conducting a review of the UC Police Department's response to the attack and an analysis of UCLA's security protocols. It is assessing all acts of violence on campus over the past 12 days. Braziel is expected to establish additional means of protecting students, staff and visitors on campus, Block said.\n\n\"Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,'' Block wrote.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom and other elected officials have called for an investigation into the law enforcement response to the attack. UC President Michael Drake also said the university system would be conducting an audit of UCLA's actions and responses to the encampment and the attack.\n\nThe union that represents campus police officers at the 10 University of California schools blamed UCLA administrators for the delayed response to the attack and other violence between counterprotesters and people at the pro-Palestinian encampment.\n\nThe Federated University Police Officers' Association said in a statement Saturday that the probe by Drake into the university's \"planning, actions and response by law enforcement'' must consider the UC's own guidelines for response to campus protests.\n\n\"The written guidelines for roles and responsibilities make clear that senior UC administrators on each campus are solely responsible for the university's response to campus protests; those administrators decide the objective, and campus police are only responsible for tactics in implementing those objectives,'' FUPOA President Wade Stern said.\n\n\"As such, the UCLA administration owns all the fallout from the response and lack of response to this protest.''", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

The announcement Sunday came after UCLA was criticized for its handling of demonstrations that culminated in a mob attack on a pro-Palestinian student encampment last week.\n\nOn May 2, officers surged against a crowd of demonstrators at UCLA, ultimately taking at least 200 protesters into custody after hundreds defied orders to leave, some forming human chains as police fired flash-bangs to break up the crowds. Police tore apart a fortified encampment's barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and dumpsters, then pulled down canopies and tents.\n\nLike at UCLA, tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across other campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. Iranian state television carried live images of the police action at UCLA, as did Qatar's pan-Arab Al Jazeera satellite network. Live images of Los Angeles also played across Israeli television networks.\n\nIsrael has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers - some of whom are Jewish - call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.\n\nThe confrontations at UCLA also played out over several days last week. Block told alumni on a May 2 call that the trouble started after a permitted pro-Israel rally was held on campus April 28 and fights broke out and \"live mice\" were tossed into the pro-Palestinian encampment later that day.\n\nIn the following days, administrators tried to find a peaceful solution with members of the encampment and expected things to remain stable, Block said.\n\nThat changed, he said, when counterdemonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment. Campus administrators and police did not intervene or call for backup for hours. No one was arrested that night, but at least 15 protesters were injured. The delayed response drew criticism from political leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, and officials pledged an independent review.\n\n\"We certainly weren't thinking that we'd end up with a large number of violent people, that hadn't happened before,\" Block said on the call.\n\nBy May 1, the encampment had become \"much more of a bunker\" and there was no other solution but to have police dismantle it, he said.\n\nThe hourslong standoff went into the early morning hours as officers warned over loudspeakers that there would be arrests if the crowd - at the time more than 1,000 strong inside the encampment as well as outside of it - did not disperse. Hundreds left voluntarily, while another 200-plus remained and were ultimately taken into custody.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

Tensions continue to flare as pro-Palestine protests persist, investigations into a violent attack on a pro-Palestine encampment unfold, and pro-Israel groups raise funds for counter-protests.\n\nDespite the dismantling of the pro-Palestine encampment and mass arrests by police in riot gear last Thursday, demonstrations continued on Monday. Several dozen students were detained, with some being zip-tied and transported from a parking garage by authorities. Local news reports indicate 43 protesters were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary, but later released after processing. All classes have been transitioned to online learning.\n\nAdding another layer to the campus turmoil, a group of roughly 20 UCLA faculty members staged a protest outside the Hammer Museum's gala on Saturday evening. The event honored outgoing director Ann Philbin, with a guest list boasting celebrities like Jane Fonda and Keanu Reeves. Host Jodie Foster acknowledged the recent campus upheaval, which resulted in hundreds of student arrests and the cancellation of classes. Philbin echoed this sentiment, expressing support for freedom of expression and the right to protest. Meanwhile, protesting faculty members, some holding X-rays purportedly showing broken bones sustained by students during the attack, voiced their outrage over the mass arrests, including some of their students.\n\nPolice have yet to make any arrests related to the violent attack on the pro-Palestine encampment at Royce Quad last week. The encampment, occupied by demonstrators for over a week demanding UCLA divest from organizations contributing to the alleged \"genocide\" of Palestinians in Gaza, was attacked by a masked group of men late on April 30th, just hours after Chancellor Gene Block declared the camp illegal. Witnesses reported the attackers, mostly men carrying pro-Israel paraphernalia, yelling in Hebrew as they assaulted individuals and ignited fireworks near the encampment.\n\nThe campus security response and local police actions have sparked multiple investigations. Chancellor Block announced a UCLA investigation alongside an additional investigation by the head of the UC system. Amidst ongoing finger-pointing and accusations, Block established a new campus department: The Office of Campus Safety, tasked with managing emergencies. Rick Braziel, a former Sacramento police chief, will serve as the inaugural associate vice chancellor.\n\nThe New York Times video investigative team, piecing together available footage, published an in-depth analysis of the events at the encampment. Their investigation concluded that pro-Palestine demonstrators largely remained peaceful throughout the attack, aside from acts of self-defense. The Times referred to the attackers as counter-protesters and reported that the violent incident lasted nearly five hours.\n\nOnline sleuths are actively trying to identify the attackers and their potential affiliation. One attacker, interviewed by a reporter between assaults, stated he wasn't a UCLA student but believed the encampment was blocking students from attending classes - a claim Chancellor Block echoed when declaring the encampment illegal.\n\nFollowing the attack and subsequent dismantlement of the encampment with approximately 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators arrested, attention has shifted to a GoFundMe fundraising page claiming to organize counter-protests against the UCLA encampment. Titled \"Fighting Antisemitism on Campus,\" the page has raised over $97,000 as of Monday. The Daily Beast identified the page creator as Beverly Hills resident Nathan Mo, though the author's name recently changed to \"Jew Bears For Truth,\" aligning with a linked Instagram account that shared footage from the April 30th attack.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that the fundraiser initially stated plans to bring large screens and loudspeakers near the encampment to \"drown out their chants with the screams and cries of October 7th,\" possibly referencing a past event. The GoFundMe page title has changed multiple times, including \"UCLA counter-protest,\" \"Bruins for Israel,\" and \"UCLA rally.\" The Hollywood Reporter attempted to contact the group or individual behind the page for an interview but has not yet received a response.", "source": {"uri": "phonemantra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest Mobiles / Latest Smartphone Launches | New Mobiles |

The arrests - which led to part of the day in a Van Nuys jail -- prompted an outcry from organizers, such as the Students for Justice in Palestine. The group alleged the arrests were \"unlawful.\" The detainees -- who released later on Monday -- were not in the act of protesting when they were arrested, they said.\n\nThey laid ultimate blame on UCLA Chancellor Gene Block, who late Monday said an investigation was underway into the violent attacks at Royce Quad at UCLA last week, which the university's chancellor has called \"a truly despicable act.\"\n\nIn a notice sent to the UCLA community on Monday, Block said identifying those responsible for the violence on campus remained an important priority.\n\nA group of what Block calls instigators came to Royce Quad on the night of Tuesday, April 30, and attacked students, faculty and staff members encamped with the Palestinian supporters.\n\nThe UCLA Police Department, also known as UCPD, is reviewing surveillance footage for clues.\n\nThe UC announced Tuesday it was hiring 21st Century Policing Solutions -- a police-tactics consulting firm -- to lead the university system's independent investigation of actions taken at UCLA that culminated in last week's violence.\n\n\"Our campuses must be places where our community members can safely engage in the University of California's mission of teaching, research, and public service,\" Drake said in a statement. \"This independent review will provide us with more information to shore up our ability to protect our community members and their rights while keeping them safe from harm. The Regents and I look forward to the findings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, campuses large and small, from Orange County to Claremont to L.A., continued to face the impact of ongoing and dismantled encampments and continued protests.\n\nUC San Diego was reeling from the first large, violent confrontation between police and protesters on the UCSD campus in decades, which also led the university to move classes online and close vehicular access to the school grounds west of Interstate 5 on Monday.\n\nThere, police in riot gear swooped in Monday in an early morning raid, and cleared an encampment of pro-Palestinian protesters. When it was done, 65 people had been arrested prompting skirmishes with hundreds of protest supporters - and criticism.\n\nThe crackdown drew swift condemnation from some faculty members - and frustration from many students over the tactics, but also over the response of closing the campus to in-person learning.\n\nThe protests, in general, have been fueled by demands that academic institutions divest, or withdraw funds that their endowments have invested in companies linked to Israel. They're also seeking public disclosure of such funding. As events have unfolded, other demands have centered around specific campuses. For instance, at UCLA, faculty members have called amnesty for student protesters, a university investigation and for the university to cover injured students' medical bills.\n\nAt UC Riverside, administrators struck an agreement with leaders of the student encampment last week, leading to a clearing of the occupied campus area. In return, occupying students got transparency of UC's investments and a task force to explore the possibility of UCR's endowment to be removed from the management of the UC Investments Office.\n\nAn encampment at UC Irvine entered its ninth day Tuesday, with speakers, prayers, a rally and other activities planned.\n\nUniversity officials said on Monday there had been minimal reports of petty vandalism and disruption of university activities.\n\n\"To date, the situation at UC Irvine has presented fewer risks of disruption and fewer concerns about campus safety than has been experienced at other universities,\" the Monday evening statement said.\n\nA second encampment was established at Pomona College in Claremont in the early hours of Monday, only a month after the arrests of 20 student protestors.\n\nThe encampment is still occupying the commencement stage, as the group has created a barricade around the tented area planned for ceremonies.\n\nTent numbers appeared to have increased as the encampment heads into the close of day two. With graduation slated for May 10, there have been no further updates from Pomona College on the possible suspension of ceremonies.\n\nWhile not quite festive, the atmosphere was hopeful at the campus of Cal State L.A., where pro-Palestinian protesters have set up their encampment -- about two dozen tents and a dozen canopy shades -- outside the Eagle's Nest gym for the second straight week.\n\nThe \"emergency mobilization\" began on May Day, May 1 -- also known as International Workers Day -- in solidarity with campuses across the nation, and has since grown to include barricades made from pallets and scavenged pieces of wood to protect the roughly two dozen tents inside, some providing food and water, others offering classes on subjects such as antisemitism and media training.\n\nOrganizers with Students for Justice in Palestine at CSULA are demanding the university disclose its investments and divest. Additionally, protesters want the university to call for a permanent ceasefire, condemn the \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinian people, and to boycott organizations that continue to support the war.\n\n\"I'm glad they're still here, we weren't sure what was going to happen when we came back over the weekend,\" said Cyntnia Godinez, a student not involved in the protests.\n\nLike Godinez, many students said they supported the demonstrators, and worried that their campus could be home to the type of tense police confrontations seen at other universities.\n\n\"It's not what I want to focus on right now (near final exams) but I'm just happy that there's people out there willing to take the risk with everything going on at other schools,\" Godinez said.\n\nHowever that may not last, according to a May 5 message from CSULA President Berenecea J. Eanes. In the emailed message to students, which came just days after university officials said that any vandalism or destruction of property would not be tolerated, Eanes said that over the weekend \"several buildings and state property were defaced with graffiti,\" including anti-Semitic rhetoric.\n\n\"We are increasing security and investigating the individual or individuals responsible for the graffiti,\" Eanes' statement said. \"And in the interest of public safety, we are increasing security measures to act swiftly and decisively if further unlawful activity occurs.\"\n\nUniversity officials did not respond to questions about the specifics surrounding the graffiti, including what it said, whether it was linked to the protesters, if they plan to meet any of the demands, or if they plan to dismantle the camp.\n\nSJP organizers though have condemned Eanes' statement, denied any involvement and denounced the \"lack of support Palestinians have received in the face of Zionist intimidation.\"\n\n\"Although the president has repeatedly affirmed she values safety, by mislabeling our group as hateful or antisemitic she is putting students participating in our rights to protest in danger,\" the statement said. \"Lies like this being spread to the entire campus are dangerous as we have seen in other institutions such as UCLA.\"\n\nThere did not appear to be counterprotestors and police presence appeared minimal.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Biden used a ceremony to remember victims of the Holocaust to also denounce new waves of violence and hateful rhetoric toward Jews.\n\nBiden said that on Oct. 7, Hamas \"brought to life\" that hatred with the killing of more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and warned that, already, people are beginning to forget who was responsible.\n\nThe president used his address to renew his declarations of unwavering support for Israel in its war against Hamas even as his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown increasingly strained over Israel's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which would surely worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis for Palestinians.\n\nIn response to anti-Semitic acts on campuses, the Biden administration announced an initiative that will provide guidance to school districts and colleges to help promote safety on campus.\n\nAt Cal State LA, students were largely in support of the move, but wanted the Biden administration to do more to help people in Gaza.\n\n\"I'm all for the safety on campus but it has to be safety for everyone, not just one group,\" said Kevin Tong. \"We can't just support one side any longer.\"\n\nOthers touted the speech at what they see as a pivotal moment.\n\n\"President Biden may have delivered his most important speech of his presidency today,\" said Richard Hirschhaut, Los Angeles director of American Jewish Committee. \"The president put into words what so many Jews are experiencing around the world, especially Jewish college students.\n\n\"We commend President Biden for not only standing up against rising antisemitism, but for reminding the world of the realities of the Holocaust and the continuing impact and trauma of October 7th.\"\n\nHirschhaut said many protesters are continuing to perpetuate \"false narratives\" about Israel and threatening Jewish students, and urged folks to watch or read the speech.\n\nBiden has struggled to balance his support for Israel since the attack by Hamas -- the deadliest day for Jews worldwide since the Holocaust -- with his efforts to protect civilian life in Gaza.\n\nWhile acknowledging the ceremony was taking place during \"difficult times,\" Biden made no explicit reference to the deaths of more than 34,700 Palestinians since the attack by Hamas led Israel to declare war in Gaza. The tally from the Hamas-run health ministry includes militants, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nFor many local campuses, graduations come amid the protests, prompting re-worked ceremonies, sealed off from the optics of a protest.\n\nFour days of commencement celebrations will begin on Wednesday at USC following weeks of campus unrest that was highlighted by the arrest of 93 protesters who attempted to occupy Alumni Park, leading to the university's cancellation of its annual main stage graduation ceremony.\n\nGraduation celebrations will begin at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday with a series of doctoral hooding ceremonies at various campus locations, along with a variety of other commencement activities throughout the day.\n\nAdditional ceremonies are planned for the rest of the week, with the bulk of the individual school events planned on Friday.\n\nThe traditional main stage ceremony, which had been scheduled for Friday and annually attracts more than 60,000 people to Alumni Park, was scrubbed last month amid campus unrest. In its place, the university will hold a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at 8:30 p.m. Thursday at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. University officials said the event will include \"drone shows, fireworks, surprise performances, the Trojan Marching Band, and a special gift just for the Class of 2024.\"\n\nSo far, most universities seem to have held to their original plans.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This remains an important priority.\"\n\nHe said that the university and its police force are leading the investigation, which involves sifting through security footage from the night and speaking to witnesses who were present. He called on other witnesses to come forward.\n\nThe LAPD is also involved in the probe while the FBI has been contacted about assisting too, Block said, although it is unclear what role, if any, the FBI will play. Fox News Digital requested comment from the FBI but did not receive a response prior to publication.\n\nCALIFORNIA STATE OFFICIALS CONDEMN VIOLENT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS AT UCLA\n\nBlock says the university has also spoken to Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n to solicit help in \"ensuring that the instigators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nHe also said that a new Office of Campus Safety has been created to review UCPD's response to the attacks. A broader assessment of all acts of violence on campus during the anti-Israel protests is also being looked at.\n\n\"Holding the instigators of this attack accountable and enhancing our campus safety operations are both critical. Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,\" Block said.\n\nThe news comes just days after the police union representing officers at University of California schools criticized UCLA administrators for the \"lack of response\" to the violence that broke out on campus. The union has called for an independent investigation into the response.\n\n\"UC administrators are solely responsible for the university's response to campus protests, and they own all the fallout from those responses,\" Federated University Police Officers Association president Wade Stern said in a press release on Saturday.\n\nLaw enforcement initially stood by while the violence unfolded early Wednesday, according to Fox 11. Local police in riot gear did not respond to the scene until hours later.\n\nPhotos and videos online captured a glimpse of the chaos on UCLA's campus as they showed people throwing chairs, using sticks and weapons to beat each other and shoving and kicking one another.

Those involved left, and no arrests were made.\n\nBut the trail is not cold.\n\nUCLA detectives are now scanning hundreds of images in an attempt to identify the attackers. They intend to use technology that captures facial images and compares them to other photos on the internet and social media to put names to faces, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nThe same technology has allowed police to identify suspects in smash-and-grab retail burglaries. It also was the heart of the Jan. 6 investigation, in which videos of those storming the U.S. Capitol helped the FBI identify many of the assailants and led federal prosecutors to charge more than 1,300 people. In those cases, investigators often were able to find social media images of the assailant wearing the same clothing as during the attack.\n\n\"Technology has made the entire community into the eyes of law enforcement,\" said retired Los Angeles police Capt. Paul Vernon, who led an effort after a mini-riot following the Lakers' NBA champion victory in 2010 that resulted in dozens of arrests based on videos, social media posts and security footage. \"Photo recognition has gotten a lot easier.\"\n\nRead more: UCLA's top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions\n\nVernon said an investigator also could gather cellphone data from the immediate area to prove an individual was there at the time of the incident. In some cases, assailants may have posted to their social media accounts, essentially bragging about their actions. Officers wearing body cameras may have also captured some of the behavior, he said.\n\nThe attackers likely came in vehicles, so UCLA police will be examining data from license plate readers for movements near campus early Wednesday. Security cameras on streets neighboring the campus where they likely parked could yield more clues.\n\nAlong with continuing protests, finding those who attacked the camp will be a major challenge for newly installed UCLA Associate Vice Chancellor Rick Braziel, a former Sacramento police chief. Braziel will be tasked with bringing to justice those responsible for what Chancellor Gene Block called a \"dark chapter in our campus history.\"\n\nRead more: Who were the masked men behind the UCLA camp attack? Online sleuths vow to find out\n\nDespite the technology, the probe faces hurdles. Some of the attackers wore masks, making it harder to identify them. In those instances, detectives will look for a moment before or after the attack when the perpetrators' faces were revealed, an official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly told The Times.\n\nThere is also deep anger among some protesters in the camp because it took so long for police to stop the attack. That distrust could take a toll. Many of the students who were injured, some of whom were hospitalized with their wounds, have gone to groups such as the Council on American Islamic Relations for Southern California but haven't spoken with campus police.\n\nUCLA is a small police department, so it is reaching out to other agencies and private entities to access the technology needed in the investigation, law enforcement sources said. But so far, UCLA hasn't made a public appeal seeking information on specific suspects.\n\nRead more: UCLA sought extra police but canceled requests in days before protest camp was attacked\n\nIn the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, the FBI made arrests based on information from relatives, work colleagues, teammates, former friends and ex-significant others after the FBI released photos of suspects. An army of web sleuths and politically knowledgeable social media watchers known as \"sedition hunters\" also dedicated themselves to identifying the mob and turning their names over to the FBI.\n\nImages from the UCLA attack are springing up on Instagram. In one case, a man can be seen using a plank to hit a pro-Palestinian protester and then punching and kicking others. Dressed in a black sweatshirt, white sweatpants and a black cap, his bearded face is not hidden. Police can use that image to track him or ask for help identifying him.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_winton@yahoo.com", "name": "Richard Winton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vernon, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vernon, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

A group of demonstrators was seen zip-tied and being moved by authorities from a UCLA parking garage to an LACPD bus. The number of protester arrests was 43, according to local news reports KTLA, with those taken into custody on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary and released after they were processed; all classes have now been moved to remote.\n\nThis follows a group of roughly 20 UCLA faculty who protested Saturday outside the campus' Hammer Museum as its outgoing director Ann Philbin was honored at an event where the guest list included Jane Fonda, Ava DuVernay, Keanu Reeves, Will Ferrell, Joel McHale and Owen Wilson, according to the LA Times. Host Jodie Foster made a neutral reference to the upheaval that rattled the campus last week and led to all classes being canceled amid the arrest of hundreds of students and pro-Palestine protests. Philibin also nodded to the protest, telling the Hollywood and art world crowd, \"We will defend the sacrosanct right to freedom of expression and the right to protest.\" Meanwhile, faculty riled up over the mass arrest of some of their students rallied outside, with one showing what she said was a X-ray of a student of hers' broken hand bones.\n\nPolice have made no arrests since the violent attack last week at UCLA's Royce Quad, where pro-Palestine demonstrators had been stationed for over a week, demanding UCLA divest itself and cut connections to organizations contributing to what they are calling the genocide of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Late on April 30, a masked group of men entered the campus and violently attacked the encampment hours after outgoing Chancellor Gene Block declared the camp illegal. Mostly men, the attackers were carrying items indicating they were pro-Israel, and some, according to a professor at the scene, yelled in Hebrew as they assaulted individuals and ignited fireworks that exploded over and near at the encampment.\n\nThe response by campus security and local police has brought about multiple investigations -- one by the school, according to Block, and another by the head of the UC system -- the ongoing finger-pointing and blame-shifting led Block over the weekend to create a new department at UCLA. The Office of Campus Safety has now been launched to run emergency management and Rick Braziel, a former Sacramento chief of police, has been nominated with the title of inaugural associate vice chancellor.\n\nOutrage over the attack led the New York Times video investigative team to publish a thorough analysis of the events that took place after piecing together available footage; the publication's probe concludes that, aside from acts of defense, the pro-Palestine demonstrators had remained largely peaceful throughout the attack. The Times, referring to the attackers as counter-protesters, reports that the violent incident lasted for nearly five hours.\n\n\"The violence had been instigated by dozens of people who are seen in videos counter-protesting the encampment,\" the Times' report states, later citing local police and California Highway Patrol officers who eventually arrived to quell the violent scene: \"Throughout the intermittent violence, officers were captured on video standing about 300 feet away from the area for roughly an hour, without stepping in.\"\n\nOnline sleuths have since launched attempts to identify the attackers and discover with whom or what they may be affiliated. One man from the group of attackers had stopped to be interviewed by a reporter between attacks on the encampment. Speaking as he struggles to breathe after being exposed to a chemical agent, the yet-to-be-identified man tells the reporter that he does not attend UCLA and that he was there because he believes that the demonstrators at the encampment had been blocking students from attending classes; this was also a point made in Block's letter to the UCLA community and which he said led the administration to deem the encampment illegal earlier that day.\n\nFollowing the attack, which came a day before police dismantled the encampment and arrested approximately 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators, attention has turned to the group or individual behind a GoFundMe fundraising page claiming to be organizing counter-protests to the UCLA encampment. The plea for funds, which has raised $97,974 as of Monday, is being called \"Fighting antisemitism on campus.\" According to The Daily Beast, the creator of the page is Beverly Hills resident Nathan Mo, but the page author has recently been changed to the moniker Jew Bears For Truth, matching a linked Instagram account that shared footage from the April 30 attack.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that the fundraiser initially stated: \"A group of us are planning something very big for the ucla encampment... we are working to bring a huge screen and big loud speakers right next to them and just play nonstop clips and interviews from Oct 7.\n\n\"In order to do this right we need lots of equipment, logistics, staff and security,\" the post added. \"If we all pitch in a bit then we can make this a legendary counter move and drown out their chants with the screams and cries of October 7th.\" The GoFundMe page title changed multiple times, including to \"UCLA counter-protest\" (which is the URL that remains), \"Bruins for Israel,\" \"UCLA rally\" and finally, as of Monday, \"Fighting antisemitism on campus.\" The Hollywood Reporter contacted the group or individual for an interview but did not immediately receive a response on Monday.\n\nThe group caught the eye of author Jessica Seinfeld, who shared the page with her Instagram followers while mentioning her $5,000 donation. Seinfeld's husband is the famous comedian, Jerry Seinfeld, and the donation led to scrutiny of his affiliations and a trip he recently took to Israel in a weekend New York Times story. Meanwhile, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman touted his donation to a separate but affiliated GoFundMe called \"Support Loud Video Displays of Oct 7 Truths,\" which has raised $53, 248.\n\n\"We're planning to take this momentum to the next level, and in the next week or two, we'll be targeting either Columbia or Harvard University, \" the page by a person identified as Dani M. wrote. \"Our goal is to continue making our voices heard. As long as it takes.\" The fundraiser is connected to the Shirion Collective, which describes itself in a bio on Twitter as a private Jewish surveillance force.", "source": {"uri":

Blame campus leadership", "body": "To the editor: In my long history with UCLA, first as a graduate (class of 1992) and now as an employee, I have never been more ashamed of our campus leaders than I am now. Their decisions have been both morally bankrupt and catastrophically foolish. (\"UCLA's top cop, accused of security lapse, faces calls to step aside. He defends his actions,\" May 3)\n\nFirst, UCLA leadership and police failed to protect peaceful student protesters from a violent mob. Then, in the name of \"safety,\" they targeted these protesters -- the victims of that assault -- and invited law enforcement to remove them by force.\n\nNot satisfied with mere incompetence, campus leadership now has apparently veered into outright authoritarianism, by arresting students for \"conspiracy to commit burglary,\" simply for planning a sit-in.\n\nAs I write this, classes have been moved online -- again -- for the rest of this week. Our main undergraduate library is closed. Police, many in riot gear, are all over campus.\n\nI am at a loss to understand how UCLA's leaders could possibly believe their decisions will restore our campus to any sense of calm. How can the community have any faith in leaders who have abandoned their core duty to our students and to the principle of freedom of expression?\n\nThe chief of UCLA's police force said he warned campus leaders \"not to allow an encampment, since it violated campus rules against overnight camping, and he feared it would lead to problems.\"\n\nHe said he was advised that UCLA would allow the encampment to remain \"as an expression of students' 1st Amendment rights,\" thereby canceling the enforcement of the university's own rule against camping. So, the need for extra officers was unnecessary at that time. Naturally, there are conflicting accounts of the events leading up to last week's assault on the encampment.\n\nThe administrators, in reality, were delegating their power to control access to a significant portion of the campus to one protesting group. Non-protesting students were cut off from the main library and some of their classes.\n\nIs that really the mission of the university? Is that free speech, or is it anarchy? And isn't it predictable that violence and chaos would result?\n\nTo the editor: To the father who wrote in a letter that his son was hit in the head by an attacker at UCLA, I am sorry and upset for what happened to your son. I hope he heals physically and mentally and those responsible are brought to justice.\n\nTo the UCLA administration responsible for student safety, it seems like you are passing the buck. UCLA is one of the most esteemed universities to which parents entrust their children. You should have done better.\n\nTo the police who waited for hours to do something as the attack against the encampment unfolded, it seemed like another Uvalde response.\n\nTo the media, stop watering down your descriptions of the events.\n\nTo the politicians, you will just call for an investigation, hoping that over time the emotion of the event will have passed. Can't you do better?", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b9e5a1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2025+0+123/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe5%2F5c%2F2fe76e5b425491dd27cd5e2e6c49%2F1445184-me-ucla-parking-structure-arrest-48-brv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544486", "eventUri": "eng-9544486", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 348, "textEnd": 353}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Richard Davis of the UCLA campus police said the protesters arrested in a campus parking deck were charged with conspiracy to attempt burglary. A UCLA spokesperson later said that 44 people had been taken into custody.\n\nThe arrests came as pro-Palestinian demonstrators attempted a sit-in at Moore Hall, student organizers said. About 30 protesters were sitting in a corner of the parking deck around 9:45 a.m. local time, with their hands zip tied behind them. They were later taken to a sheriff's bus.\n\nThe university sent a message telling students and faculty members to avoid Moore Hall and switched to remote classes.\n\nAnother group of demonstrators amassed in nearby Dodd Hall, where about 40 were inside Monday morning, chanting, \"Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.\" They later moved outdoors to Bruin Plaza near the center of campus, where about 150 protesters had gathered by late morning.\n\nUCLA administrators originally took a tolerant approach to a pro-Palestinian encampment at the school, even as student protesters were arrested across the nation. But the peace was shattered late Tuesday: Videos analyzed by The New York Times showed pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacking students in the encampment, beating them with sticks, using chemical sprays and launching fireworks as weapons.\n\nNo arrests have been made in connection with the attack, which police allowed to continue for hours without intervention.

The petition also calls on the university to divest from all military weapons production companies, a key demand of pro-Palestinian protesters nationwide.\n\n\"We will not stand by as our students are assaulted and silenced,\" reads the statement signed by hundreds of UC staff.\n\nAmong them are 830 scholars and instructors in fields as varied as medicine, law, education, art history, political science and theater -- including 604 members of UCLA. Those were the numbers as of 11 a.m. Thursday as signatures continued to float in.\n\nOn April 30, an encampment at the UCLA campus set up in support of Palestinians in the Gaza war had attracted hundreds of demonstrators as well as counter-protesters after first emerging five days earlier. It mirrored demonstrations seen at colleges around the country such as Columbia University, where NYPD officers also responded after demonstrators camped out for days.\n\nThat night, fireworks were thrown at the encampment as violent clashes broke out between opposing groups of protesters, some getting pepper-sprayed amid the chaos. The violence drew the attention of Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass, who described the events of the evening as \"absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable.\"\n\nThe following day, local authorities declared the demonstrations an \"unlawful assembly.\" Police officers in riot gear used flashbang grenades to clear out the encampment and arrest more than 200 people.\n\nThe university said it would discipline students and faculty remaining there, possibly even expelling or firing them.\n\nDuring a protest at the school Thursday, UCLA faculty members from 10 different departments spoke before reporters and supporters, outlining their grievances with the university's response to protests, particularly the decision to call in police. They slammed that as an infringement on the right to free speech but also as a failure to protect students.\n\n\"Many students and faculty were left on the ground bleeding, gassed or concussed while private security personnel and LAPD riot police stood by without intervening,\" said Michael Cooperson, a professor of Near East Languages and Cultures.\n\nBlock has described the university's decision to call in outside law enforcement as necessary for safety, describing the outbreak of violence on May 1 as a \"horrific attack by a mob of instigators.\" Less than a week later, he announced that oversight and management of UCLA police and the Office of Emergency Management was being moved from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to the newly created Office of Campus Safety.\n\nUC President Michael V.

Tensions were already high on the campus, where a sizeable protest encampment that had been on the campus for weeks was cleared out days earlier by authorities in a pre-dawn police operation.\n\nDuring Monday's unrest, officers said they took people at the parking structure into custody to determine whether they were students, staff or faculty members. The campus is closed to anyone not affiliated with the university every day between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\n\"Multiple individuals in the group were in possession of tools and items that could be used to unlawfully enter and barricade a building, including heavy-duty metal pipes, bolt cutters, epoxy adhesive, super glue, padlocks, heavy-duty chains, and documentation encouraging violence and vandalism,\" UCLA police said in a news release.\n\nThe items found included literature titled, \"The Do-It-Yourself Occupant Guide, 2024 Edition.\" The guide's introduction says the updated edition \"comes in light of a nationwide resurgence of student occupations in 2024, beginning with Columbia University in New York, in response to an ongoing genocide in Palestine.\"\n\nPolice provided images of the document and tools in a news release. It was not immediately clear how many people in the group were in possession of the tools and documents.\n\nAt about the time of the detentions in the parking structure around 6 a.m. Monday, officers responded to UCLA's Moore Hall, where several people gathered inside and outside the building. Moore Hall was closed at the time. Campus police said a UCLA-registered student organization posted a statement on social media encouraging people to occupy the building.\n\n\"It became apparent that the individuals at Parking Structure 2 had formed a plan to use bolt cutters, padlocks, epoxy adhesive, super glue, heavy duty chains, and metal poles to break into Moore Hall to occupy and vandalize the location,\" police said.\n\nAt about 8:30 a.m., dozens of people left Moore Hall and walked to Dodd Hall, which was open and being used for midterm exams. They eventually left the building and joined a protest at Bruin Plaza before leaving the area.\n\nForty-two people were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit and crime. Two were taken into custody for obstructing a peace officer. They were booked and cited at a jail in the San Fernando Valley, then released from custody. Four of the 44 people arrested Monday had been arrested May 2 after failing to leave the Royce Quad tent encampment, despite a dispersal order, university police said.\n\nThirty of those arrested were UCLA students and nine had no affiliation with the school, police said. Two said they were members of the media, but did not have press credentials, according to police.\n\nOver the weekend, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block announced a newly created Office of Campus Safety to administer policing and emergency management. On May 23, Block is expected to testify before Congress about UCLA's response to antisemitism on the campus and actions to protect Jewish students.\n\nViolence broke out April 30 at the UCLA protest encampment when fights broke out between pro-Palestinian protesters and counter demonstrators.\n\nThe war in Gaza began Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. Israel says militants still hold around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli army ordered tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza's southern city of Rafah to start evacuating. The warning is a signal that a ground invasion could be imminent months after the Hamas militant group attack.\n\nThe Rafah border crossing with Egypt has been shut down since Israel's military took control of the Palestinian side early Tuesday. A first ship carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza was on its way Thursday to a floating platform built by the U.S. military.

Braziel, who will serve as the school's associate vice chancellor, will partner with UC Davis Police Chief and Council of UC Chiefs of Police Joe Farrow and other UC personnel to oversee safety and emergency management operations.\n\n\"I fully support this appointment and believe that it is an important step towards restoring confidence in our public safety systems and procedures,\" Block said in a statement.\n\nThe new office will investigate if any campus security lapses occurred when a large group of counterprotesters mounted an attack against pro-Palestinian demonstrators April 30 on the Westwood campus. It took about three hours for law enforcement officers -- from the California Highway Patrol, the LAPD and elsewhere -- to arrive and quell the violence, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nA day after the bloody clashes between protestors, police dismantled the encampment outside Royce Hall and arrested over 200 people.\n\nBraziel served as chief of the Sacramento Police Department from 2008 to 2012 before assuming the post examining the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office use of force incidents as a neutral arbiter.\n\nServing as the inspector general from December 2015 until November 2018 proved to be a tumultuous time. Braziel was locked out of county facilities by then-Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones after he disagreed with Braziel's report over the 2017 shooting of Mikel McIntyre on Highway 50.\n\nBraziel left the Sacramento County post and became the president of his own consulting company, Braziel Consulting Inc., according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nHe has since served on panels created by the U.S. Department of Justice to review law enforcement's approach to mass casualty incidents. In the latest instance, Braziel was tapped to review authorities' response to a mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishani_desai@sacbee.com", "name": "Ishani Desai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

People were being beaten and hit with sticks, and at times protesters would use barricades as weapons.\n\nAccording to KTLA5, dozens of counter-protesters wearing white masks and flags over their shoulders, arrived to the encampment around 10:45 p.m. in an effort to dismantle the pro-Palestinian encampment that has overtaken Royce Quad since Thursday, April 25th.\n\nVideo shared by NBC4 shows images of the confrontation that took place around 11:40 p.m. in front of the encampment barricade on Dickson Plaza near Powell Library and Kaplan Hill. While reports from NBC 4 state that there were no reports of any injuries, ABC 7 reported that before the arrival of police, a group piled on one person who laid on the ground, kicking and beating them until others pulled them out of the scrum.\n\nAdditionally, according to news9live, a video showing a Jewish girl being assaulted has surfaced. The incident is said to have occurred during the anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian protest that was happening on the UCLA campus at Dickinson Plaza.\n\nThe video was shared on X, formerly Twitter, by a witness who goes by the name, \"@ThatKoreanJew.\" The girl allegedly suffered injuries on the head and was rushed to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe violence escalated when counter-protesters surrounded the pro-Palestinian encampment. The clashes took place just outside a tent encampment where pro-Palestinian protesters erected barricades and plywood for protection; counter-protesters allegedly tried to pull those barricades down. Vandals also sprayed graffiti on the doors of Royce Hall.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said that they were in contact with campus police before they got involved around 1:30 a.m. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) also said that they were requested to send units, but reports indicate that more than two hours had passed with no uniformed campus police or LAPD officers on scene.\n\nAround 3:00 a.m., officers dispersed the crowd. Mutual aid responded to the campus, including Santa Monica and Culver City police. In a social media post, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said, \"The violence unfolding this evening at UCLA is absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable.\" Bass was in Washington, D.C. at the time of the protest, but said she would be returning to Los Angeles early in wake of the incident.\n\nAs of this writing, it is unclear how many others have been injured or if any arrests have been made. Mary Osako, vice chancellor for UCLA Strategic Communications told the campus newspaper, the Daily Bruin, \"Horrific acts of violence occurred at the encampment tonight and we immediately called law enforcement for mutual aid support.\" She added, \"We are sickened by this senseless violence and it must end.\"\n\nOn Monday, April 29, campus police reportedly broke up several fights after a group of about 60 pro-Israeli demonstrators tried to push through the encampment's barricade. Due to the violent events, university officials decided to close Royce Hall until Friday, May 3 and Powell Library until Monday, May 6.\n\nFor corrections or revisions, click here.

The letter also called for authorities to drop all charges against students, staff and faculty who were involved in the encampment.\n\nThe mass faculty action at one of the most prominent public universities in the US comes as campuses across the country have been roiled by pro-Palestinian encampment demonstrations and aggressive law enforcement crackdowns during graduation season.\n\nHolding signs that said, \"Take a walk, Block\", \"UCLA faculty and staff ... stand with our students\" and \"Disclose & Divest\", professors from across departments recounted the brutal violence by counter-demonstrators on 30 April as police failed to intervene, and the subsequent mass arrests of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators.\n\n\"We are outraged at the university's failure to protect its students from vigilante and police violence and its refusal to uphold its stated values as made evident in the forcible removal and arrest of peacefully protesting students, faculty and staff,\" said Dan Froot, a UCLA world arts and cultures and dance professor representing senate faculty from his department.\n\nA group of volunteer medics who helped care for demonstrators injured by police and counter-demonstrators told reporters that they had treated a wide range of injuries, including severe head lacerations, facial fractures, subarachnoid hemorrhages, rubber-bullet wounds, broken bones and asthma attacks from chemical irritants. Katherine Marino, a history professor who read a statement from faculty in her department, noted that at least 25 students had been hospitalized and roughly 200 protesters had been arrested, with police \"dragging visibly injured students away\".\n\nThe letter also expressed solidarity with students' demands, calling on UCLA to publish a report within 30 days disclosing all investments and for the university to \"divest from military-weapons-production companies and supporting systems\".\n\nSusan Slyomovics, an anthropology professor, read a statement on behalf of 75 Jewish faculty and staff, saying Block had \"misused Jews\" by suggesting the encampment had to be dismantled to prevent antisemitism: \"We assert that critiques of Israel are not presumptively antisemitic ... that Jews who support the liberation of Palestine must not be devalued.\"\n\nThe faculty action comes as UAW local 4811, the largest union of academic workers representing 48,000 graduate student workers throughout the University of California system, is voting on a possible strike over administrators' response to pro-Palestinian protests. Matt Barreto, a professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, said the group of professors was discussing the \"possibility to withhold our own additional labor\" until the demands are met. If graduate students go on strike, professors will not cross picket lines or do their work, he said.\n\nUCLA and the Los Angeles police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Block announced earlier this week the creation of a campus safety office, headed by a former Sacramento police chief, to \"identify the perpetrators of the violence and hold them to account\".\n\nPurnima Mankekar, a UCLA anthropology professor, said she felt an obligation to defend students at the encampment, and that she had gone to great lengths to de-escalate violent attacks from counter demonstrators. \"My job is to make sure the learning and intellectual growth of our students goes unimpeded ... When that gets disrupted by violence that is perpetrated on them by outside instigators or by the police, that makes me very upset,\" she said.\n\nIf students are unable to engage in peaceful protests, \"the university is not a university, it's a police state\", she added. \"The parents of our students entrust us with them. It's our job to keep them safe.\"\n\nIt was significant that so many faculty had signed on to the letter, said Gary Segura, professor of public policy, political science and Chicano/a studies, and a former dean. \"Even faculty who may not have agreed with the student protesters' underlying issues were mortified by the video of LAPD cops firing [less-lethal munitions] into the crowd. Those are students. I found it just terrifying.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_levin@theguardian.com", "name": "Sam Levin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

Those involved left, and no arrests were made.\n\nBut the trail is not cold.\n\nUCLA detectives are now scanning hundreds of images in an attempt to identify the attackers. They intend to use technology that captures facial images and compares them to other photos on the internet and social media to put names to faces, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nThe same technology has allowed police to identify suspects in smash-and-grab retail burglaries. It also was the heart of the Jan. 6 investigation, in which videos of those storming the U.S. Capitol helped the FBI identify many of the assailants and led federal prosecutors to charge more than 1,300 people. In those cases, investigators often were able to find social media images of the assailant wearing the same clothing as during the attack.\n\n\"Technology has made the entire community into the eyes of law enforcement,\" said retired Los Angeles police Capt. Paul Vernon, who led an effort after a mini-riot following the Lakers' NBA champion victory in 2010 that resulted in dozens of arrests based on videos, social media posts and security footage. \"Photo recognition has gotten a lot easier.\"\n\nVernon said an investigator also could gather cellphone data from the immediate area to prove an individual was there at the time of the incident. In some cases, assailants may have posted to their social media accounts, essentially bragging about their actions. Officers wearing body cameras may have also captured some of the behavior, he said.\n\nThe attackers likely came in vehicles, so UCLA police will be examining data from license plate readers for movements near campus early Wednesday. Security cameras on streets neighboring the campus where they likely parked could yield more clues.\n\nAlong with continuing protests, finding those who attacked the camp will be a major challenge for newly installed UCLA Associate Vice Chancellor Rick Braziel, a former Sacramento police chief. Braziel will be tasked with bringing to justice those responsible for what Chancellor Gene Block called a \"dark chapter in our campus history.\"\n\nDespite the technology, the probe faces hurdles. Some of the attackers wore masks, making it harder to identify them. In those instances, detectives will look for a moment before or after the attack when the perpetrators' faces were revealed, an official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly told The Times.\n\nThere is also deep anger among some protesters in the camp because it took so long for police to stop the attack. That distrust could take a toll. Many of the students who were injured, some of whom were hospitalized with their wounds, have gone to groups such as the Council on American Islamic Relations for Southern California but haven't spoken with campus police.\n\nUCLA is a small police department, so it is reaching out to other agencies and private entities to access the technology needed in the investigation, law enforcement sources said. But so far, UCLA hasn't made a public appeal seeking information on specific suspects.\n\nIn the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, the FBI made arrests based on information from relatives, work colleagues, teammates, former friends and ex-significant others after the FBI released photos of suspects. An army of web sleuths and politically knowledgeable social media watchers known as \"sedition hunters\" also dedicated themselves to identifying the mob and turning their names over to the FBI.\n\nImages from the UCLA attack are springing up on Instagram. In one case, a man can be seen using a plank to hit a pro-Palestinian protester and then punching and kicking others. Dressed in a black sweatshirt, white sweatpants and a black cap, his bearded face is not hidden. Police can use that image to track him or ask for help identifying him.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vernon, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vernon, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number-plate_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automatic number-plate recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American\u2013Islamic_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2a5657/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5668x3188+0+229/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F5a%2Fdfa63bca494bacea63611a0c3ab7%2F1442933-me-0501-ucla-protest-encampment-wjs014.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544486", "eventUri": "eng-9544486", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 789, "textEnd": 795, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The illegal encampment was allowed to sit on campus, grow, and eventually fortify, which escalated the force police would have to use when they eventually did get the green light to shut it down. It also escalated the tensions on campus and emboldened the terrorist-sympathizing \"pro-Palestinian\" protesters to harass students on campus, which fueled the response from counterprotesters in the first place.\n\nWhere does the buck stop? With no one, evidently. According to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, UCLA is \"not our jurisdiction\" because it's a state university, putting LAPD below university police and the California Highway Patrol in the pecking order. With respect to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), CHP says it responded after \"unacceptable\" delays and a limited response from university police. Either one or both of them were asleep at the wheel, or UCLA simply saw no urgency in removing the illegal encampment until it predictably escalated to violence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAll of this raises more questions than answers. Why did UCLA wait, if that is what Newsom is referring to, to ask for additional law enforcement assistance? Where were Bass and Newsom when the encampment was set up two weeks ago, and why were they not at the very least putting pressure on the university to nip it in the bud then? We had already seen protesters preventing students from moving around campus, and even impeding the movement of firefighters, before some counterprotesters took it upon themselves to try and dismantle the encampment.\n\nLeaving police to try and identify violent masked protesters who assaulted people to protect their illegal encampment means there likely will not be any true justice for it. The encampment should have never reached that point in the first place, and the fact that it did so reflects poorly on UCLA leadership, Bass, and Newsom, no matter what the specifics of their jurisdiction were.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_faria@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Zachary Faria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facial recognition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campus police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/UCLA.GettyImages-2150492118-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544486", "eventUri": "eng-9544486", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

In addition, this article contains four anonymous sources - Students A, B, C and D - who were granted anonymity for fear of retaliation from the university regarding their participation in the Palestine solidarity encampment.\n\nFor the Daily Bruin's full coverage on the UC Divest Coalition and Students for Justice in Palestine at UCLA encampment, see here.\n\nUCLA's campus echoed with screams and bangs amid violence.\n\n\"I'd seen something like I've never seen before and something that I never would expect to happen - not in the United States, not in California and certainly not in Los Angeles and on campus,\" said Ismael Sindha, an alumnus who was in the Palestine solidarity encampment at UCLA on April 30. \"I saw people bleeding from their heads. I saw people on the floor. I saw people crying.\"\n\nFrom late in the evening of April 30 to early May 1, the Palestine solidarity encampment in Dickson Plaza was attacked by more than 100 counter-protesters and aggressors who sprayed aerosol irritants, launched fireworks, tore away the encampment's barricades and hit those inside with metal poles and wooden planks. At 12:12 a.m. on May 1, UCLA released a statement that it had immediately called law enforcement to campus, but LAPD officers did not begin directing the aggressors out of the area until 3 a.m.\n\n\"At first, I could understand why there weren't police officers immediately,\" said Student A, who was in the encampment. \"But an hour in, and then two hours in, and then three hours in, it just reached the point where I was like, 'UCLA knows this is happening, and they don't care enough to protect their students.'\"\n\nStudent A, who arrived at the encampment around 10 p.m. April 30, said they helped individuals sprayed with the aerosol irritants and worked to fortify the encampment's barriers. They added that they saw student protesters who could not move, were unable to see, had difficulty breathing and had been physically beaten.\n\nFrom the encampment, Student A only saw some individuals throwing water bottles back at the aggressors, they said. They added that many other protesters said not to engage because it went against the encampment's purpose.\n\nStudent B, who was also in the encampment that night, said they felt Dickson Plaza had turned into a war zone as they watched the number of injured students increase.\n\n\"I heard some screaming, and I turned around, and one of my really good friends was on the floor rolling in agony,\" they said. \"I've never heard any of my friends scream like that before. ... It's still traumatizing until now, that I saw him go through that kind of pain.\"\n\nStudent C said they were hit in the head twice while trying to protect both the encampment's barricade and their fellow students. They said they were taken to the hospital by their classmates, where they ultimately received medical treatment, including stitches and staples.\n\n\"I thought I was going to die. I thought I'd never see my family again,\" they said. \"The only thing that kept me moving forward was my ... classmates who were brave enough to protect the encampment from these terrorists. The same classmates that courageously brought me back inside the encampment after my attack. The same classmates who I relied on to save my life.\"\n\nSindha, who briefly left the encampment to go to the hospital after a counter-protester sprayed him with an irritant, said he could still recall the threats the counter-protesters made against those in the encampment. He said these threats included, \"I'll kill you,\" \"I'll rape your sister\" and \"What Israel does to Gaza, we'll do to you.\"\n\nHe added that when he asked a security officer why security was not helping, he was told that what the encampment protesters were experiencing was their fault.\n\nFollowing Sindha's visit to the hospital, where he said he deferred treatment to those he felt needed it more, he returned to help protect the encampment. He said he quickly realized only the encampment protesters would protect themselves from the aggressors - who wore masks he likened to those in \"The Purge\" movies.\n\n\"Making the decision to come back was not an easy one, knowing that I was putting myself in danger again,\" Sindha said. \"But ultimately, in that situation, there was no other option for me - because how can I leave when I know people are being attacked violently?\"\n\nSindha said even days after the attack, he could still feel burning sensations from the aerosol irritant. Student D, who was also in the encampment, said being sprayed felt like experiencing a sunburn but \"1,000 times worse.\"\n\nStudent D also said they lost their vision for around an hour because of the irritant and were scared they would never be able to see again, adding that it was the worst pain they have ever felt.\n\nStudent B estimated that police were called more than 100 times throughout the night, both by people inside the encampment and concerned friends and family members. They added that the operators told callers the situation was under control and to only call if it was an emergency, hanging up on multiple people.\n\n\"You can't continue calling unless you have an emergency,\" said a UCPD operator in a recording of a phone call obtained by the Daily Bruin.\n\nThe following day, as students prepared for the police sweep of the encampment, many people were scared but doing anything they could to help, Student A said. At one point, they said students asked Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Darnell Hunt, who had entered the encampment earlier in the day to talk with the students, to stay with them - but he declined.\n\n\"Most people were just in disbelief that after everything that happened the night before, and after a majority of UCLA students were assaulted on their own campus by foreign entities, that the university would come and destroy our peaceful protest,\" Student A said. \"It was just really hard to wrap our minds around.\"\n\nMultiple students noted what they felt was a hypocritical response between the nights of April 30 and May 1 by the UCLA administration and police. No one was arrested the night of April 30 despite the violence by counter-protesters, but on the evening of May 1 and the morning of May 2, more than 200 encampment participants were detained in the police-led sweep of the encampment.\n\nSindha, who returned to the encampment May 1, said he spoke with a police officer who told him to go home. Following his response that the protesters were there to stay peacefully, he said the officer hit him in his stomach twice - which left a bruise days later.\n\nStudent D said they want to see better support for peaceful protests on campus.\n\n\"As an international student, I didn't expect to go to a new country and see something like that happen,\" they said. \"I thought (in) the USA, ... everybody gets to say what they want. But apparently they only get to say what they want if the police like it or if the government likes it or if Gene Block likes it.\"\n\nDespite the violence of the two nights, many of the students in the encampment said they would participate in and protect the encampment again.\n\n\"Unequivocally, yes,\" Student B said when asked whether they would behave the same as the night of April 30. \"I don't even have to think about that answer.\"\n\nMany students also said while the violence at UCLA was horrible, they want the focus to remain on what they were fighting for - UCLA's divestment from Israel and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"I had the luxury of getting sedated as they stapled my head back together. Currently, in Gaza, there are zero fully functioning hospitals,\" Student C said. \"The UCLA community deserves justice. The people of Gaza deserve justice.\"\n\nStudent B said they would never be able to forgive UCLA for the actions of the past week and that they wished the campus community had been able to see what the encampment was like before it was swept.\n\n\"I wish people had come inside the encampment before and seen what a beautiful environment it was. I was, the entire time, amazed by the beauty of our diversity, of how everybody was from different walks of life and different backgrounds,\" they said. \"We all united for this one cause.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailybruin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Bruin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerosol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Irritation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barricade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barricade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Bruin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Bruin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Students for Justice in Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darnell_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darnell Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

These guidelines remain in effect to this day. As detailed below, this guide calls into question the ongoing attempt by UCLA administrators to shift blame to law enforcement for the response/lack of response to protests at UCLA.\n\nThe lengthy 2014 plan resulted from eighteen months of deliberation by the UC system. It established \"a viable and fair set of best practices that preserve and promote the rights and responsibilities of free speech on the campuses, respond fairly and reasonably to civil disobedience when it occurs, and also provide safety and security to all the students, faculty, staff, and visitors on our campuses.\"\n\nCentral to these guidelines was the clear delineation of administrators' and campus law enforcement roles in managing civil disobedience incidents. The guidelines state that campus policy must \"require the participation of senior administrators in decision-making about any police response to civil disobedience; clearly define the respective roles of administrators (objectives) and police (tactics) in this process.\"\n\nMoreover, recognizing the pivotal role of campus administrators in protest response, the guidelines demanded that those administrators be well-trained in protest response. Specifically, the guidelines required UCLA to \"implement formal training of administrators . . . in the areas of crowd management, mediation, de-escalation techniques, the Incident Command System and police force options.\" This mandatory training was directed to be conducted annually, ensuring that current and best practices in protest response would be employed.\n\nThe guidelines extended beyond mere training of administrators, emphasizing the importance of joint simulations involving administrators and campus police to rehearse responses to potential civil disobedience scenarios. Additionally, campus police were to undergo crowd management and mediation training, with an explicit directive that the initial response be handled internally before seeking assistance from outside law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe role of UC police was emphasized, with officers trained in crowd management, mediation, and de-escalation. Additionally, the initial police response was restricted to campus police, with the additional directive that \"each campus police agency [is] to seek aid first from other UC campuses before calling on outside law enforcement.\"\n\nEvery UC campus was directed to establish a specialized response team to respond to major incidents on their campus and to respond to other campuses. Unfortunately, although those teams have been established, they have not been trained since 2020 because the UC system and its campuses refuse to fund such training.\n\nRecognizing that outside law enforcement might be called onto campus, the guidelines sought to ensure that it occurred as seamlessly as possible. To this end, training with outside law enforcement was mandated. Per the guidelines, UCLA was directed to create \"a regular program for joint trainings, briefings and scenario planning with law enforcement agencies on which each campus police department is likely to call for assistance or mutual aid.\"\n\nThe guidelines make clear that well before these protests, UCLA should have had in place trained administrators ready to implement specific, established, and well-rehearsed plans. Those plans should have covered in detail how both UCLA PD and any outside law enforcement would respond to civil disobedience on campus and who the senior administrators were who would make the call on when to execute any part of the plans.\n\nHowever, what unfolded at UCLA calls into question whether UCLA complied with the guidelines to have in place senior administrators trained in crowd control response, with written plans for response that were the product of scenario training and consultation with its police department and outside law enforcement agencies. The response to protests appears ad hoc and devoid of the structured planning mandated by the UC system.\n\nIf this is not the case, then it should be easy for the UCLA administration to identify those administrators who undertook the required annual training in crowd management and response. UCLA can simply produce the plans developed before these protests, which guided their response, and demonstrate how the response dovetailed with those plans. Finally, the UCLA administration can also show how it met the required training, briefing, and scenario planning that it was ordered to undertake both with its own police department and outside agencies prior to these protests.\n\nAny failure to do so will lay bare that the response to date by the UCLA administration to the protest fallout is nothing more than a furious attempt to shift blame for its failures onto law enforcement.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campus police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil disobedience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crowd control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutual aid (organization theory)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ad hoc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Government Agencies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Public_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Public Administration", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LDN-L-PROTESTS-UCLA-0503-DC-7-2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544486", "eventUri": "eng-9544486", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Forty-two of them were arrested for conspiracy to commit a crime and two for obstructing a peace officer. Four members of the group had also been previously arrested for failing to disperse when authorities cleared the encampments on May 2.\n\nThe police statement does not indicate what cause the group was supporting but there have been ongoing pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus, and at least one night of clashes involving counter-protest groups.\n\n43 protesters arrested at UCLA, as school shifts classes to remote for the week\n\nThe arrests - and two related incidents nearby - unfolded just before 6 a.m. Monday.\n\nPolice were notified of a large group of people at the school's Parking Structure 2. When campus police showed up, they found a group of about 40 people who were wearing masks and carrying metal pipes.\n\nAfter detaining the group with zip ties, officers discovered they were in possession of various tools, including heavy-duty metal pipes, bolt cutters, epoxy adhesive, super glue, padlocks, heavy-duty chains and \"documentation encouraging violence and vandalism.\"\n\nPolice say the group had formed a plan to break into and occupy Moore Hall.\n\nAs the group was being detained, there was another group of about 30 people already inside Moore Hall and police discovered that a UCLA student group was calling for people to occupy the building. Police repeatedly announced the building was closed and everyone inside had to leave and eventually, roughly 60 people exited the building.\n\nIt is believed the same group then marched to Dodd Hall later that morning and created a disturbance that interrupted midterm exams. More protesters were outside and eventually they all marched to Bruin Plaza and eventually scattered.\n\nAfter the arrests, which came after days of turmoil on campus, the school declared all classes would shift to remote learning for the week. Students had been preparing for midterms.\n\nRoyce Hall and Powell Library would remain closed for the week.\n\n\"Due to ongoing disruption, the campus has returned to limited operational status,\" the school announced in a BruinAlert. \"Therefore, per Senate guidance, classes will move remote May 6-10.

Young Research Library at 11 a.m., followed a letter that received over 800 signatures in 48 hours from UC faculty.\n\nIn the letter, faculty demanded that Chancellor Block resign immediately, all legal charges dropped with full amnesty for all students, staff and faculty, and full disclosure of all UCLA investments. The letter also called for divestment from military weapons companies and supporting systems.\n\nIn a different letter May 1 that has since garnered nearly 1,100 signatures, UC faculty condemned the university's lack of action during the April 30 attack on the Palestine solidarity encampment and called on it to not mobilize police against students protesting inside. Following the police sweep of the encampment May 2, departments and institutes have condemned the university's choice, and some have called for Chancellor Gene Block to step down.\n\n[Related: UCLA academic departments release statements condemning handling of encampment]\n\nSince the encampment sweep, as well as UCPD arresting 44 pro-Palestine protesters at Parking Structure 2 on Monday morning, classes have been moved online for the entirety of the week.\n\nMembers of UAW Local 4811, which represents the University of California academic student employees, graduate students, academic and postdoctoral researchers, will be voting May 13-15 on whether or not to go on strike. If the vote goes through, academic senate faculty members will not perform any struck labor through the rest of the quarter, said Matt Barreto - a professor of Chicana/o studies and political science - during the conference.\n\nSeveral medics who were inside the encampment said they provided urgent care and triage for students, faculty and community members during both the attack and police sweep. A medic said it was chilling to watch police officers fire rubber bullets at students.\n\nAt least 15 encampment members required emergency services, and most were taken to emergency rooms in private vehicles, the medic said.\n\n\"Had we not been present to administer this essential care, would EMS and law enforcement have left these injured people to die?\" they said.\n\nRepresentatives from various departments read statements from during the press conference. Erin Debenport, associate director of the American Indian Studies Center, read the center's statement published Friday. The nine faculty who signed the statement said they are committed to free speech and the right to nonviolent protest without fear of retaliation.\n\nNatalie Masuoka an associate professor of Asian American studies and political science, said the Asian American studies department denounces Block's decision to call LAPD, California Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department to disband the encampment.\n\nAlden Young, vice chair of the Department of African American studies, said his department also rejects Chancellor Block's creation of an Office of Campus Security, which he said the UCLA Academic Senate did not consent to.\n\nSusan Slyomovics, an anthropology and Near Eastern languages professor who is Jewish, said Block misrepresented Jewish students in his statements on campus antisemitism and dismantling the encampment. In one statement April 30, Block said the tactics used by both protesters and counter-protesters put many students, including Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.\n\n\"He has spoken of his concerns about the fears experienced by Jewish students and drawn a supposed connection between addressing campus antisemitism and dismantling the encampment of Palestine solidarity in front of Royce Hall,\" Slyomovics said. \"In doing so, he has misused Jews.\"\n\nAfter faculty members read their statements, Barreto read faculty demands and said that they are evaluating the possibility of withholding labor until UCLA meets them.\n\nIn a letter distributed at the conference, faculty requested that California Attorney General Rob Bonta open an independent investigation into the actions of UCLA administration as well as actions of UCPD, LAPD and CHP, in addition to the current investigation from Chief Safety Officer Rick Braziel.\n\nThe letter also called for the UC to provide a financial and health care assistance fund for students who needed medical assistance or who had to replace lost valuables after the encampment sweep.\n\nFaculty members then marched to Murphy Hall to deliver their letter to Block. They chanted slogans such as, \"One, two, three, four, Gene Block, you're out the door. Five, six, seven, eight, amnesty, it cannot wait.\"\n\nBarreto said that the UCLA Academic Senate's legislative assembly will host a vote of no confidence in Block this week, which would determine if Block is fit to continue occupying his chancellor position.\n\nWhen the group arrived at Murphy Hall, APEX Security - a security firm hired by UCLA - blocked members from entering and refused to accept the letter.\n\nIn an interview with The Bruin, Young said faculty were not informed that Murphy Hall would be closed. He added that he also saw a student outside the rally attempt to enter the building from the door facing Dickson Court, but the student was not told an alternative route.\n\n\"The university administration's declaration of the peaceful student protesters as unlawful and unauthorized spurred violence, alongside repressive tactics, that created an environment of fear and distress for our community,\" Young said at the press conference.", "source": {"uri": "dailybruin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Bruin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

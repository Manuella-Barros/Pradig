The actress' breakthrough into mainstream Hollywood came at the age of 15 with her role as Laura, also known as X-23, in Marvel Comics' Logan. Dafne, whose parents are both actors, also starred as Lyra Belacqua in the BBC's His Dark Materials, which is set in a parallel world where the iconic orphan tries to stop chaos spilling into the universe. However, the celebrated star seems to have put her childhood roles behind her after posing for a number of sultry snaps on Instagram. Sporting red stilettos, a red mini dress, one stocking, sipping a glass of champagne, the actress looks a world away from tomboy, Lyra. Commenting on the photos, fans couldn't believe how much Dafne had grown up, as one commented: \"That's the little girl from Logan? Time flies\" Another said: \"Can't believe how different she looks!\" While another exclaimed: \"No way that's Lyra!\" Dafne began acting when she just nine years old. Coming from a showbiz family, she made her debut in the Spanish TV show The Refugees (Refugiados). She is the daughter of British actor Will Keen, who starred in The Crown and Wolf Hall and her mum is Spanish actress, theatre director and writer, Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Ache. Two years after her screen debut The Refugees, and after several auditions, Madrid-born Dafne was cast by 20th Century Fox in the 2017 superhero film Logan, which she co-starred with Hugh Jackman. The film, which opened to critical and financial success, and is considered to be one of the best superhero movies of all time, earned Dafne several awards and nominations for her performance, which include winning an Empire Award for Best Newcomer. In 2019, the actress was cast in the lead role of Lyra Belacqua in the BBC/HBO television adaptation of the His Dark Materials trilogy, where she co-stars along with actress, Ruth Wilson. Dafne's dad is also a cast member of the series, playing Lyra's nemesis, Father MacPhail. The series won Dafne more praise and a nomination for BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Actress in 2020. The same year, the actress starred alongside Andy Garc\u00eda in the comedy-drama film Ana. The film was originally announced in 2017, but was delayed until 2020. In 2022, Dafne's talents were noted again when it was announced she had bagged a role in the Star Wars series, The Acolyte.

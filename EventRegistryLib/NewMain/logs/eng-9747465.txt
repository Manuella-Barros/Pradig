England Boss | HowAfrica Latest news, views, gossip, photos and video", "body": "The Football Association has identified a \"number of candidates\" to succeed Gareth Southgate as they look for an England manager capable of \"winning a major tournament\".\n\nSouthgate resigned on Tuesday following England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe conclusion of Southgate's eight-year rule prompted the FA to conduct a selection hunt, which saw them associated with a number of contenders.\n\nAmong the bookmakers' favourites are Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, former Chelsea bosses Graham Potter, Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel, and Tottenham coach Ange Postecoglou.\n\nHowever, the FA insists that the process is open to anyone who meets the criteria published on Friday in a job profile detailing the qualities required of the next England manager.\n\nThe text of the role profile stated: \"Our succession planning process has already identified a number of candidates; in addition to this we are committed to open recruitment processes in the football industry.\"\n\nWhile Southgate received plaudits for repairing England's tarnished reputation, he was unable to end the country's wait for its first major prize since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nFollowing consecutive European Championship final disappointments and a 2018 World Cup semi-final loss, Southgate's successor's primary aim is undoubtedly to win a major trophy with a group brimming with world-class quality.\n\nThe FA stated that they are searching for a manager who can \"lead and develop the England senior men's team to win a major tournament and be consistently ranked as one of the top teams in the world\".\n\nThe chosen person would also provide \"inspiring leadership\" to the FA's technical team, as well as build and maintain solid ties with clubs that hire English-qualified players.\n\nThe winning applicant would need to have a UEFA Pro Licence, \"significant experience\" in English football, and \"a strong track record delivering results in the Premier League and/or leading international competitions\".\n\nThe FA emphasized the need for a \"exceptional leader,\" \"highly resilient,\" and \"comfortable in a very high-profile role with intense public scrutiny\" in a direct reference to the criticism Southgate received during his tenure in a role once dubbed the \"impossible job\" by then-England manager Graham Taylor.\n\nThe FA, which promotes equality, diversity, and inclusion, welcomes applications from anybody who fits the criteria.\n\nSarina Wiegman, who guided England to

candidates.\n\nThe Football Association have identified a \"number of candidates\" to replace Gareth Southgate as they search for an England manager capable of \"winning a major tournament\".\n\nSouthgate resigned on Tuesday in the aftermath of England's Euro 2024 final defeat against Spain.\n\nThe end of Southgate's eight-year reign has forced the FA into a selection search that has seen them linked with a host of candidates.\n\nAmong the bookmakers' favourites are Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, former Chelsea bosses Graham Potter, Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel, as well as Tottenham coach Ange Postecoglou.\n\nHowever, the FA insist the process is open to anyone who meets the criteria it published on Friday in a job profile detailing the qualities required in the next England manager.\n\nThe text of the role profile stated: \"Our succession planning process has already identified a number of candidates; in addition to this we are committed to open recruitment processes in the football industry.\"\n\nALSO READ: Manchester United sign French teen Leny Yoro on a five-year contract ahead of Premier League 2024-25\n\nWhile Southgate earned plaudits for restoring England's tarnished reputation, he failed to end the country's wait for a first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nAfter successive European Championship final defeats and a 2018 World Cup semi-final loss, finally winning a major prize with a squad packed with world-class talent is clearly the top priority for Southgate's successor.\n\nThe FA said they are looking for a manager able to \"lead and develop the England senior men's team to win a major tournament and be consistently ranked as one of the top teams in the world\".\n\nThe right person would also provide \"inspiring leadership\" to the FA's technical team and develop and maintain strong relationships with clubs who employ English-qualified players.\n\nThe successful candidate would need to hold a UEFA Pro Licence, possess \"significant experience\" of English football and have \"a strong track record delivering results in the Premier League and/or leading international competitions\".\n\nIn a pointed reference to the criticism Southgate endured during his time in a role once dubbed the \"impossible job\" by then England boss Graham Taylor, the FA highlighted the need for an \"exceptional leader\", \"highly resilient\" and \"comfortable in a very high-profile role with intense public scrutiny\".\n\nPromoting equality, diversity and inclusion, the FA welcomed applications from everyone who meets the criteria.\n\nEngland Women's coach Sarina Wiegman, who led the team to victory at the Women's European Championship in 2022, has been linked with replacing Southgate.\n\nThe profile includes an email address for interested applicants, potentially opening the way for the FA to be deluged with offers from fans rather than genuine candidates.\n\nThe governing body has set August 2 as the closing date for applications.\n\nEngland's first match of the new season is a Nations League clash with the Republic of Ireland on September 7.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType":

Gareth Southgate as England Boss - TV360 Nigeria", "body": "The Football Association have identified a \"number of candidates\" to replace Gareth Southgate as they search for an England manager capable of \"winning a major tournament\".\n\nSouthgate resigned on Tuesday in the aftermath of England's EURO 2024 final defeat against Spain.\n\nThe end of Southgate's eight-year reign has forced the FA into a selection search that has seen them linked with a host of candidates.\n\nAmong the bookmakers' favorites are Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, former Chelsea bosses Graham Potter, Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel, as well as Tottenham coach Ange Postecoglou.\n\nHowever, the FA insist the process is open to anyone who meets the criteria it published on Friday in a job profile detailing the qualities required in the next England manager.\n\nThe text of the role profile stated: \"Our succession planning process has already identified a number of candidates; in addition to this we are committed to open recruitment processes in the football industry.\"\n\nWhile Southgate earned plaudits for restoring England's tarnished reputation, he failed to end the country's wait for a first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nAfter successive European Championship final defeats and a 2018 World Cup semi-final loss, finally winning a major prize with a squad packed with world-class talent is clearly the top priority for Southgate's successor.\n\nThe FA said they are looking for a manager able to \"lead and develop the England senior men's team to win a major tournament and be consistently ranked as one of the top teams in the world\".\n\nThe right person would also provide \"inspiring leadership\" to the FA's technical team and develop and maintain strong relationships with clubs that employ English-qualified players.\n\nThe successful candidate would need to hold a UEFA Pro Licence, possess \"significant experience\" of English football and have \"a strong track record delivering results in the Premier League and/or leading international competitions\".\n\nIn a pointed reference to the criticism Southgate endured during his time in a role once dubbed the \"impossible job\" by then England boss Graham Taylor, the FA highlighted the need for an \"exceptional leader\", \"highly resilient\" and \"comfortable in a very high-profile role with intense public scrutiny\".", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV360 Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "comfort_samuel@tv360nigeria.com", "name": "Comfort Samuel",

"title": "Man United 'make Gareth Southgate decision' after England resignation", "body": "Manchester United supposedly have no plans to replace Erik ten Hag with Gareth Southgate, even if they endure a woeful start to the 2024-25 season.\n\nyou have updates\n\nManchester United have reportedly come to a decision on whether they will pursue Gareth Southgate if things go awry under Erik ten Hag at the start of next season.\n\nThe former England head coach is officially on the managerial market after ending an eight-year spell as Three Lions head coach, where he led the nation to two Euros finals and a World Cup semi-final.\n\nHowever, Southgate failed in his mission to win England's first trophy in senior men's football since the 1966 World Cup, suffering Euros heartbreak to Italy in 2020 and Spain earlier this month.\n\nJust two days after England suffered a 2-1 loss to Spain in Berlin, Southgate announced that he was ceding control of the England reins, triggering a media frenzy over who could succeed him.\n\nWhile Southgate was in the final months of his England tenure, speculation raged that he could potentially replace Ten Hag at Man United when it appeared that the Dutchman would be given the boot this summer.\n\nMan United 'highly unlikely' to pursue Southgate\n\nTen Hag led Man United to their worst-ever Premier League finish last season and also oversaw a disastrous Champions League campaign, where the Red Devils finished bottom of their group.\n\nHowever, the 20-time English champions upset Manchester City 2-1 to win the FA Cup, and following talks with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS team, Ten Hag was ultimately given a contract extension.\n\nAs a result, the Daily Mail claims that Man United are 'highly unlikely' to make a move for Southgate as their new head coach, even if they endure a horrendous start to the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nThe powers-that-be at Old Trafford are supposedly throwing all their weight behind the ex-Ajax boss, whom they have supported in the transfer market with the captures of Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nFurthermore, even if Ratcliffe did decide to bite the bullet and fire Ten Hag, Southgate is supposedly not even the primary candidate to succeed him; that honour belongs to Thomas Tuchel.\n\nTuchel - who left Bayern Munich this summer - spoke with the Man United hierarchy earlier this year, but he came to the conclusion that he needed a complete break from management for a while.\n\nWho could replace Southgate as England boss?\n\nWhile it is far from clear where Southgate could end up after ending his England career, the FA are not short of candidates to replace him, as they stressed when posting the head coach vacancy on their official website.\n\nFormer Chelsea managers Mauricio Pochettino and Graham Potter are said to be two of the top contenders, as is Newcastle United's Eddie Howe, but the Magpies have no intention of parting ways with him.\n\nUnder-21s boss Lee Carsley could also earn promotion to the senior role and therefore follow the same path as Southgate, and it has also been suggested that the FA could wait for Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to become available.\n\nThe ex-Barcelona coach is expected to leave the Premier League champions when his deal runs out in 2025, and the governing body may choose to appoint an interim boss - potentially Carsley - for the next year before pursuing Guardiola.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He's young, he's ambitious and he's been doing a very good job during his time as a club manager. O'Neil has also had a better club record than Gareth Southgate. The Wolves manager kept Bournemouth in the Premier League.\n\nThen he was let go by The Cherries but dusted himself down, took on a tough job at Wolves and excelled again. The Black Country club may have tailed off towards the end of last season in terms of results. But he took the job late in the summer knowing it was a tight budget after Julen Lopetegui walked out because of the purse strings.\n\nREAD MORE: Gareth Southgate set for career change as he sparks bidding war from global firms\n\nREAD MORE: 'World's hottest football WAG' wows in see-through red dress to launch Playboy deal\n\nO'Neil got them playing attractive football and ensured there was a strong team spirit so they could punch above their weight. Relegation was never a worry. He makes a lot of sense if England want a manager who can play more attractive football than Southgate but match the now-former Three Lions boss in terms of team building and lack of ego.\n\nO'Neil deserves at the very least the chance to put forward his case in front of the FA board. He's worked his way up the coaching ladder from being an assistant boss at Liverpool's U23s to becoming a Premier League boss. He doesn't have bundles of experience but neither did Southgate.\n\nDo you think Gary O'Neil would be a shrewd appointment by England? Let us know in the comments section below\n\nSurely the FA won't be able to afford to go for a glamour manager like Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola. Those bosses command salaries north of \u00a315m a year. The FA would have to cut grassroots funding and more to splurge that much on a national senior men's manager.\n\nSouthgate has now moved on and it was the right call from him to walk away now.\n\nIt will be a tough job to replace him even though he didn't win any trophies because England got so far in tournaments. The new manager will be dreaming of getting such favourable draws. But if the FA go down the route of young, English managers then O'Neil has to be on the shortlist.\n\nIt has only been a week since the football actually stopped and the transfer window has taken over. As journalists and media companies, we crave these stories. They sell papers and drive numbers online so the pressure is on to get stories and rightly so.\n\nBut the incessant discussions online about 'winning the transfer window' and celebrating signings is hard to stomach. You get the feeling that some fans despise the actual football getting in the way of all this transfer success.\n\nThis week Manchester United fans were parading around Lenny Yoro as some sort of trophy. While rival supporters were busy spending time finding clips of the 18-year-old defender making mistakes to claim he is a waste of money.\n\nHow about we just count down the days until the actual football starts again instead of spending every waking hour worrying if you've signed the next Raphael Varane or William Prunier.\n\nONSIDE\n\nLuka Modric. Another year at Real Madrid, another year for us to see a midfield master play.\n\nOFFSIDE\n\nEnzo Fernandez and Argentina. Do we really need to say more?

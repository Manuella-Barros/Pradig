In Phase 1 of the project, the team were able to go from sampling to coral microbiome analysis within 72 hours, with all work done by Bermudians in Bermuda. \u201cFor Phase 2 of the project, BioQuest was able to sequence the whole genome of the coral for the first time during the Roche Science Week at Bermuda College in February. The assembly of the draft reference genome was done by Professor Miten Jain, Principal Investigator of the Genome Technology Laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cThis technological feat leverages the advanced capabilities of Seq2Know, the sole Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT] certified sequencing laboratory in the LATAM & Caribbean region, run by CariGenetics. \u201cThe Grooved Brain Coral [Diploria labyrinthiformis], a large, reef-building coral that lives throughout the Caribbean Sea and its adjacent waters, is currently classified as critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List. BioQuest\u2019s efforts are pivotal in the conservation of this species, creating a vital resource for any future genetics work that will contribute to its preservation.\u201d Jean-Pierre Rouja, Executive Director of BioQuest, remarked, \u201cCompleting the coral reference genome represents a monumental achievement in our efforts to conserve marine biodiversity. This project underscores our commitment to build local capacity whilst using advanced genetic tools to understand and protect endangered species within our oceans.\u201d Dr Carika Weldon, CEO and Founder of CariGenetics, and Director of Research of BioQuest, expressed her enthusiasm for the project\u2019s success: \u201cWe are breaking new ground in Caribbean marine conservation and providing invaluable insights that will aid in the protection of endangered species. Completing this project without having to send any samples away is a testament to the incredible dedication and expertise of our team. By harnessing the power of genomic sequencing, we are excited to continue this journey with our esteemed partners and contribute to global conservation efforts.\u201d The spokesperson said, \u201cBioQuest also extends its congratulations to the Nonsuch Expeditions on being awarded the prestigious Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund Chairman\u2019s Award. Part of this grant will enable the Nonsuch Expeditions, the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources, and BioQuest to continue the Bermuda Cahow Genome Project. One of the rarest seabirds in the world, the Bermuda cahow is listed as critically endangered by IUCN Red List and can only be found in Bermuda. \u201cWith Phase 1 completed in April 2023 with the draft reference genome, the next phase of the project launches the first ever Bermuda cahow population genomics study. Scientists will be better able to assess the level of genetic diversity and have the ability to track this over successive generations. It will also provide some insight to the current nesting pair failure that is being experienced by some and may help overcome this hurdle to allow the population to flourish to no longer be critically endangered. \u201cSequencing the Grooved Brain Coral\u2019s reference genome sets a significant precedent in the region, showcasing the potential of local scientific initiatives, driven by local teams, to make impactful contributions to global biodiversity conservation. BioQuest proudly joins the international community in continuing the fight to save our oceans.

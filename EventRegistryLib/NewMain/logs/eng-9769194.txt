Van den Berg has been at Liverpool for five years now, although he has only made four senior appearances for the club in that time.\n\nHe has spent much of the last few years away on loan, including a spell at German club Mainz last season where he played 35 times. The Bundesliga side has been linked with a permanent move, although nothing appears to be forthcoming.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool transfer news LIVE: Joao Neves deal, Sepp van den Berg latest, Anthony Gordon update\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot agrees with Jurgen Klopp on Liverpool star who needs 'more time' after Real Betis win\n\nFurthermore, Arne Slot looks to be keen to take a closer look at Van den Berg in action during pre-season. The defender has started both friendlies so far against Preston and Real Betis, and will likely get more time against Arsenal and Manchester United during the tour of the United States.\n\nThat has led to Van den Berg softening his stance somewhat, and he seems to have left the door open on staying with Liverpool - as long as he gets more opportunities.\n\n\"I'm still a Liverpool player. I enjoy it here, really,\" he told Sky Sports following the win over Real Betis. \"It's been a very nice pre-season. Of course, new coach, like new era starts, fresh training, new style of play. I really like it.\n\n\"For me, it's just about game time and, at the moment, I'm getting it here. So I'm happy at the moment, but like I said, it's still early. You never know what can happen, but for me the most important thing is playing.\n\n\"If I can do it here, there's no better place. It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest, clubs in the world, so if it's here, it's my dream. But for me, the most important thing is playing, so I will see what happens.\"\n\nVan den Berg added: \"At a club like this, at this level, you have to be patient. I've been here now for five years, time flies.\n\n\"Of course, I've been away [on loan] quite a lot, but for me they were perfect steps, gaining experience.\n\n\"I've played a lot of games in the last few years, especially at center-back. I came here very, very young, so for me to go out a few times, it was perfect.\n\n\"Now to be here, feeling ready, feeling good. I think it was very good.\"\n\nLiverpool.com says: It will be interesting to see what becomes of Van den Berg's future this summer. Clearly, he will get his chance in the US, but with Ibrahima Konate set to return soon, and Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez to follow back on Merseyside, you'd expect him to drop back down the pecking order. He'll need to really impress against Arsenal and Manchester United if he's to have any chance of holding down his spot.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_findlater@liverpool.com", "name": "James Findlater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Neves", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Neves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article29624528.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-2163857694.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

their Dutch connections, and it has not come as a surprise to see the defender involved in the USA.\n\nHowever, it could be argued that Van den Berg is only earning his opportunities thanks to the absences of Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk, who were given more time off to recover from their Euro 2024 exploits.\n\nKonate has now arrived in the USA fit and raring to go, while Van Dijk's return is not too far away either, and Van den Berg will also have to compete with Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah next season as things stand.\n\nThe 22-year-old has no doubt blossomed into a competent top-level European defender, but if it is weekly starts he is after, Anfield is unlikely to be the place for him.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

The 6ft 4in defender also grabbed himself three goals over the course of the season, including one away to Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAs things stand, Van den Berg remains open to a departure away from Liverpool in order to secure regular first-team football and PSV is currently the most serious team in the race.

The defender played 63 minutes of Liverpool's 1-0 friendly win against Real Betis on Friday and performed well, completing more passes (80) than any other player on the pitch while also making five recoveries, two interceptions and one tackle.\n\nCan he do enough to impress new boss and compatriot Slot?\n\n\"I'm still a Liverpool player. I enjoy it here, really. Like I said it's been a very nice pre-season, a new coach, a new era starts, fresh training, a new style of play, so I really like it,\" Van den Berg said when asked about his future following the Betis game (via Liverpoolfc.com).\n\n\"Like I said, for me it's just about game time and at the moment I am getting it here so I'm happy. It's still early, you never know what can happen, but for me the most important thing is playing.\n\n\"If I can do it here there's no better place, it's one of the biggest clubs - if not the biggest - in the world so if it is here it is my dream. But for me, the most important thing is to play so we will see what happens.\"\n\nLiverpool have two more matches in the United States against Arsenal and Manchester United before they return to Anfield for one final test against Sevilla.\n\nVan den Berg, of course, hopes to play a big part in those matches -- especially against Premier League rivals Arsenal and Man Utd -- but appreciates there's a level of 'patience' required when it comes to a club like Liverpool.\n\n\"I played 45 minutes in the first game [a behind-closed-doors match against Preston], 60 in this one and I hope to make more minutes in the next two games,\" Van den Berg added.\n\n\"For me, it's perfect. I can show myself in training [and] in the games, get game time, get rhythm, so it's been very good.\n\n\"At a club like this, at this level, you have to be patient. I've been here now already for five years, time flies!

'I know in today's market (high prices) will happen,' he said. 'For the price they want for me, hmmm...\n\n'Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325million that is a lot more. Hopefully we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! It is also a compliment. But it makes it difficult, \u00a320m is majorly high.'\n\nSepp Van den Berg (right) admits he was surprised that his asking price was as high as \u00a320-25m\n\nThe Dutch defender has featured heavily in Liverpool's pre-season friendlies so far this summer\n\nLiverpool's valuation - as it is for all players - is based on other transactions around Europe this summer. The club saw Bournemouth set to sign Juventus defender Dean Huijsen for \u00a312.6m plus add-ons after making just nine Serie A appearances.\n\nVan den Berg, meanwhile, has played nearly 150 times in decent leagues. Likewise, Southampton paid \u00a320m for Manchester City kid Taylor Harwood-Bellis after two decent seasons in the Championship. The Reds, therefore, believe \u00a320m for Van den Berg is fair.\n\nThe 22-year-old is not in any rush to leave Anfield, though. He played in both of Liverpool's friendlies so far, including former club Preston and a win over Spanish side Real Betis in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He put in a solid shift in both outings.\n\n'I spoke with (Slot) on my first day,' added Van den Berg. 'He said to me I have to show myself in pre-season. I had my own visions, I want to play. We will see what happens. But I am happy here. My goal is to play football next year so we will see if it is here or somewhere else.\n\nVan den Berg insisted that although his future is up in the air he is more than willing to stay and work for a place in the side\n\nHe was the Bundesliga's highest-rated defender while on loan at Mainz last season, according to WhoScored\n\n'Of course, I am here now. Liverpool is one of the biggest, if not the biggest club in the world. It has always been my dream. I am here to show myself I am Liverpool worthy. If he gives me a chance and likes me, there's a big chance of me staying.\n\n'But we are still early in the window, we will see. I was a boy when I came here, 17. I have done one and a half years in the Championship, two years in the Bundesliga. I am still young but I feel very old! It's about game time and experience.

Essentially, the Reds are just waiting to get back from their preseason tour of the US.\n\nVan den Berg has a role to play until then, with certain players still missing after the international tournaments.

It's a positive start if he does want to secure a place in Liverpool's squad but it's not entirely clear that Van den Berg wants that.\n\nHe's voiced concerns that Liverpool are overvaluing him in talks with other clubs. At the end of the day, Van den Berg wants to play regular football somewhere and knows his chances of that at Anfield are slim.\n\nEspecially when Liverpool are open to selling him.\n\n\"The case of Sepp van den Berg [to PSV], it will not become topical again until next week at the earliest,\" Elfrink wrote on X. \"This week he and his club will first complete the 'Preseason Tour' in the United States. Liverpool are not moving now.\"\n\nPSV Eindhoven did make a late offer for Van den Berg before Liverpool set off for North America. The BBC claim that offer was just \u00a38.4m, however - a long, long way short of the \u00a320m the Reds are after.\n\nIt's a difficult price for clubs like PSV to pay and it's clubs of that stature that can offer Van den Berg what he wants. At the same time, Liverpool would absolutely expect to pay \u00a320m to sign a young defender who performed brilliantly in the Bundesliga.\n\nWe'll see who's more likely to budge next week, then. Liverpool will lower their price if there's no real room for Van den Berg in the squad but if they believe they can use him, PSV will need to find \u00a320m.\n\nFrom Klopp CHAOS to Arne Slot CONTROL - Liverpool match-winner Dominik Szoboszlai is set to be unleashed6 hours agoby Henry Jackson\n\nLiverpool fans want club to ACCEPT offers for 'special' talent - poll results19 hours agoby Alex Caple", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RJoS0pvKTRwXV3mVvCD.wg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Nzc-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/anfield_watch_articles_625/61e89119185aa10349a3b3c508ab9198", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

As a quiet July nears its end, with only two loan outgoings completed to date, his prediction is about to be put to the test.\n\nWith Euro 2024 and the Copa America both taking place, along with Slot's arrival, the Reds were always going to have to be patient as the Dutchman assessed his inherited squad.\n\nBut while no surprise that Liverpool are yet to add to their squad this summer, it has been a busy 48 hours on the transfer front as possible Reds moves start to emerge.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool reject Sepp van den Berg bid after transfer value verdict shared\n\nREAD MORE: Mohamed Salah sends wordless message that says everything about Liverpool mood under Arne Slot\n\nOn Saturday, it emerged that Ben Doak was subject of loan interest from the likes of Leicester City and Southampton, and could move on temporarily following the club's pre-season tour of the United States. Meanwhile, on Sunday news broke that Liverpool had rejected an \u00a311.8m bid from Marseille from Wataru Endo.\n\nAnd on Monday, word of another rejected bid emerged as the ECHO reported that PSV Eindhoven had been knocked back in their initial efforts to sign Sepp van den Berg. An offer of roughly \u00a310m falls considerably short of their \u00a320m asking price.\n\nWhile moves for Doak and Endo were somewhat left-field, it would be little surprise if Van den Berg moved on this summer. After all, following an eye-catching loan at Mainz 05 last season, he had already admitted that he would like to move on.\n\nSuch a stance has softened publicly, at least, given the fact that the Dutchman is said to be impressing behind the scenes in pre-season and has started the summer in Slot's starting XI. Consequently, while he still disputes the Reds' asking price, he has confirmed he would be happy to stay put if given a chance to play.\n\n\"I know in today's market [high prices] will happen,\" Van den Berg said after starting last week's victory over Real Betis. \"For the price they want for me, hmmm...Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325million, that is a lot more. Hopefully we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! But it is also a compliment.\n\n\"For me, it is about playing time. If I get it here, there is no better place to be. Of course, [the price tag] is a compliment. But it makes it difficult. \u00a320m is majorly high.\n\n\"Of course, I am here now. Liverpool is one of the biggest, if not the biggest club in the world. It has always been my dream. I am here to show myself I am Liverpool worthy. If he gives me a chance and likes me, there's a big chance of me staying. But we are still early in the window so we will see.\n\n\"I spoke with [Slot] on my first day. He said to me, I have to show myself in pre-season. I had my own visions, I want to play. We will see what happens. But I am happy here. My goal is to play football next year so we will see if it is here or somewhere else.\n\n\"For a centre back you need experience of being in the rhythm of playing every game. That's where I made the biggest steps. In terms of the training and environment here, you can't get any better. But when I was away, I played every game and made bigger steps.\n\n\"I am a better player now than when I joined, of course. I was a boy when I came here, 17. I have done one and a half years in the Championship, two years Bundesliga now, I have been around some clubs. I am still young but I feel very old. It's just about game time and experience.\"\n\nYet while Van den Berg started against Betis, and is likely to keep his place for the rest of the US tour, his place in Slot's pecking order will be tested beyond that. And reading between the lines, it appears he is already well-aware of such a fact.\n\nIbrahima Konate will link up with the Liverpool first team in the United States later this week, while Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez aren't due back until after the Reds' return to Merseyside. And their returns could well close the door on his desire for regular game-time.\n\nIn truth, the trio's ongoing absence is part of the reason why his long-term future remains unresolved, with Mainz sporting director Christian Heidel previously admitting it had contributed to protracted transfer negotiations with Liverpool and a need for patience.\n\n\"It's difficult, I can't do that,\" he told Sky Germany at the start of July when asked negotiations might get moving again. \"We're waiting. We've been in contact with Liverpool several times.\n\n\"When Liverpool starts training, there won't be a central defender there because they're all spread out at the European Championships and the Copa America and then they want to take a look and take their time.\n\n\"Sepp has made it clear that he would really like to stay in Mainz. We would really like to keep him, now Liverpool have to play along too. We're giving Liverpool the time and we're taking the time.\"\n\nA month on and the Reds are close to welcoming back their senior centre-backs. Just days after Slot had confirmed Konate's imminent return, news of PSV testing Liverpool's resolve for Van den Berg broke.\n\nWhile the Eredivisie outfit's bid was rejected, the 22-year-old's future isn't resolved yet. Supporters might be focused on incoming transfers, but it concerns outgoings too with Hughes' predicted August transfer 'crescendo' on the verge of getting underway.\n\n\"It would be a surprise for all of us I think if we don't bring any player in, so that will probably happen in the end,\" Slot admitted after Liverpool's win over Real Betis. \"But for now, we are just waiting for the players to come back and waiting for the right ones to sign.\"\n\nSuch returns will also open up the door to possible exits. Van den Berg remains a Reds player for now after the latest rejected bid, but his Liverpool future is about to become a lot clearer as the club's transfer business heats up.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "theo_squires@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Theo Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_de_Marseille", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympique de Marseille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._FSV_Mainz_05", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1._FSV_Mainz_05"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29598806.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2160707926.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The defender spent last season on loan with Bundesliga side Mainz and impressed during his year-long spell in Germany.\n\nMainz have been keen to make that deal permanent but claims they had a clause in the deal to sign Van den Berg outright for as little as \u00a35m are wide of the mark and the Reds have continued to field offers for the former PEC Zwolle teenager in recent weeks.\n\nLiverpool have been inundated with enquiries about the centre-half with Wolfsburg and Eredivisie champions PSV interested alongside newly-promoted Southampton and Mainz.\n\nThe ECHO understands PSV have become the latest club to have an offer turned down with reports on Monday suggesting the figure was around \u00a310m. The Reds are looking for \u00a320m for a player who signed a contract extension two years ago and are under no pressure to sell as a result.\n\nWith Southampton having already paid \u00a320m to sign Taylor Harwood-Bellis from Manchester City after his efforts in helping them gain promotion back to the Premier League and Bournemouth closing in on a \u00a315m capture of Dean Huijsen, who played just nine times in Serie A last season for Juventus, Liverpool feel their asking price for Van den Berg is not unfair.\n\nThat, though, is something that is disputed by Van den Berg himself with the Dutchman reiterating that belief in a chat after Friday's friendly win in Pennsylvania.\n\nVan den Berg said: \"I know in today's market [high prices] will happen. For the price they want for me, hmmm...Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325million, that is a lot more. Hopefully we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! But it is also a compliment.\n\n\"For me, it is about playing time. If I get it here, there is no better place to be. Of course, [the price tag] is a compliment. But it makes it difficult. \u00a320m is majorly high.\n\n\"Of course, I am here now. Liverpool is one of the biggest, if not the biggest club in the world. It has always been my dream. I am here to show myself I am Liverpool worthy. If he gives me a chance and likes me, there's a big chance of me staying. But we are still early in the window so we will see.\n\n\"I spoke with [Slot] on my first day. He said to me, I have to show myself in pre-season. I had my own visions, I want to play. We will see what happens. But I am happy here. My goal is to play football next year so we will see if it is here or somewhere else.\"\n\nThose comments echo what he told media in his homeland in June, when he was quoted by De Telegraaf as saying: \"You (Liverpool) didn't exude confidence in me all this time, but you do want to hinder my future. I want to keep playing every week and develop myself further. In Germany, I enjoy Dortmund away with 70,000 people, Bayern Munich away against Harry Kane, Stuttgart, Leipzig, Leverkusen, against clubs like that I am challenged every week.\"\n\nVan den Berg returned to Liverpool earlier this month determined to make an impression under new head coach Arne Slot and the 22-year-old started the 1-0 win over Real Betis on Friday night in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe is expected to feature when the Reds play Arsenal in their second friendly in the United States on Wednesday evening at Lincoln Financial Field.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType":

The centre-back is viewed around the \u00a320m mark by the decision-makers at Anfield, with the Dutchman the subject of interest from a host of clubs around Europe including Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven, Wolfsburg and Mainz, who he spent last season on loan with in Bundesliga.\n\nNewly-promoted Southampton are also credited with an interest and with the Saints having already paid \u00a320m to sign Taylor Harwood-Bellis from Manchester City after his efforts in helping them gain promotion back to the Premier League and Bournemouth closing in on a \u00a315m capture of Dean Huijsen, who played just nine times in Serie A last season for Juventus, Liverpool feel their asking price for Van den Berg is not unfair.\n\nThe former PEC Zwolle teenager is being given a chance by his Dutch compatriot Arne Slot this summer but the Reds are refusing to budge should the player himself feel his long-term future is best served away from Anfield.\n\nVan den Berg has made just four senior appearances since signing in the summer of 2019, with two of those coming in exceptional circumstances against Aston Villa and Shrewsbury in the Carabao and FA Cup in 2019 and 2020, respectively, when youth teams were fielded.\n\nAnd in a chat after Friday's 1-0 win over Real Betis at Pittsburgh's Acrisure Stadium, Van den Berg stated he feels such a figure could limit the level of interest in him this summer transfer window.\n\n\"I know in today's market [high prices] will happen,\" Van den Berg said. \"For the price they want for me, hmmm...Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325million, that is a lot more.

He said to me, I have to show myself in pre-season. I had my own visions, I want to play. We will see what happens. But I am happy here. My goal is to play football next year so we will see if it is here or somewhere else.\n\n\"For a centre back you need experience of being in the rhythm of playing every game. That's where I made the biggest steps. In terms of the training and environment here, you can't get any better.

Dominik Szoboszlai scored the only goal of the game for the Reds to give them their first victory of the summer after losing to Preston in a behind-closed-doors friendly last week.\n\nIt was an impressive performance the Reds, with Slot ringing the changes and giving minutes to 23 players. Among those that shone in Pittsburgh were forgotten duo Sepp van den Berg and Stefan Bajcetic.\n\nVan den Berg, who spent last season on loan at Mainz, has been back with the Reds in pre-season and was handed a chance to excel under Slot. And it's safe to say the Dutchman took that opportunity with both hands. He looked comfortable on the ball and composed in possession.\n\nIn fact, he completed the most passes (80) on the pitch against Betis. Van den Berg also won all his duels (1/1) and tackles (1/1) while making two interceptions and five recoveries - the third most for the Reds.\n\nFans were impressed with Van den Berg. One said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"I think Sepp van den Berg has been absolutely class. He has immense presence at the back. Not in a Virgil 'aura' type way but he has a lot of energy and electricity about his play. Looks assured and confident after his loan at Mainz.\"\n\nA second wrote: \"Anyone else really impressed with Sepp van den Berg that half? Seems to have matured bucketloads since he was last with us.\" A third said: \"Honestly, if we can convince him to stay, we don't need another centre-back if we keep Van den Berg. He deserves a chance and was faultless there. He's got the talent and I want to see it.\" A fourth added: \"We should keep him and see how he fits in this season. It doesn't hurt, but I get that he wants more game time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bajcetic, who endured a horror campaign with injuries, looked back to his destructive best against Betis. Despite only playing 26 minutes, the midfielder won the most duels (five). He also won 2/2 tackles and looked impressive in possession, completing 13/15 passes.\n\nSpeaking on Bajcetic's performance, Slot said: \"We need to remember that Stefan hasn't played for a year. In fact almost a year and a half. If a young player experiences that, then we need to give him time.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_king@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Kieran King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Bajcetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Bajcetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article29625140.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arne-Slot-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

For the price they want for me, Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320m-\u00a325m, that is a lot more, hopefully we can find a way.\n\n\"Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! But it is also a compliment. For me, it is about playing time. If I get it here, there is no better place to be. Of course, [the price tag] is a compliment. But it makes it difficult. \u00a320m is majorly high.\"\n\nGiven how young Van den Berg is and how impressive the defender has been in the last 12 months whilst out on loan, \u00a320m seems like a more than fair price tag for the Dutch youth international.\n\nIndeed, if Liverpool fail to sign a new defender before the start of the season, there's a real chance that Van den Berg could become a part of Arne Slot's first-team plans for the first half of the Premier League campaign.\n\nAs such, \u00a320m is a reasonable asking price for Van den Berg, who could develop into a top defender depending on if the youngster can earn a move away of break into Liverpool's senior team for good.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_walsh@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Dylan Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Gravenberch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Gravenberch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/07/GettyImages-2163857694-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

For the price they want for me, hmmm...\n\n\"Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325m that is a lot more. Hopefully we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! It is also a compliment. But it makes it difficult, \u00a320m is majorly high.\"\n\nVan den Berg has been loaned out for the last four seasons - at Preston, Schalke and Mainz, though he has been involved in Liverpool's pre-season camp and still wants to fight for his place under new boss Arne Slot.\n\nThe defender claimed he has had conversations with Slot, who told him to \"show himself\" and prove his quality, adding: \"My goal is to play football next year so we will see if it is here or somewhere else.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Van den Berg's future has been discussed - with Mainz's sporting director claiming the player \"definitely\" wanted to join the club on a permanent deal in June.\n\n\"The only one who has made a decision is Sepp,\" Heidel told German sports magazine Kicker. \"He definitely wants to stay in Mainz. He has said that very clearly in public.\"\n\nEarlier this summer the player appeared to be frustrated with the uncertainty over his future, claiming he \"wasn't looked after anymore\" and the club \"didn't exude confidence in me all this time\".\n\nBut this week he attempted to set the record straight earlier this summer, telling Sky Sports he was optimistic of a fresh start under Arne Slot and said he was happy to stay providing his game time improved.\n\n\"I'm still a Liverpool player. I enjoy it here, really. It's been a very nice pre-season. Of course a new coach, so a new era starts, fresh training, a new style of play, I really like it.\n\n\"For me the most important things is playing and if I can do it here then there's no better place. It's one of the biggest if not the biggest club in the world so if it's here then it's my dream. But for me the most important thing is playing.

\u00a38.4m bid for the defender waved off by the Reds.\n\nyou have updates\n\nLiverpool have reportedly rejected an initial offer for Sepp van den Berg from PSV Eindhoven.\n\nThe 22-year-old made the permanent switch to the red side of Merseyside from Eredivisie outfit PEC Zwolle ahead of the 2019-20 campaign under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nVan den Berg failed to cement a spot in the first-team thinking at Anfield, falling firmly behind the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip in the pecking order.\n\nThe centre-back has enjoyed a number of loan spells in recent times as he seeks regular senior action, spending over a year back Preston North End in the Championship.\n\nDuring a temporary spell at Mainz 05 during the 2023-24 term, Van den Berg played 35 times in the Bundesliga, scoring on three occasions for the German club.\n\nLiverpool reject PSV offer for Van den Berg?\n\nWith his Liverpool career all-but over, Van den Berg could be handed a way out of Anfield on a permanent deal during this summer's transfer window.\n\nIt is believed that Eredivisie giants PSV are keen on the 22-year-old, who is not part of Arne Slot's plans ahead of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nAccording to transfer specialist Fabrizio Romano, the Dutch side have submitted a formal offer worth around \u20ac10m (\u00a38.4m) for the defender.\n\nHowever, the report states that Liverpool quickly rejected this advance, with PSV failing to reach Liverpool's asking price for the player.\n\nIt was claimed earlier this month that the Reds are looking to stand firm at their \u00a316.9m price tag Van den Berg this summer as interest for his services increases.\n\nWhat is Liverpool's centre-back situation?\n\nHeading into the closing days of July, Liverpool are yet to make a signing in the summer window as Slot aims to imprint his style on a talented group of players.\n\nLast summer's business was all about midfield, with the likes of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho departing to the Saudi Pro League and taking plenty of top-flight knowhow with them.\n\nRyan Gravenberch, Wataru Endo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister all arrived at Anfield to strengthen Klopp's engine room options.\n\nVan Dijk is the clear first choice at centre-back, with youngster Jarell Quansah and France's Ibrahima Konate set to battle it out for the second spot.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source":

Of course, it is a compliment in one way. It's a sign of how well I did last year. But it makes it a bit more difficult the other way. If they only thought I was worth \u00a32m that wouldn't be nice! But \u00a320m is maybe on the high side.\"\n\nVan den Berg's excellent campaign on loan at Bundesliga outfit Mainz in 2023-24 has led to plenty of interest in him since he reported back for training earlier this month.\n\nMainz and fellow German outfit Wolfsburg both had permanent offers turned down, while PSV Eindhoven were also unable to put together a suitable financial package.\n\nSo where does that leave him at the start of a new era under Arne Slot? And is Liverpool's valuation justified?\n\nFor a start, it is important to stress that the young Dutch defender is not desperate to get away. The 22-year-old just wants to avoid a scenario where he stays put and finds himself a long way down the pecking order and starved of game time this season.\n\n\"Maybe I stay, maybe I go,\" he adds. \"I am here now. Liverpool is one of the biggest clubs in the world. It has always been my dream to play here and it still is my dream.\n\n\"I spoke with Arne on the first day and he said I have to show myself in pre-season. Of course I have my own visions about things. I like to play.\n\n\"I am here to show the new manager that I am Liverpool-worthy. If he gives me a chance and likes me, there's a big chance of me staying. But we are still early in the window so we will see what happens.\"\n\nIn the ongoing absence of senior centre-backs Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez, Van den Berg has used the opening weeks of pre-season wisely -- knuckling down and grasping the opportunity to impress Slot.\n\nHe showcased his athleticism in the fitness testing as he led the way before Mohamed Salah returned and knocked him off the top of the charts. Slot and his staff have been taken by his maturity and technical ability in training.\n\nThe benefits of that spell in Germany were clear for all to see in Friday's 1-0 win over Real Betis in Pittsburgh when he shone alongside Jarell Quansah during the opening hour.\n\n\"For a centre-back, you need the experience of being in the rhythm of playing every game,\" he says. \"That's where I made the biggest steps. In terms of the training and environment here, you can't get any better than Liverpool. But when I was away at Mainz, I played every game, stayed fit and made big steps. I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nLiverpool are in no rush to make a decision over Van den Berg's future. The plan was always to give him time to work under Slot in pre-season and so far he has exceeded their expectations.\n\nWhat is clear is that if he does move on, there will not be a cut-price deal on offer.\n\nSenior Anfield figures are adamant the \u00a320m price tag accurately reflects the fact he is only 22 and was widely regarded as one of the best young centre-backs in the Bundesliga last season. The reports from Mainz were glowing.\n\nContext is also provided by some of the deals which have been done elsewhere so far this summer.\n\nBournemouth agreed to pay Juventus up to \u00a315.2m for 19-year-old centre-back Dean Huijsen, who played just once for the Serie A outfit before making 13 appearances on loan at Roma in the second half of last season.\n\nSouthampton paid Manchester City \u00a320m to make Taylor Harwood-Bellis' move to the south coast permanent after he helped them win promotion back to the top flight while on loan.\n\nVan den Berg is more experienced than both of them, having clocked up a total of 136 appearances in senior club football so far in his career.\n\nHe was just 17 when he signed for Liverpool from Dutch outfit PEC Zwolle for \u00a34.4m in the summer of 2019. He made four senior appearances in 2019-20 but his development since then has continued away from Anfield with loan spells at Preston North End, Schalke and Mainz.\n\n\"I was a boy when I first came here,\" he adds.\n\n\"I had so little experience having only played in Holland a little bit. Now I have done one-and-a-half years in the Championship and another two years in the Bundesliga.\n\n\"I am still young but I feel very old!

The Saints recently splashed \u00a320 million to secure the signature of Taylor Harwood-Bellis from Manchester City, who played a pivotal role in their promotion to the Premier League.\n\nMeanwhile, Bournemouth is nearing a \u00a315 million deal for Dean Huijsen, who had a fringe role in Serie A with Juventus.

Van den Berg's strongest suitors - with Eindhovens Dagblad reporting that this was worth upwards of \u20ac10 million (\u00a38.4m).\n\nAlong with an up-front fee of \u20ac10 million, it is explained the PSV offered \"slightly higher\" than \u20ac2 million (\u00a31.7m) in further add-ons.\n\nHowever, the Reds are said to be \"holding firm\" on their valuation, which is claimed in the Netherlands to be \u20ac20 million (\u00a316.9m) rather than \u00a320 million.\n\nJournalist Rik Elfrink argues that it \"does not seem inconceivable\" that PSV will increase the package to around \u20ac15 million (\u00a312.6m), though it seems unlikely still that this would be accepted.\n\nSlot is yet to even make a final decision on whether Van den Berg will stay or go, with the Dutchman one of his first-choice centre-backs so far in pre-season.\n\nThat comes in the absence of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez, with Van den Berg expected to keep his place next to Jarell Quansah in the friendly against Arsenal on Wednesday night.\n\nPSV \"want to make quick progress\" as they seek a new addition at centre-back, and \"it is unclear whether the club is prepared to wait very long for Van den Berg.\"\n\nBut any move for the young defender is unlikely to be permitted until late in the summer, with Slot's internationals not set to rejoin the squad until next week.\n\nThe transfer window is open until September 2 in the Netherlands - two days later than the Premier League - but PSV's season kicks off with the Johan Cruijff Shield against Feyenoord on August 4.\n\nTheir Eredivisie campaign then begins on August 10 against RKC Waalwijk, by which point Liverpool will not even have concluded their pre-season.", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_lusby@thisisanfield.com", "name": "Jack Lusby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKC_Waalwijk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RKC Waalwijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johan Cruyff Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-07-26-239-Liverpool_Real_Betis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-02", "textStart": 2040, "textEnd": 2051}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2192, "textEnd": 2200}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 2244, "textEnd": 2253}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Reds are open to selling the Dutchman - but only for the right price.\n\nPSV Eindhoven are one of the clubs hoping to sign Van den Berg but almost certainly can't afford the \u00a320m asking price. That's a bit of a problem for the young defender, who is in favour of leaving this summer if he can't et regular game time with Liverpool.\n\nEx-Liverpool captain impressed with obvious Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement amid Real Madrid 'agreement'4 hours agoby Tashan Deniran-Alleyne\n\nJohn Barnes makes Mohamed Salah PREDICTION after experimental Liverpool role against Real Betis5 hours agoby Tashan Deniran-Alleyne\n\nLiverpool transfer news today: 'RIDICULOUS' Olmo offer, Kubo deal TRUTH, Gordon DECISION made6 hours agoby Tashan Deniran-Alleyne\n\n\"I know in today's market [high prices] will happen,\" said Van den Berg, per the Liverpool Echo. \"For the price they want for me, hmmm...Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325million, that is a lot more.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can find a way.

Of course, [the price tag] is a compliment. But it makes it difficult. \u00a320m is majorly high.\"\n\nPlayers very rarely talk about their price tags, especially when it's just an asking price. Van den Berg has been consistently open about a transfer this summer, however, and shows no restraint when it comes to discussing it.\n\nAs for the price, though, we see both sides. Van den Berg will look at the club hoping to sign him and know they can't pay \u00a320m. At the same time, Liverpool would expect to pay that for a player of his age and quality if they wanted to sign him this summer.\n\nAnd that's Van den Berg's problem. The simplest fix here is for him to break into Liverpool's squad and play regularly. If that doesn't happen, then someone is going to have to compromise.\n\nEither that's Liverpool on their price tag or Van den Berg on his hopes for the next season.

The Liverpool was forced to attempt a new tactic against Betis with no strikers at his disposal at this stage.\n\n\"During the season you will see us play with a real striker, but at this moment we have no one available,\" Slot explained following the win. Of course, Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo still need to return after their internatinal exploits this summer but that has not stopped a number of forwards being linked to transfers to Anfield.\n\nSlot himself has said 'it would be a surprise for all of us' if the Merseyside club do not make a signing this summer. With that said, Mirror Football takes a look at some of the bigger transfer stories currently surrounding the club.\n\nLiverpool defender reconsiders future\n\nSepp van den Berg has admitted he could yet stay at Liverpool after admitting last month that he wanted to leave Anfield. The 22-year-old defender has spent time on loan at Preston North End, Schalke and Mainz since joining the Reds in 2019 but has enjoyed his time working under Slot in pre-season thus far.\n\nVan den Berg has stiff competition up against the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah for a place in the team, but is content with his playing time in Liverpool's friendlies. He told Sky Sports: \"I'm still a Liverpool player. I enjoy it here, really,\"\n\n\"It's been a very nice pre-season. Of course, new coach, like new era starts, fresh training, new style of play. I really like it.\n\n\"For me, it's just about game time and, at the moment, I'm getting it here, so I'm happy at the moment. But like I said, it's still early. You never know what can happen, but for me the most important thing is playing.\n\n\"If I can do it here, there's no better place. It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest, clubs in the world, so if it's here, it's my dream. But for me, the most important thing is playing, so I will see what happens.\"\n\nLiverpool challenge Arsenal\n\nLiverpool are set to provide Arsenal competition in the race to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer according to reports. The Sporting CP forward, who arrived in Portugal from Coventry 12 months ago, scored 43 goals in 49 games last term and is said to have a \u00a386million release clause in his contract.\n\nThe Reds and Tottenham have both registered their interest in the Swedish sharpshooter, with Arsenal said to be unwilling to meet the fee. It is unlikely Liverpool would want to hit the figure either however.\n\nSporting director flies out\n\nGalatasaray's president, Dursun Ozbek, and sporting director Cenk Ergun are jetting out to meet with Liverpool over a deal for Ryan Gravenberch. Turkish outlet Yeni Safak report that Okan Buruk's side are keen to come to an agreement over the midfielder.\n\nThe 22-year-old arrived at Anfield from Bayern Munich for \u00a334.2m on transfer deadline day and made 38 appearances in his debut season. The Cimbom Aslan are hopeful of securing a loan deal for the former Ajax sarlet however.\n\nThe report claims that Slot would be willing sanction a temporary exit.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The England international's actions may leave some sweating after he signed a Real Madrid shirt in the United States.\n\nSlot will be hopeful of retraining the defender's services in his debut term in the Premier League, and has admitted he would be surprised if Liverpool do not add to the ranks. Little over four weeks remain for Liverpool to deliver.\n\nWith that said Mirror Football takes a look at some of the latest Liverpool transfer news and rumours.\n\nAnthony Gordon plan\n\nLiverpool are said to have not given up hope on landing Anthony Gordon, despite Newcastle's reluctance to sell the winger.\n\nEddie Howe has described Gordon as 'integral' to his vision, but it was not long ago a move was pitched for the 23-year-old as the Magpies looked to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. Gordon is even said to have discussed the move with England teammates.\n\nReports now suggest that Liverpool are considering putting together an offer that will include players in a bid to tempt Newcastle to let go of one of their star players. With the clubs already apart on valuation, it is not a deal that will come easy.\n\nReds eye forward\n\nHoffenheim striker Maximilian Beier is the latest forward to be linked to Liverpool this summer. Tutto Juve suggest the Reds are among a clutch of teams that include Manchester United, Juventus and Atletico Madrid who are to battle for the German's signature.\n\nThe 21-year-old scored 16 goals in 33 appearances in last season's Bundesliga, his first season in the division. The striker is reportedly valued at \u00a325million by Juventus but Hoffenheim want closer to \u00a334m.\n\nSepp van den Berg's transfer fee\n\nMore comments from Liverpool's young Dutch defender have emerged. Sepp van den Berg has spent his last three seasons on loan away from the club and admitted he was currently enjoying pre-season under new boss Slot.\n\nIt appears, despite the 22-year-old being open to a future at Anfield, he has been left frustrated by the club's valuation of him. Van den Berg believes the figures touted are too high for his services.\n\n\"I know in today's market [high prices] will happen,\" Van den Berg said. \"For the price they want for me, hmmm...Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325million, that is a lot more.\n\n\"Hopefully we can find a way.

The Reds have until September 2 to complete their business but are yet to make any new additions to Arne Slot's squad.\n\nSlot and Co. are currently in the United States taking part in the club's pre-season tour across the Atlantic. While the Reds are busy preparing for the new Premier League campaign, work will also be underway behind the scenes on strengthening the squad through the transfer market.\n\nDespite not yet making a new signing this summer, Liverpool have been credited with an interest in several potential new additions to their squad. There have also been rumours of players who could leave Anfield this summer, with the club yet to sanction any major exits.\n\nThe ECHO has put together some of the latest Liverpool transfer news and gossip that has been doing the rounds over the last 24 hours.\n\nLiverpool have been handed an update on the future of Juventus forward Federico Chiesa. The Reds have been heavily linked with a move for the Italy international this summer.\n\nChiesa's contract with Juventus is set to expire in 2025 and there are no signs of an extension being agreed. As a result, reports have speculated that Juventus would be willing to allow Chiesa to leave the club this summer.\n\nAccording to TuttoMercatoWeb, Chiesa has received offers from Saudi Pro League club Al Ahli and Turkish team Besiktas. However, it has been stated that Chiesa has rejected both teams due to his preference to join a club with Champions League football next season.\n\nElsewhere, Liverpool may have to wait to receive another offer for Sepp van den Berg. The Reds rejected a bid from PSV Eindhoven with reports suggesting the offer was in the region of \u00a310 million.\n\nAccording to journalist Rik Elfrink, the Eredivisie club will not make a second offer for Van den Berg until next week. It's understood that Liverpool are seeking closer to \u00a320 million for the centre-back who spent last season on loan at Mainz.\n\nIt remains to be seen if and when PSV will make a fresh offer for Van den Berg, and what the fee will be should one arrive.

Liverpool have valued him at around \u00a320-\u00a325m after his impressive performances.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old believes the valuation is a bit too steep. \"I know in today's market (high prices) will happen, he told the Daily Mail. \"For the price they want for me, hmmm...\n\n\"Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325m that is a lot more. Hopefully we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! It is also a compliment. But it makes it difficult, \u00a320m is majorly high.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Van den Berg will be loaned out for a fifth season after stints at Preston North End, Schalke and Mainz.\n\nLiverpool plotting offer for defender\n\nTEAMtalk state the Reds are ready to firm up their interest in Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. Liverpool have been long linked with the Brazilian and strengthening defence is understood to be one of the priorities this summer following the exit of Joel Matip.\n\nSince Matip's departure, there is not a fixed centre-back partner for Virgil van Dijk and Breimer is thought to be a strong option. The report adds that Bremer has reached the top of Liverpool's wish list and they are ready to test Juventus with a 'big offer.'\n\nBremer is not set to come at a cheap price, having become one of the most consistent defenders in Serie A, where he has often been included in the league's team of the year.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruna_reis@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Bruna Reis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preston North End F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00ebl_Matip", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u00ebl Matip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Schalke_04", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Schalke 04"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29630629.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2161859993.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The Reds played Real Betis at the Acrisure Stadium in the American city and came out 1-0 winners in a largely unforgettable game. But there was something about the event which was noteworthy.\n\nLiverpool got themselves amongst some esteemed company. Taylor Swift, U2 and Luke Combs to be exact. How? They're the only other people to have used the home dressing room at the stadium other than the Pittsburgh Steelers, the iconic NFL franchise.\n\nThe college team which also uses the impressive stadium by the river in the city have their own state-of-the-art changing facility in the expansive space down in the bowels of the arena. So it's rare for other teams to step foot in where the Steelers prepare for their NFL games.\n\nThe others have played big concerts at the stadium but Liverpool are the first other sports team to use the dressing room.\n\nIt's certainly rare for a player to speak freely about the fee they are worth but Liverpool defender Sepp van den Berg was not shy in discussing it as he waltzed through the mixed zome at the Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Dutch centre-back stopped to do interviews with media and was quite clearly not overly impressed yet still flattered that the Reds want around \u00a320m to sell him this summer.\n\nHe said: \"I know in today's market it will happen. For the price they want for me, hmmm... Liverpool may think it is right as I had a good season, if they want \u00a320-\u00a325m is a lot more. \"Hopefully we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! But it is also a compliment.\"\n\nVan den Berg clearly wants to get off and play regularly elsewhere after playing 140 games at Liverpool, in the Championship, in the Bundesliga and his homeland. Liverpool will cite the fact Southampton have paid \u00a320m for Manchester City 's Harwood-Bellis, who is the same age.\n\nBournemouth have also agreed an initiial \u00a312.6m deal with Juventus for the defender Dean Huijsen. Who, at 19, could end up costing around \u00a315m with add-ons.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is not on tour with Liverpool in America but he is travelling the States with pal and Real Madrid ace Jude Bellingham.\n\nThe pair have had a bromance for some time now and Liverpool fans once hoped their right-back would be able to help lure Bellingham to Anfield so they could hang out all the time on Merseyside.\n\nBut now they're fearing it could work the other way and that Bellingham might tell his pal to come join him in sunny Spain with his contract due to expire next summer.\n\nThere were pictures of the pair enjoying themselves on a rollercoaster in the US which everyone enjoyed. But Liverpool fans' anxiety over the future of the right-back certainly won't be helped by the snaps of him signing a Real Madrid shirt for a young fan.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The ECHO understands the Dutchman's priority has been to get a clear image of his squad in pre-season, discover which positions need strengthening and then make his moves in August.\n\nSuch a strategy does little to excite supporters in pre-season but what we can expect is for Richard Hughes and co. to implement Slot's plans as soon as they receive word of what he wants. While it is still believed to be quiet at Liverpool this week, there are five deals which could in theory be completed very quickly if the right circumstances allow.\n\nBoth incomings and outgoings could be on the cards as July draws to a close. So take a look at five transfers the ECHO believes could be completed before the week ends.\n\nSepp van den Berg\n\nPerhaps the most likely deal to be done is for Van den Berg to depart Merseyside permanently. The Reds quickly rejected a bid of reportedly \u00a310m from PSV Eindhoven for the centre-back and Slot is not in a desperate need to lower the club's asking price of \u00a320m.\n\nSouthampton, Mainz and Wolfsburg are all thought to be keen on the Dutchman. Now PSV have made the first offer for Van den Berg, it is not out of the question that other bids start trickling in over the course of the week with one reaching the asking price.\n\nGleison Bremer\n\nLiverpool look like they will need to wait on Juventus before being able to pull the trigger on their Gleison Bremer approach. The Turin club are locked in negotiations for Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo but once he is through the door, there is a good chance that Bremer will be allowed to leave.\n\nBremer has an asking price of \u00a350m on his head so the Reds may need to rely on the \u00a320m accrued from Van den Berg's sale to get the deal over the line. Should he join, it would be a big boost to a defence that needs strengthening.\n\nBen Doak\n\nPremier League clubs are circling around the young forward ahead of the forthcoming season with Southampton and Leicester City both holding an interest in a loan move. The ECHO understands Doak will sit down with the powers that be after the pre-season tour to discuss his short-term future.\n\nHowever, this is not to say that if a lucrative loan move is offered a deal could not be done sooner. A spell out on loan for the 18-year-old could help forge his development and create a natural replacement for Mo Salah when the time comes.\n\nWataru Endo\n\nOur last two entries fall under the unlikely column to be completed this week but things can move quickly in football. Liverpool received a bid from Marseille for Endo on Sunday which was rejected and it is believed there is little appetite to sell the central midfielder at this stage.\n\nHowever, each player has a price and the Japanese is no different. Endo featured in the friendly against Real Betis and there are a number of clubs circulating around the 31-year-old, so do not be surprised if a better bid is received this week.\n\nAnthony Gordon\n\nReports this weekend suggested Liverpool have been encouraged to step up their interest in Gordon again this summer. Newcastle dramatically offered the winger to the Reds in return for Jarell Quansah earlier in the window but that offer was rejected.\n\nThis is not thought to have ended the interest though and boyhood Liverpool fan Gordon could still be keen on moving to Anfield if the right offer arises. The Magpies have been fairly quiet in the transfer window too so could be waiting for Gordon to depart to get their business done - there is definitely space for a deal to be completed.\n\nJoin our

As a result, Iversen is on the lookout for a new club. As for van den Berg, the last two seasons have seen him loaned to Schalke and Mainz.\n\nThe Dutchman is now in pre-season training with Liverpool, ahead of Arne Slot's first season as manager at Anfield. But, there has been talk of a permanent exit this summer and recent reports state that PSV have seen a \u20ac10million bid rejected.

Hopefully, we can find a way. Maybe I stay, maybe I go. The first reaction from me is that it was quite high! It is also a compliment. But it makes it difficult - \u00a320m is majorly high.\"\n\nVan den Berg added: \"I spoke with (Slot) on my first day. He said to me I have to show myself in pre-season. We will see what happens. I am happy here. My goal is to play football next year, so we will see if it is here or somewhere else. It has always been my dream. I am here to show myself I am Liverpool worthy.\n\n\"If he gives me a chance and likes me, there's a big chance of me staying. But we are still early in the window, we will see. I was a boy when I came here, 17. I have done one and a half years in the Championship, two years in the Bundesliga. I am still young but I feel very old! It's about game time and experience. If I get it here, there is no better place to be.\"\n\nIversen, meanwhile, has one year left to run on his Foxes contract. With Mads Hermansen, Jakub Stolarczyk and Danny Ward for competition, game time at Leicester looks unlikely for the 27-year-old next season.\n\nNewly promoted Derby County were linked with the Dane, along with relegated Sheffield United. However, the Premier League side's asking price of \u00a31.5million - and the player's wages - are said to have put both sides off pursuing a move.", "source": {"uri": "lep.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lancashire Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_hodgson@lep.co.uk", "name": "George Hodgson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_van_den_Berg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sepp van den Berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffen_Iversen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steffen Iversen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Johansson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Iversen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Iversen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preston North End F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Schalke_04", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Schalke 04"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ward_(Welsh_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ward (Welsh footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_County_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derby County F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.lep.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2024/04/24/14/50/CS092_West_Brom_v_Preston.jpg.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769194", "eventUri": "eng-9769194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

English clubs interested in signing 'exceptional' Liverpool player who Arne Slot wants gone", "body": "A number of English teams are believed to be interested in signing a Liverpool player this summer who Arne Slot wants to sell.\n\nThe Dutch coach has been tasked with an almost impossible job this off-season in getting Liverpool prepared for the new Premier League season, the first time the Reds are experiencing this without Jurgen Klopp at the helm.\n\nWith Arne Slot and his team currently in America, transfer business has been slow, with Wataru Endo and Sepp van den Berg have been subject to transfer offers, both if which have been swiftly rejected by Liverpool.\n\nAnd one player is now attracting interest from English clubs this summer.\n\nAccording to the Athletic, Rhys Williams is on the radar for a number of League One clubs this summer, with the Kirkby academy graduate expected to leave Liverpool having already been deemed by Slot as not part of the first-team plans.\n\nLauded as 'exceptional' by Klopp, the 23-year-old centre-back has not featured for Liverpool since the 2020/21 season, with Williams since going out on various loan moves to the likes of Swansea City, Blackpool and Port Vale.\n\nWith the defender now training with the U-21s, it's clear that Williams needs to move on from Liverpool if he's to get his once-promising career back up and running having not played for the Reds in three years.\n\nAnd with League One teams interested in signing the youngster, Williams should be pushing for a move out of Anfield, with the defender aware that he needs to start playing regular football if he's to reach his true potential.\n\nWilliams' career has gone in a direction nobody would have predicted after the defender broke through into Liverpool's starting XI during the 2020/21 season, with the centre-back showing promise of becoming a regular at Anfield.\n\nHowever, football is a funny and cruel game, and Williams is now in need of a fresh start away from Anfield, with Liverpool in a position where they must find a solution for the defender as soon as possible.\n\nSpending the summer training with Liverpool's U-21s has done little to help Williams, and the sooner the Reds find a suitor for the youngster, the quicker the defender can start working on his career and getting back up to scratch.", "source": {"uri":

A bid, worth nearly \u00a312m was made by Marseille, with new manager Roberto De Zerbi keen to add the 31-year-old to his squad.\n\nLiverpool are expected to add more midfielders to their ranks but the new manager does have Stefan Bajcetic back in contention, after he missed most of last season through injury.\n\nThe youngster, who had an outstanding breakthrough season, was restricted to just three appearances last season but he believes that the experience has made him stronger.\n\nLooking back on last year with the club's official website he said: \"[It was probably] the hardest year I've had so far, mentally and physically. But I got through it and it only made me stronger, both mentally and physically as well.

The ECHO has been there every step of the way.\n\nHogan: Thoughts with victims of Southport attacks\n\nLiverpool CEO Billy Hogan says his and the whole club's thoughts are with the victims of Monday's horrendous attacks inside a summer dance camp in Southport that claimed the lives of two children and left nine more injured, including six critically.\n\nA 17-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder with Merseyside Police still attempting to uncover a motive behind the stabbings. Liverpool put out a collaborative tweet with Everton on Monday evening in support of those impacted by the tragic events on Hart Street, saying: \"Liverpool and Everton football clubs come together to send our love and support to all those affected by today's tragic events in Southport.\"\n\nThe ECHO was at a summer football camp at Philadelphia Union's Subaru Park stadium on Monday, which was attended by dozens of local children and Reds chief Hogan was scheduled to be one of the Liverpool figures lined up to speak to the media on the day.\n\nA wide-ranging chat about the club's pre-season tour of the United States had been planned but Hogan was keen to acknowledge the shocking incident before the conversation with a handful of publications got underway in Philadelphia.\n\nMr Hogan said: \"Before we start I just wanted to say that given the events that have taken place in Southport, the terrible events that have taken place there, our thoughts are with the victims of the families, so I didn't want to start without acknowledging that.\"\n\nLiverpool are expected to offer their full support in the coming days and weeks in any way they can to the families who have been affected by the senseless and incomprehensible attacks.\n\nUnhappy Arsenal\n\nLiverpool's summer soccer camp, which was overseen by the legendary Sami Hyypia on the day, was taking place just a goalkeeper's punt away from where Mikel Arteta was putting his Arsenal players through their paces at Subaru Park.\n\nWhispers across the 4G pitches where Liverpool's event was being held in tandem with Philadelphia Union was that Arsenal were unhappy that the Reds were undertaking the event at the same time they were preparing for Wednesday's friendly at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nIt was openly discussed about how the Londoners were not best pleased at how Liverpool had been allowed to host the festivities at that particular date and time and it was also claimed that the Gunners were unhappy that their opponents in Wednesday's 'Rivals in Red' showdown had been given first refusal on the use of the stunning Lincoln Financial Field, which is the home of NFL franchise the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAs a result, Arsenal were given the facilities of MLS outfit Philadelphia Union to make use of, which was said to have not been received too warmly. Some added needle for Wednesday night, perhaps?\n\nSpeculation persists for several\n\nLiverpool are now set to be the only club to have not signed a player in the Premier League this summer with Arne Slot keen to get a look at his full complement of players before recruitment decisions are made with sporting director Richard Hughes.\n\nFulham's deal with Arsenal for Emile Smith-Rowe means the Reds are the only club not to have concluded any transfer business and those hoping for significant movement and developments were likely irked further when Wednesday's opponents were revealing the \u00a342m capture of Riccardo Calafiori from Bologna just a few hundred yards away from a Liverpool event at Philadelphia Union on Monday morning.\n\nArsenal themselves and staff at Subaru Park, where Arteta had his players going through a training session, were growing increasingly agitated by the assembled press waiting outside for the post-session press conference at the stadium.\n\nWith reporters keen to confirm that Calafiori was in fact training with his new team-mates before his formal confirmation, organisers and club staff repeatedly implored journalists to move away from the gate where some of the players were visible to interested onlookers.\n\nThose with Liverpool connections wasted little time cracking wise about just wanting to see what a new signing looks like but there are more than a handful within the Reds' ranks whose own futures are the subject of much speculation right now.\n\nWataru Endo is wanted by Marseille having had a bid close to \u00a312m rejected by Liverpool while Ben Doak is wanted by a number of Premier League clubs including the newly-promoted pair of Leicester City and Southampton. Sepp van den Berg is attracting the attention of several including Mainz, Wolfsburg and Southampton and the Reds turned down an offer from Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven, reported to be around \u00a310m.

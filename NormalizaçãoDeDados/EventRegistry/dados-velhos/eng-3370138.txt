I've been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let's finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend.'\n\nIt was followed by another, which added: 'Don't waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don't worry about the rest.'\n\nAlthough Soudant was awarded a payout earlier this year, she said she was still fighting to be recognized as creator of the lighting project, which was eventually handed over to one of her former employees because of the dispute.\n\nBusy star: Angelina is shown in March before a speech at the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland\n\nShe told The Guardian newspaper: 'I am an artist and this is my work. When someone tries to steal my work it is something else. This is all very painful for me.'\n\nSoudant insisted the money she received for damage to her reputation was 'nothing' compared with what she had experienced.\n\nShe added: 'Of course, people think Brad Pitt is right, that ''he's the good guy and she is wrong''.'\n\nBig family: Brad and Angelina are shown in June 2014 with children Zahara Marley Jolie-PItt and Maddox Jolie-Pitt at Los Angeles International Airport\n\nPitt's solicitors, Hogan Lovells, insisted the lighting design inspiration came from Brad himself.\n\nAn architect working on the property also told the court: 'The lighting ideas came principally from Mr Pitt himself. He is passionate about architecture and knew what he wanted to achieve.'\n\nA representative for Pitt also disputed Soudant's claim for credit.\n\nHappier times: Angelina and Bradd are shown in November 2015 in NYC\n\n'We respect the Court's decision resolving this long running, standard dispute over payment of invoices,' a spokesperson for Pitt told Vanity Fair via e-mail.\n\n'This narrow ruling does not address any copyright issues involving [lighting] designs developed by Brad and has no connection to Chateau Miraval,' the representative wrote.\n\nPitt and Jolie despite their split

She said the credit went to one of her employees instead.\n\n\"I am an artist and this is my work.

Pitt \"wanted to make it an exceptional place and believed that light should be at the heart of this,\" Soudant said.\n\nBut Soudant isn't satisfied with just the payment, which was ordered in April. She wants to receive credit for her design work, which Pitt has claimed for himself.\n\nShe claims the couple drove her company towards financial ruin by failing to honor bills and by ruining her reputation by failing to acknowledge her artistic contributions.\n\nThe setting for this home improvement imbroglio is the ch\u00e2teau in Provence, surrounded by vineyards and 1,000 acres of land. In 1979, Pink Floyd recorded their album the The Wall on the estate.\n\nPitt and Jolie first spotted the ch\u00e2teau by helicopter, then rented it until they persuaded the owner, an American, to sell it to them for around $52 million in 2008.\n\nAfter moving in with their six children, the couple set about transforming the property to their tastes and hired a chief designer to oversee what one French newspaper described as a \"pharaonic project\" including installing a gym, a spa, a huge wine cellar and a motorcycle track, the Guardian said.\n\nIn 2010, Pitt asked Soudant to do the lighting. She claimed she was given \"carte blanche\" to light four buildings on the estate. No contract was signed, but Soudant said she billed Pitt and Jolie's company, Chateau Miraval, every month for her fees, while her Lumi\u00e8res Studio carried out technical studies and the installations, all of which were tried out on scaled-down models at her Paris studio before being taking to the chateau.\n\nSoudant said she employed 17 people on what she called the \"BP project,\" including architects, designers, lighting and acoustic specialists and even an optical engineer to calculate the angle of the sun's rays on the chateau.\n\nTwo years and $29 million later, the project was still unfinished with various contractors and sub-contractors passing the blame, the Guardian said.\n\nThe Paris appeal court heard that Pitt had stopped paying Soudant and her company when his chief designer claimed she had billed for $5.7 million. Judges ruled that this figure had been greatly exaggerated and that delays were not Soudant's fault.\n\nSoudant told the court she had no idea why Pitt had stopped paying her. But he continued to send her emails, saying \"Odile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish.\"\n\nWhen she didn't receive payment, she said she couldn't in turn pay her employees and contractors and had to suspend operations.\n\nTen days later, she said Pitt sent an email saying: \"I don't know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don't attack friends. I've been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let's finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend.\"\n\nThat email was followed by another, in which Pitt said: \"Don't waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don't worry about the rest.\"\n\nWhile Soudant continues to demand credit for the project, Pitt's attorney, Hogan Lovells, insisted the lighting design inspiration came from the actor himself.\n\nAn architect working on the project backed up this assertion to the court, saying, \"The lighting ideas came principally from Mr Pitt himself. He is passionate about architecture and knew what he wanted to achieve.\"\n\nIn an email to Vanity Fair, a representative for Pitt also disputed Soudant's claim for credit and chalked up the dispute to a \"standard dispute over payment of invoices.\" The representative added there were copyright issues involved in the lighting designs developed by Pitt, which have no connection to Ch\u00e2teau Miraval.\n\nSoudant told The Guardian it's very distressing that Pitt is allegedly trying to steal credit for her work. \"I am an artist and this is my work. When someone tries to steal my work it is something else. This is all very painful for me.'\n\nShe insisted that the money she has so far received in damages is \"nothing\" compared to what Pitt is doing to her reputation. \"Of course, people think Brad Pitt is right, that \"he's the good guy and she is wrong.'\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing

If you'd like to learn more...\n\nChateau Miraval is where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie became husband and wife back in 2014, and now the sprawling estate in Provence has brought the divorced exes together one more time -- as plaintiffs in a lawsuit.\n\nAs The Guardian reports, the former couple are being sued by designer Odile Soudant, who was in charge of the lighting for the multimillion-dollar renovation of their chateau in the south of France, and now claims that Brangelina stiffed her on more than a half-million euros for work completed.\n\nHer suit claims that Pitt and Jolie \"drove her company towards financial ruin by failing to honour bills for a multimillion-euro project to illuminate the 17th-century property.\"\n\nDetails On Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie's Divorce Documents 02:04 Details On Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie's Divorce Documents 02:03 Brad And Angelina Custody Battle 00:45 Brad and Angelina wax figures separated at Madame Tussauds 00:37 Angelina Jolie files for divorce from Brad Pitt 01:53 Angelina Jolie Opens Up About Having Bell's Palsy 00:38 Angelina Jolie reveals Bell's palsy diagnosis\n\nStory continues below\n\nREAD MORE: Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt have not been dating other people since split\n\nIn April, the Paris court of appeal ordered the Chateau Miraval company -- owned jointly by Jolie ad Pitt -- to pay Soudant \u20ac565,000, including \u20ac60,000 for damaging her reputation (approximately CAD$839,000).\n\nAs Soudant told the Guardian, she had kept the court's legal decision confidential while hoping to resolve the matter amicably; that, apparently, didn't happen.\n\nIn 2010, Soudant says Pitt asked her to come up with ways to exploit the chateau's natural light. \"He wanted to make it an exceptional place and believed that light should be at the heart of this,\" Soudant told Lib\u00e9ration.\n\nAccording to Soudant, she was given \"carte blanche\" to light four buildings on the estate, including the 40-room main chateau. And although there was no contract, Soudant claims that she billed Pitt and Jolie's company each month, employing 17 people, including architects, designers, lighting and acoustic specialists, and even an optical engineer who calculated the angle of the sun's rays as they entered the windows.\n\nAfter two years and a reported \u20ac25 million (CAD$37 million), the project remained unfinished, with Soudant telling the court that Pitt stopped paying her company due to a billing dispute.\n\nREAD MORE: Brad Pitt opens up about divorce from Angelina Jolie\n\nWhen her continued requests for money in order to pay employees and contractors weren't answered, she says she had no choice but to suspend operations of her company. Ten days later, she alleges Pitt sent her an email reading: \"I don't know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don't attack friends. I've been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let's finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend.\"\n\nA second mail from Pitt read: \"Don't waste time with legal action.

When someone tries to steal my work it is something else,\" she said. \"This is all very painful for me.\"\n\nPitt, however, begs to differ, offering a statement to the Paris court in which an architect who worked on the project declared: \"The lighting ideas came principally from Mr Pitt himself. He is passionate about architecture and knew what he wanted to achieve.\"\n\nDespite their divorce, the former couple decided to maintain joint ownership of the chateau as an investment, as the property's vineyards produce approximately 150,000 bottles of wine per year.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100, "id": 500, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Electrical", "wgt": 100, "id": 1118, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Electrical"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Home_and_Garden", "wgt": 100, "id": 1119, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Home and Garden"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc", "id": "74"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113913"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303358", "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "309044", "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "314366", "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Tussauds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "354862", "label": {"eng": "Madame Tussauds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_sculpture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "362373", "label": {"eng": "Wax sculpture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brangelina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "513084", "label": {"eng": "Brangelina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "546117", "label": {"eng": "Bell's palsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_Miraval,_Correns-Var", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1329897", "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, Correns-Var"}}]}

The suit had remained out of the press for some time (it was first reported by Lib\u00e9ration on Wednesday), but in April, a Paris court of appeal ordered Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, a Jolie-Pitt company, to pay Soudant \u20ac565,000, of which \u20ac60,000 was demanded for damage to the designer's reputation.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Pitt hired Soudant in 2010 to flood his and Angelina's French abode with light and gave her \"carte blanche\" (though no contract was signed) to do so. Soudant sent Pitt monthly bills to cover her expenses and employed 17 people to make his blindingly bright dreams a reality.\n\n\u20ac25 million later, the project still wasn't finished. Meanwhile, Pitt had stopped paying Soudant but was still sending her emails asking her to, \"Come here please. I need you to finish,\" according to documents Soudant presented in court.

Picture: Carlo Allegri/ Reuters\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been ordered to pay their lighting designer 565 000 Euros (approximately R8.4 million) for reportedly failing to pay her bills and damaging her reputation.\n\nOdile Soudant took legal action against the former couple - who split up last September for allegedly failing to credit her work on their French home and driving her company towards financial ruin by failing to honour bills for a huge lighting project on the Chateau Miraval estate.\n\nIn April, the Paris court of appeal ordered Brad and Angelina's Chateau Miraval company to pay the sum to the designer, which included 60 000 Euros (approximately R964 000) for damaging her reputation, but the legal ruling was only reported in French news outlet Lib\u00e9ration on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to legal documents, the former couple - who have Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne together - undertook a huge renovation project on the property and in 2010, Brad, 53, asked Odile to come up with ways to exploit natural light in the house and its adjoining buildings.\n\nShe said: \"He wanted to make it an exceptional place and believed that light should be at the heart of this.\"\n\nNo contract was signed, but the designer billed the Hollywood stars' company for her fees every month while her Lumi\u00e8res Studio carried out technical studies and tried out her installations on scaled down models before she had them fitted in the property.\n\n17 people were employed for the venture - including architects, designers and an optical engineer - and it was unfinished two years later, with various contractors and sub-contractors blaming others for the delays.\n\nThe court heard the 'Moneyball' star stopped paying the company when his chief designer claimed she had billed for 4.9 million Euros, but the judges ruled the figure had been \"greatly exaggerated\" and the delays were not Odile's fault.\n\nIn evidence, the lighting expert said she had no idea why she had stopped being paid at the time but she had to suspend operations when her requests for money to pay her own staff went unanswered.\n\nShe claims she received an email 10 days later from Brad, which read: \"I don't know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don't attack friends. I've been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let's finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note.

It was here in 1979 that Pink Floyd recorded the celebrated album The Wall.\n\nPitt and Jolie first rented the ch\u00e2teau, then persuaded the then-American owner to sell it to them for \u20ac45m.\n\nAfter moving in with their six children, they set about transforming it to their tastes and appointed a chief designer to oversee what one French newspaper described as a \"pharaonic project\" including installing a gym, a spa, a huge wine cellar and a motorcycle track.\n\nIn 2010, Pitt, a fan of the French architect Jean Nouvel (one of his daughters is named Shiloh Nouvel) engaged Soudant to come up with ways to exploit natural light in the ch\u00e2teau and its adjoining buildings.\n\nSoudant had worked for Nouvel's architecture company in Paris where she had set up the 'Lumi\u00e8re' (light) department before creating her own company Lumi\u00e8res Studio in 2009. Soudant says she travelled to Miraval in 2010 to meet Pitt.\n\n\"He wanted to make it an exceptional place and believed that light should be at the heart of this,\" Soudant told Lib\u00e9ration.\n\nShe claims she was given \"carte blanche\" to light four buildings on the estate, including the 40-room ch\u00e2teau. No contract was signed, but Soudant says she billed Pitt and Jolie's company every month for her fees, while Lumi\u00e8res Studio carried out technical studies and the installations, all of which were tried out on scaled down models at her Paris studio before being installed.\n\nSoudant says she employed 17 people on what she called the \"BP project\", including architects, designers, lighting and acoustic specialists and even an optical engineer to calculate the angle of the sun's rays on the ch\u00e2teau.\n\nTwo years and a reported \u20ac25m later, the project was still unfinished with various contractors and sub-contractors passing the blame.\n\nThe French appeal court heard that Pitt had stopped paying Soudant and her company when his chief designer claimed she had billed for \u20ac4.9m. Judges ruled that this figure had been greatly exaggerated and that delays were not the lighting expert's fault.\n\nIn her evidence to the court, Soudant said at the time she had no idea why Pitt had stopped paying her and that he continued to send her emails saying: \"Odile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish.\"\n\nWhen her requests for money to pay her employees and contractors went unanswered, she said she was forced to close the company.\n\nTen days later, she says Pitt sent an email saying: \"I don't know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don't attack friends. I've been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let's finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend.\"\n\nA second mail read: \"Don't waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don't worry about the rest.\"\n\nShe was awarded her pay-out in April, but Soudant says she is still fighting to be legally recognised as the creator of the lighting project at Miraval, which she says was handed over to one of her former employees after her dispute with Pitt.\n\nHogan Lovells, the solicitors defending Pitt, told Lib\u00e9ration the inspiration for the lighting at Ch\u00e2teau Miraval came from Pitt.\n\nIn a statement to the Paris court, an architect working on the property stated: \"The lighting ideas came principally from Mr Pitt himself. He is passionate about architecture and knew what he wanted to achieve.\"\n\nNow divorced, Pitt and Jolie have decided to keep the ch\u00e2teau - where they produce wine and olive oil - as an investment.\n\nTheir first wine production of ros\u00e9 in 2012 sold out in five hours. Since then, they have produced red and white wines making around 150,000 bottles a year, which sell for around \u20ac15 a bottle.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted Soudant and Hogan Lovells for comment.",

Now, the local French interior designer is suing both actors for failing to credit her for work on their chateau in Provence.\n\nOdile Soudant is the French designer who was happy to make some design work for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in their Provence mansion. But divorce of the stars has ricochetted on many people, including Ms Soudant who claims Brangelina drove her company towards financial ruin by failing to honour bills for a multimillion-euro project to illuminate the 17th-century property.\n\nBrad and Angie tied together via their joint companies, one of them is Ch\u00e2teau Miraval - named after the vast estate. In April, the Paris court of appeal ordered this company to pay Odile Soudant \u20ac565,000, including \u20ac60,000 for damaging designer's reputation.\n\nSoudant said that she preferred to remain this case confidential until now and had believed she could resolve the issue with Brad Pitt amicably, Lib\u00e9ration reported.

She is now suing to be legally recognised as the creator of the project.\n\nAccording to the paper, Mr Pitt and Ms Jolie never paid up for a mammoth project to transform the Chateau Miraval, near Aix-en-Provence in southern France, where the superstars got married in 2014.\n\nThe A-listers, who divorced last year, had hired Ms Soudant and her 17 workers to carry out a \u20ac25m project to use natural light to brighten the 40-bedroom chateau, where Pink Floyd recorded an album in the late seventies.\n\nMs Soudant worked in a studio in Paris to design the adjustments to the chateau, only to partially complete the redesigns in full scale at the actual property.\n\nHowever, Ms Soudant said that Mr Pitt suddenly stopped paying the bills, even though he continued to ask her to keep working. She had not signed a contract prior to the work beginning.\n\n\"Odile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,\" Mr Pitt wrote in an email, according to court documents seen by the Liberation newspaper.\n\nMr Pitt continued to plead with the French designer when things turned sour over the lack of payment.\n\n\"I don't know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don't attack friends.

I've been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let's finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend.''\n\nIt was followed by another, which added: ''Don't waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don't worry about the rest.''\n\nAlthough Odile was awarded a payout earlier this year, she said she is still fighting to be recognised as creator of the lighting project, which was eventually handed over to one of her former employees because of the dispute.\n\nShe told the Guardian newspaper: ''I am an artist and this is my work. When someone tries to steal my work it is something else. This is all very painful for me.''\n\nShe insisted the money she received for damage to her reputation was ''nothing'' compared with what she had experienced.\n\nShe added: ''Of course, people think Brad Pitt is right, that 'he's the good guy and she is wrong'.''\n\nThe 'Tree of Life' star's solicitors, Hogan Lovells, insisted the lighting design inspiration came from Brad himself.\n\nAnd an architect working on the property told the court: ''The lighting ideas came principally from Mr Pitt himself. He is passionate about architecture and knew what he wanted to achieve.''", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100, "id": 500, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Electrical", "wgt": 100, "id": 1118, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Electrical"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Home_and_Garden", "wgt": 100, "id": 1119, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Home and Garden"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc", "id": "74"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113913"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303358", "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "309044", "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "314366", "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "339730", "label": {"eng": "Moneyball (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teau_Miraval,_Correns-Var", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1329897", "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, Correns-Var"}}]}

Angelina Jolie to pay 568,000 euros ($667,000) to a lighting designer they employed for their chateau in southern France, judicial sources said Friday.\n\nThe court ruled on April 19 in favour of Odile Soudant, whose company went bankrupt, in the dispute with Chateau Miraval, the firm that manages the sprawling 17th-century property.\n\nPitt and Jolie -- now separated -- bought the property in the southern Provence region in 2008 and the actors were married in its chapel in 2014.\n\nThe multi-million dollar project to illuminate the 40-room chateau and three outbuildings involved as many as 17 full-time workers at one point but was not covered by a contract, according to the French daily Liberation.\n\nThe renovation of the chateau ran smoothly for two years, by which time it ran up 25 million euros in costs, Liberation reported, before technical problems and delays began cropping up, culminating in a billing dispute that brought payments to a halt.\n\nPitt and Jolie have been ordered to pay nearly 450,000 euros to the administrator of Soudant's company Lumieres Studio to pay unpaid bills and compensate for harm to its reputation, the sources said.\n\nIn addition, Chateau Miraval must pay 60,000 euros to Soudant herself for harm to her reputation and some 8,000 euros in unpaid fees.\n\nIt owes another 50,000 euros in court costs.\n\nSoudant headed the lighting section of prominent French architect Jean Nouvel's studio before setting up Lumieres Studio in 2009.\n\nIt was this connection that prompted Pitt -- an avid fan of Nouvel to the point of naming one of his daughters Shiloh Nouvel -- to seek out Soudant for the work, Liberation reported.\n\nLiberation said Soudant intends to pursue the dispute further for alleged copyright infringement.\n\n\"Brad Pitt bankrupted my company and appropriated my work,\" she told the paper, saying Pitt claims authorship of the lighting at the property, which spreads over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of woodland and vineyards near Aix-en-Provence.\n\nAccording to Liberation, she has also warned the French perfumer Guerlain over an advert featuring Jolie at the chateau that includes shots of the actress on a stairway for which Soudant designed the lighting.\n\nPitt and Jolie said in March that despite their separation they did not intend to sell the chateau.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

lighting designer they employed for their chateau in southern France. -- AFP picPARIS, Aug 18 -- A French appeal court has ordered US stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to pay \u20ac568,000 (RM2.86 million) to a lighting designer they employed for their chateau in southern France, judicial sources said today.\n\nThe court ruled on April 19 in favour of Odile Soudant, whose company went bankrupt, in the dispute with Chateau Miraval, the firm that manages the sprawling 17th-century property.\n\nPitt and Jolie -- now separated -- bought the property in the southern Provence region in 2008 and the actors were married in its chapel in 2014.\n\nThe multi-million dollar project to illuminate the 40-room chateau and three outbuildings involved as many as 17 full-time workers at one point but was not covered by a contract, according to the French daily Liberation.\n\nThe renovation of the chateau ran smoothly for two years, by which time it ran up \u20ac25 million in costs, Liberation reported, before technical problems and delays began cropping up, culminating in a billing dispute that brought payments to a halt.\n\nPitt and Jolie have been ordered to pay nearly \u20ac450,000 to the administrator of Soudant's company Lumieres Studio to pay unpaid bills and compensate for harm to its reputation, the sources said.\n\nIn addition, Chateau Miraval must pay \u20ac60,000 to Soudant herself for harm to her reputation and some \u20ac8,000 in unpaid fees.\n\nIt owes another \u20ac50,000 in court costs.\n\nSoudant headed the lighting section of prominent French architect Jean Nouvel's studio before setting up Lumieres Studio in 2009.\n\nIt was this connection that prompted Pitt -- an avid fan of Nouvel to the point of naming one of his daughters Shiloh Nouvel -- to seek out Soudant for the work, Liberation reported.\n\nLiberation said Soudant intends to pursue the dispute further for alleged copyright infringement.\n\n\"Brad Pitt bankrupted my company and appropriated my work,\" she told the paper, saying Pitt claims authorship of the lighting at the property, which spreads over 400 hectares of woodland and vineyards near Aix-en-Provence.\n\nAccording to Liberation, she has also warned the French perfumer Guerlain over an advert featuring Jolie at the chateau that includes shots of the actress on a stairway for which Soudant designed the lighting.\n\nPitt and Jolie said in March that despite their separation they did not intend to sell the chateau. -- AFP", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

17th-century property.\n\nPitt and Jolie -- now separated -- bought the property in the southern Provence region in 2008 and the actors were married in its chapel in 2014.\n\nThe multi-million dollar project to illuminate the 40-room chateau and three outbuildings involved as many as 17 full-time workers at one point but was not covered by a contract, according to the French daily

In the 12 years since the launch of the first Chromecast, the company has come out with a new device only every three or so years. In fact, I reviewed the last model, which was the Chromecast with Google TV in 2020.\n\nThe new Google TV Streamer is a completely reimagined device with a new design, remote, and capabilities that make it more suited for homes with more smart home devices, as well as a world where AI might soon dominate everything. I had a chance to go hands on with the Google TV Streamer. Here are my first impressions.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer costs $99, and is available for preorder today (Aug. 6) and will go on sale on September 24 at Google and other retailers. It comes in two colors: Porcelain and Hazel, the latter of which is a grayish color, which will be only available in the U.S. Google Store.\n\nBoth the Chromecast with Google TV (4K) and Chromecast with Google TV (HD) will still be available at select retailers while supplies last, according to Google. The company will continue to support all existing Chromecast devices with ongoing updates.\n\nInstead of a dongle-like design used with all previous Chromecast devices, the Google TV Streamer is a small wedge-shaped box that's designed to sit below your TV. As a result, it's no longer as inconspicuous as earlier generations, but its low profile means it won't protrude as much as, say, the Fire TV Cube, or even the Apple TV 4K. Still, if you have one of the best soundbars sitting in front of your TV, you're going to have to find space for the Google TV Streamer.\n\nAs with other Chromecast devices, the Google TV Streamer needs USB power to work. On the back of the device is a USB-C port, along with one HDMI 2.1 port and an Ethernet port, a nice addition for those who have issues with buffering on their Wi-Fi network. Sadly, you'll need to provide your own HDMI cable.\n\nAlso on the rear of the device is a small button that will cause the remote to start beeping. This feature is super-handy if you're prone to losing remotes in your couch cushions.\n\nInside, the Google TV Streamer has 32GB of storage, four times that of the Chromecast with Google TV, so you shouldn't have to worry about deleting apps to make room for new ones.\n\nGoogle also gave its remote a little bit of a redesign. While it still has the rounded bottom and sides as its current remote, the rear now has a textured back, so it feels a bit more comfortable to hold.\n\nThe button layout has also changed. Instead of putting the volume controls on the side of the remote, they're now on the front -- where they should be. The top of the remote still has a circular d-pad, but below it are now the back and Home buttons. Below them are the audio-related buttons: One to summon Google Assistant, Mute, and a volume rocker.\n\nBeneath those are buttons to pull up YouTube and Netflix -- the same as before -- but the bottom row now has a power button and a customizable button, which can be configured to either launch an app, switch inputs or bring up the Google Home panel.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Google is also integrating its AI, with the aim of helping make it easier for you to find something to watch.\n\nThe interface will provide Gemini-powered summaries and overviews of shows with ratings -- hopefully it won't spoil anything -- and will also curate content based on your preferences. Because you can set up multiple profiles, each family member can also get a customized list of what Gemini thinks they'd like to watch. Additionally, you'll be able to ask more in-depth questions and create watchlists.\n\nFor those times when you're not watching TV, you'll be able to use generative AI to create custom screensavers for your TV.\n\nThe larger size of the Google TV Streamer allowed the company to add a Thread border router into the device, so not only is it Matter-compliant, but it also has the potential to be one of the best smart home hubs, especially if you're invested in the Google ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, the Google TV interface is being updated so that you can control your smart home devices right from your TV. A panel that's modeled on the smart home panel on the Google Pixel Tablet will slide out from the right side of your TV, where you can then turn your smart lights on and off, change your smart thermostat temperature, and view feeds from your home security cameras and video doorbells.\n\nSimilar to what's already available with the Fire TV and Apple TV, if someone rings your doorbell, a notification will pop up on your TV, and you'll be able to see a live view of whoever's at your door.\n\nGoogle would not confirm if this interface would be exclusive to the Google TV Streamer, or if it would roll out to other compatible devices, such as the best Google TVs.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is a much-needed refresh for Google's streaming devices category, and now gives the company a premium offering to compete with the pricier devices from Amazon and Apple.\n\nI do hope that Google keeps the current Chromecast with Google TV 4K in its lineup, as not everyone will need or want the extra smart home features that come with the Google TV Streamer. Plus, the smaller (and cheaper) Chromecast with Google TV is much better suited for secondary TVs in your home, or if you want to take a streaming device with you while you're traveling.\n\nI'm also curious to see how accurate Gemini's recommendations will be for me and the rest of my family. Decision paralysis is a real thing with so many streaming options today, and, given my and my wife's wildly divergent tastes, I'm hoping that Gemini might be able to suggest something we both like.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_prospero@tomsguide.com", "name": "Mike Prospero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Store", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-definition television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Nest (smart speakers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundbar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soundbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D-pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethernet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Fire_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Fire TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9RqdCmE8m92ZCjnkgnmDE-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 671, "textEnd": 677}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 702, "textEnd": 714}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

That changes today with a refresh that also discontinues the Chromecast brand.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is the newest and now only first-party Google TV media hub. It takes the smart TV platform and features of the 4K Chromecast With Google TV and adds new functions, some of which based around Google's Gemini AI bot.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is obviously built around Google TV, which means it covers all major streaming services including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube, and supports local streaming from Android phones and Chrome tabs using Google Cast. It also features the Google Assistant voice assistant, accessible by speaking into the remote. It doesn't have hands-free control like many Google TV-based TVs, the Amazon Fire TV Cube, and Roku Ultra.\n\nInstead of the back-of-the-TV dongle design of Chromecast devices, the Google TV Streamer is designed to sit in front of your TV. The remote is still connected through Bluetooth and doesn't require line-of-sight with the hub, but it still benefits from having the Google TV Streamer physically accessible without reaching around the back of your TV. It incorporates a remote finder button similar to the one found on the Roku Ultra, which makes the remote produce a sound to help you locate it. The remote itself has also gotten a slight makeover, and now has a programmable shortcut button. Internally, the Google TV Streamer has a faster processor than the Chromecast With Google TV, twice as much memory, and 32GB of storage.\n\nSince the Google TV Streamer is larger than a Chromecast, it adds an Ethernet port for wired connectivity. That's a nice upgrade if you can run a cable to it, but it masks a shortcoming in the new media hub. The Google TV Streamer supports dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, or Wi-Fi 5.\n\nIt's a fast, reliable, and common Wi-Fi connection that most users can take advantage of with their current router. but Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) can be faster and more reliable, and it's becoming more popular. Wi-Fi 6E and even Wi-Fi 7 are also picking up steam. The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and Apple TV 4K both support Wi-Fi 6, and it seems like a significant omission for the Google TV Streamer.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer does, however, function as a Threads border router and can serve as a Matter smart home hub. Smart home control with Google TV has long been available through Google Assistant, but the Google TV Streamer expands on that with its onboard smart home functions and a new Google Home menu that provides on-screen controls similar to the controls on Android's Google Home panel.\n\nGoogle also announced new browsing and control functionality using its Gemini AI. It claims the Google TV Streamer will better curate content using Gemini, and offer AI-generated summaries of TV seasons.\n\nAt $99, the Google TV Streamer is twice as expensive as the 4K Chromecast with Google TV, and as the Chromecast line's replacement it leaves a budget-streamer-shaped hole in Google's catalog. It's the same price as the Roku Ultra and a bit cheaper than the Apple TV 4K, but Roku also offers the Streaming Stick 4K and Amazon offers the Fire TV Stick 4K, both of which are $50.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer can be preordered today, and ships Sept. 24.", "source": {"uri": "me.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Mag Middle East"}, "authors": [{"uri": "covering_both_tvs@me.pcmag.com", "name": "Covering Both TVs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dolby_vision@me.pcmag.com", "name": "Dolby Vision", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dolby_atmos@me.pcmag.com", "name": "Dolby Atmos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Set-top box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-definition television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_me/news/g/google-tv-/google-tv-streamer-replaces-chromecast-in-media-hub-lineup_c8f6.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 3604, "textEnd": 3612}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

It's pricier than the Chromecast at $99.99 / \u00a399 / AU$159.99, but boasts a list of features that should see it run laps around Google's previous streaming devices.\n\nMaybe the biggest change, though, is that it isn't designed to be hidden around the back of your TV. Instead, it's a slim, rounded rectangle that looks like a phone wireless charger, with three ports and plenty of horsepower to run Google TV smoothly, and also to let you easily control your smart home. It plugs into your TV via an HDMI port.\n\nThe Google TV streamer is a modern-looking device that's available in either Porcelain or Hazel finishes, both of which will stand out in a sea of competing black, rounded box-like media streamers. Google's game plan is really in the features, though, with the TV Streamer pulling double duty as a streaming player and smart home hub.\n\nOn the rear you'll find three ports: a USB-C port for power, an Ethernet port for wired connectivity, and an HDMI 2.1 port for connecting to a TV. When connected, it can stream 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, with support for HDR, HDR10, HDR10+, HLG, and Dolby Vision video standards alongside Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby Atmos audio standards, to make the most your TV's HDR and sound capabilities.\n\nThe Google TV interface will be familiar to anyone who's used a Chromecast with Google TV, or a TV that boasts the same platform, such as the Sony Bravia 9 or TCL QM851G. It's easy to view content available from all your connected services in one place, and it should run smoothly, because the TV Streamer is powered by a new processor, which Google says is 22% faster than the Chromecast with Google TV, and which is paired with 4GB of RAM for processing and 32GB of onboard storage.\n\nGoogle TV will lean on personalized recommendations, in a way that resembles Amazon's redesigned Prime Video app. For example, if you're a fan of comedies, it might toss a few romantic comedies into one of your main bars to try and entice you. It will also personalize recommendations for different members of the household based on which profile is signed in.\n\nGoogle is also using its Gemini AI to write summaries for movies or TV shows, and to curate and summarize reviews to give you a sense of what other viewers think about content they've watched.\n\nLike a Fire TV or a Samsung Frame TV, you can display photos or works of art on your TV through the Google TV Streamer. Google will even let you create a custom screensaver using generative AI - you can simply describe a scene and the AI will generate a result.\n\nAlso baked into Google TV is a Smart Home panel that's reminiscent of the Google Home app, and which gives you easy access to adjusting the temperature on a Nest thermostat, viewing footage from Nest cameras, and creating smart home routines.\n\nMoreover, the Google TV Streamer can help your connected devices stay online and even help you set up new ones, as it's a fully-feature smart home hub with a Thread Border router built in, making it fully compatible with Matter.\n\nWhile the remote is similar to the Chromecast with Google TV remote, it's a bit longer, and better weighted for a more comfortable user experience. It also gets a new 'star' button at the bottom, which is a custom button that you can map to opening a specific app or use to jump into the Smart Home panel. There's the same built-in microphone as before for easy communication with Google Assistant.\n\nMaybe the best addition here is the Find My Device integration - you can ask a Google smart speaker or a Pixel phone to find your remote, or physically click the button on the back of the Google TV Streamer to ping the remote. Either option is sure to save you some time digging between the couch cushions.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is much more premium device that its predecessors in terms of its design and features. The question is whether it's worth the price, and we're eager to go hands-on with it for our review, but it's worth noting that it costs less than the Apple TV 4K, and is on a par with the Roku Ultra, so looks like a good addition to the world of the best TV streaming devices.\n\nIf you're already sold, preorders are open now, with shipping from September 24.\n\nIf you'd rather save some money and buy or update a Chromecast, Google is currently discounting it with Google TV 4K and HD.

With AI smarts, it curates content across subscriptions for personalized viewing and offers smart home controls. The new design features a sleek oblong body and improved remote layout, making it a premium addition to your entertainment setup.\n\nIt's only been two weeks since we first heard concrete leaks about an upcoming Chromecast upgrade, and lo and behold, Google has already made the streaming device official.\n\nThe new-gen device, which is a step above the HD and 4K Chromecast models, is officially called the Google TV Streamer, and like everything Google does these days, it includes AI-enabled features to curate content and offer personalized recommendations.\n\nRelated Google TV Streamer is likely the next-gen Chromecast we've all been waiting for\n\nA much-needed switch to set-top box design\n\n6\n\nThe new streaming device, which is coming to a store near you starting September 24, costs $100, marking a 233 percent, or $70 increase over the current Chromecast HD and a 100 percent, or $50 increase over the current Chromecast 4K. To justify the higher cost, the new streaming device does pack a lot more in, including features and video formats not seen in the Chromecast 4K, though we're not sure if we'd recommend pre-ordering it just yet based on the specs alone.\n\nSource: Google\n\nBarring the AI integration (more on it below), the Google TV Streamer supports HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG video formats, all of which are also supported on the Chromecast 4K. However, it also boasts Dolby Vision, which should offer a wider range of colors and deeper blacks when viewing supported content, when compared to regular HDR.\n\nElsewhere, support for Bluetooth 5.1 should also mean improved audio quality when connected to external speakers, and extended range, while higher 32GB/4GB storage and RAM should mean more space for apps paired with faster loading times and a more responsive experience.\n\nGoogle TV Streamer\n\nOperating System Android TV OS Resolution 4K at 60FPS HDR support Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, HLG\u202c Audio codecs Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Atmos RAM/storage 4GB/32GB CPU \"22% faster than the previous generation\" Ports USB-C (power/data), HDMI 2.1 (Type A), Ethernet (10/100/1000Mbps\u202d) Connectivity Wi-Fi 5 (2.4/5GHz), Bluetooth 5.1, Thread border router Integrations Matter, Google Home Downloadable Apps Google Play Store Remote Bluetooth, IR, microphone, and the following buttons: D-pad, Select, Home, Back, Volume, Power, YouTube, Netflix, Play/Pause, Assistant, and\u202c \u202dCustomizable\u202c. Price $100 Expand It doubles as a smart home hub Source: Google\n\nApart from serving its role as a central hub for all your content needs, the Google TV Streamer's home screen will offer you smart home controls with built-in Thread support and Matter compatibility. \"The home panel lets you check your cameras (see who's there when your Nest Doorbell rings!), adjust the lights and temperature, close the blinds and more -- without leaving your couch,\" wrote Google in its press release about the streamer.\n\nAlthough we don't know this for certain, at first glance, it looks like the smart home control panel will be nestled at the top right of your Google TV home screen, alongside the settings gear icon. It should offer controls for lights and thermostats, paired with a slider to customize smart light brightness, and a live view of compatible Nest cameras.\n\nAccording to the tech giant, the streamer will automatically sync with your Google Home app, which essentially means that all compatible smart home gadgets in your house should be available to control via the new device right after its initial setup.\n\nAI smarts in tow Close\n\nThe tech giant says that the Google TV Streamer will be able to curate content based on your preferences across all of your content platform subscriptions, and organize them conveniently in one place. We're expecting this to be situated somewhere in the For You section of the home screen. \"You can even build watchlists with recommendations for every member of your home,\" wrote Google.\n\nIn addition, Google also stated that the streamer will make it easier to get full summaries, reviews, and season-by-season breakdowns of shows powered by AI, and from the looks of it, this information will show up on the content's card, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\nSource: Google\n\nElsewhere, like the Chromecast, the Google TV Streamer, too, offers an ambient mode, complete with time, weather, photos, and a new AI image generator to turn an idle TV screen into a work of art.\n\nA new design Close\n\nThe Google TV Streamer features a remote almost identical to the Chromecast's remote. It is still oblong in shape, albeit with volume buttons now relocated to the face of the remote, instead of being tucked away on the right like a smartphone. Another small change worth mentioning is that the voice assistant button now sits where the home button used to, with all other usual buttons, including Netflix and YouTube buttons, placed below.\n\nAvailable in Porcelain and Hazel (US Google Store exclusive), the device is meant to be placed in front of your TV, and not tucked behind. \"We designed Google TV Streamer to sit in front of your TV, rather than tucked behind it, to improve connectivity across your smart home devices,\" explained Google. The body of the device itself is oblong too, and it looks sleek and premium at first glance. However, we're unsure if users would prefer its bigger footprint over the compact Chromecast. We'll share our detailed thoughts about the new streamer in a review soon.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is available to pre-order now for $100 on the Google Store. It will be available on September 24.\n\nGoogle TV Streamer\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is a new set-top streaming device from Google that improves upon the Chromecast 4K.

But with the new Google TV Streamer, Google finally has a proper set-top box for binging content that also supports a much broader range of smart home controls.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change for the Google TV Streamer is switching from a simple dongle that hangs off your TV to a truly standalone device that lives on your media console. Google says its wedge-shaped design is meant to blend in easily with your decor when sitting in front of your TV so that it offers better reception for its included remote and other smart home devices (more on that later).\n\nGoogle has also given the Streamer TV a massive hardware upgrade compared to the Chromecast with Google TV from 2020, including a 22 percent faster CPU, double the RAM (4GB instead of 2GB) and four times more storage (32GB total). That might not sound like a ton, but considering that the previous model often ran out of space for downloading basic streaming apps, that's a much-needed improvement. Streaming resolution caps out at 4K/60fps, though you do get support for HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and spatial audio (when paired with Google Pixel Buds).\n\nFurthermore, there's an HDMI 1.1 jack, a powered USB-C port and a dedicated Ethernet slot for people who want peak bandwidth for streaming. Google also made the remote a touch longer while moving the volume rocker to the top and adding a customizable button that can be set to launch your favorite app, switch inputs or summon the new smart home control center. And just like before, there's a built-in microphone and a button for summoning the Google Assistant.\n\nThis brings me to the Google Streamer's improved smart home capabilities. Not only does it support Matter, it also features a built-in Thread border router for easily communicating with the other devices in your house. On top of that, the TV Streamer is getting its own version of the Google Home panel (which we've seen on previous Pixel phones and Nest Hubs) so that it's easier to adjust things like smart lights while also giving you the ability to view feeds from your security cameras and video doorbells.\n\nFinally, it wouldn't be a 2024 Google device without some new AI features. Thanks to Gemini, the TV Streamer can create custom recommendations based on the kind of content you watch and generate summaries, reviews or even season-by-season breakdowns for stuff you haven't. There's also an ambient TV mode that allows you to pull screensavers or memories from your Google Photos library. However, if you want something a bit more unique, you can also use AI to generate something fantastical. Meanwhile, if you lose the remote, you can ask the Google Assistant (not Gemini) to help you find it or you can simply press the dedicated button on the back of the box.\n\nSo while I haven't had much chance to dive into its features, with the new TV Streamer, at last it feels like Google has a significantly more capable smart home hub that's also a true rival to the Apple TV 4K and other Android-based boxes like the NVIDIA Shield TV. The Google TV Streamer costs $100 and is available for pre-order today with official sales beginning September 24.

More info.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is all sorts of official this morning as the next-gen streaming device from Google that will act as the needed upgrade from the Chromecast with Google TV. It's bigger, more powerful, has a new form factor, and yes, is more expensive. For those bought-in to the Google ecosystem, this will probably be a device to get.\n\nWhat is Google TV Streamer: Priced at $99.99, the price is double that of Google's dongle options, but it has upgrades everywhere. Google says it presents a \"giant leap in performance,\" thanks to a new and \"improved\" processor (22% faster CPU), 32GB storage, and double the RAM (4GB). You should see faster app load times and smoother navigation as you move about it. Anything has to be better than the Chromecast with Google TV, right?\n\nResolution drops in at 4K HDR and 60fps with a USB-C port for power, HDMI 2.1 for your TV connection, and an ethernet port for those with that kind of network setup. You'll also find Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby Atmos support, as well as Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG. 802.11ac is onboard too, as is Bluetooth 5.1 and Google Cast.\n\nUnlike the old Chromecast devices, this thing is meant to sit on a TV stand or shelf and be seen. You could try to mount it on a wall to hide it, but it's not as small as those old devices that used to tuck nicely behind your big screen.\n\nGoogle TV and AI: This is 2024 and Google is launching a hardware product, so you know AI ties-in somewhere. Google is using Google AI to help curate content suggestions from all of your subscriptions in Google TV. They should show up \"conveniently in one place\" within the UI. Google is also using Gemini to give you summaries, reviews, and season-by-season breakdowns of content.\n\nUsing other AI powers, Google create screensavers using generate AI that can display on your TV, turning it into a bit of an art machine. You can also use your Google Photos as a screensaver too.\n\nA Google Home hub: The Google TV Streamer supports Matter connectivity and has a Thread router, so it can act as your home hub. You can easily connect supported smart home devices to it, plus it has a new Google Home panel built into the UI to let you control your smart home from Google TV. You'll find lighting controls, camera feeds, climate devices, automation shortcuts, and everything else from Google Home in this panel. It looks like this.\n\nNew Google TV remote: There's a new remote with the Google TV Streamer that has apparently be redesigned based on your feedback. It sports improved ergonomics, which probably just means that it's larger and easier to handle.

Google is reportedly replacing its popular Chromecast 4K with a new streaming device called the Google TV Streamer.\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, Google will unveil the Streamer at its August event. This new set-top box will become the flagship Google TV device, offering a powerful alternative to the well-loved Chromecast.\n\nNow we are learning a little about the price. According to a report from Dealabs, the streaming player will cost \u20ac119.99 or roughly $129.99 USD. That would make it more than double the $49.99 price of the current 4K streaming player, although Google often prices things higher in Europe.\n\nWhile the Chromecast's dongle design has been popular, the Google TV Streamer will adopt a more traditional set-top box format. This move comes after the success of Walmart's Onn 4K Pro, demonstrating consumer demand for affordable yet powerful 4K streaming options. You can find photos of the new streaming player on 9to5Google's website HERE.\n\nThis price point may be a hard sell with the Walmart Onn Google TV Pro device priced at $49.99.\n\nThough the exact specifications remain unknown, images of the Streamer have surfaced online. The device is expected to feature a slightly updated remote and deliver top-notch streaming capabilities.\n\nGoogle's Chromecast has long been the go-to for many streamers, but the Google TV Streamer aims to take its place as the ultimate streaming companion.

Meet the just-as-awkwardly-named Google TV Streamer. It's available for preorder now for $100 and will ship on September 24.\n\nThat the price is twice that of Chromecast with Google TV should service notice that this is more than that old dongle. Same goes for the fact that it looks entirely different. This isn't a dongle. Or a stick. Or a puck. Instead we get a much bigger device, though Google is quick to mention how sleek it is and that it \"fits right into your home's decor without standing out.\"\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt's definitely going to stand out, though -- because it's doubtful that you have anything else that looks like it. It might well be mistaken for a wireless router, especially since you'll see at least two cables sticking out the back. One's USB-C for power and data, and the other is for HDMI. (You'll have to provide the latter yourself.)\n\nThere's a third option, though, that Google doesn't actually show in any of its promo images, and that's for Ethernet. And gigabit Ethernet, at that. While that kind of speed probably is overkill for most folks, it's important if you're doing any local playback -- as in watching movies on a home network. (And I'm always just a fan of being able to plug in whenever possible.) If you're in a wireless-only situation, though, the dual-band radios should serve you just fine with the Wi-Fi 5 standard. (That's 802.11ac, for those not using the new nomenclature.)\n\nOne more reason you'll tend to think Google TV Streamer is better than Chromecast with Google TV -- Google itself says so, calling it a \"faster, more premium version.\" It still supports 4K resolution, of course. It's also good for Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HDR 10+, and HLG. On the audio side is support for Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby Atmos. But the thing we're hoping to really notice is that Google says the new hardware is some 22% faster than its predecessor. One of our biggest complaints about Chromecast was that it always felt underpowered, with the user interface suffering from all kinds of hiccups. Hopefully this helps with that. It also has 4GB of RAM, and four times as much storage at 32GB. (Though the actual usable amount of storage will be less.)\n\nGoogle says the voice remote has been redesigned. It looks pretty much the same in pictures, but Google is quick to point out that it's easier to use and is more comfortable to hold, probably thanks to the addition of some texture on the back. And like the popular Onn 4K Pro, the remote has a customizable button that can be used to launch an app or switch inputs on the TV, or you can set it for some smart-home functionality. And perhaps even more important is that there's a button on the back of the Google TV Streamer to force the remote to start ringing, should you not be able to find it.\n\nAnd speaking of smart-home functionality, Google TV Streamer serves as a hub with the Matter smart home protocol. (And Thread, too.) That means faster and better response time since commands won't have to go through the Internet and back before they're implemented.\n\nAll in all, Google TV Streamer sounds like a good upgrade, and probably one that justifies the higher price.

In a blog post, the company highlights that this new \"entertainment and smart home hub\" gives you access to YouTube TV, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, and more.\n\nAdditionally, there are a plethora of free, live TV options, which Google states reach nearly 800 channels.\n\nCompared to the Chromecast dongle, the Google TV Streamer offers twice the memory and 32GB of storage. Google states such internal enhancements should aid the box in loading apps much faster. Plus, users can utilize 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos for clear, crisp, and well-pronounced sound and visuals.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer includes the company's redesigned remote control, featuring a textured back and a restructured button layout. The company states users can program the new customizable button to open their frequently-used apps or to switch inputs. Users can also rediscover the remote through Google Assistant's voice functionality, instead of digging through the couch.\n\nOther additions include Google's implementation of its AI model, Gemini. The company states its AI will make it \"even easier\" to find what you should watch next. Through the TV Streamer, Gemini will piggyback off your \"preferences\" to create a curated selection of content it thinks you might enjoy.\n\nThese suggestions will be based on movies and shows available to viewers through their subscriptions. The AI will also display reviews, summaries, and \"season-by-season\" breakdowns to help viewers make an informed choice.\n\nAfter connecting a Google account, users can dive into their Photos album and use it in the Sreamer's Ambient mode. This will create a screensaver that's a trip down memory lane or users can lean on Gemini for an AI-generated piece of art instead. Google adds that users can connect their TV Streamer to their internet via Wi-Fi or an ethernet cable.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer has another side which is the availability of smart home control options. Users can control various smart home devices from their living room, like Google's devices or those with Matter support. With hands-free capabilities, users can turn off their lights or start automation. The box doubles as a Thread border router, giving users more reach and reliability for their smart home devices.\n\nAlternatively, users can utilize the TV Streamer's \"Google Home panel,\" which lets them view a live feed of their connected camera, alter the temperature, and more. Google states the box's smart home support works well with its new Nest Learning Thermostat, too.\n\nThe TV Streamer isn't losing its casting feature as users can start something on their Android phone and then throw it onto the TV.

It was a small dongle that attached to the HDMI port of your TV, allowing you to cast content from a phone, tablet, or laptop to your TV. However, it looks like it's time to bid farewell to the Chromecast. Google has since announced its replacement, the Google TV Streamer.\n\nWe actually heard rumors of the device back in July where renders revealed what it could look like. We get that some of you might be sad to see the Chromecast go, but maybe the Google TV Streamer could be a worthy replacement. In addition to being able to cast content to it, the device acts as a hub for entertainment and smart home controls.\n\nFor starters, the device will provide users with access to a bunch of streaming services. This includes YouTube TV, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, and more. Obviously you'll require a subscription to those services to access their content.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Google is adding AI smarts to the device. By leveraging its Gemini AI technology, users will be able to get AI summarized content of their shows, reviews, breakdowns, and more. It also supports 4K HDR with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos and comes with 32GB of memory.\n\nAs a smart home hub, the device is Matter compatible. This will allow you to control various smart home devices through the Google Home panel, all directly from your TV. If you own a video doorbell, you can also use it to see who's at the door.\n\nIf you're interested in the Google TV Streamer, it is priced at $99.99. It is available in Porcelain and Hazel color finishes. It is also bundled with an accompanying remote. Pre-orders are now live via the Google Store and will be available for purchase on the 24th of September.", "source": {"uri": "phandroid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phandroid - Android News and Reviews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_lee@phandroid.com", "name": "Tyler Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Nest (smart speakers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Store", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Atmos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Atmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hazel-Google-TV-Streamer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 1733, "textEnd": 1750}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

That update is coming later this year.\n\nAfter the original in 2013, Google released a 2nd-generation in 2015 along with the Chromecast Audio. The Chromecast Ultra arrived a year later, with the 3rd-generation launching in 2018. Two years after that the Chromecast with Google TV (4K) arrived and that was followed by the HD version in 2022.\n\nGoogle no longer believes people need or necessarily want cheap streaming devices.

Not only did Chromecast with Google TV add a remote that people were clamoring for, but a full operating system focused on surfacing and recommending content.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer solidifies and finalizes that shift.\n\nThat said, Google not having a sub-$100 streaming device is unexpected, with the gap between the upcoming $99 device and the $29 Chromecast with Google TV HD stark.

The Streamer will also have access to over 800 channels, according to Google.\n\nThe AI features are powered by Gemini. This will allow users to view summaries and reviews of TV shows as they select something to watch. Gemini will also curate content for users, across all subscriptions, based on their viewing habits, and let users build watchlists with AI recommendations.\n\nGoogle is clearly making a play for more visible space in your media room because the Steamer is significantly bigger than the Chromecast. Its predecessor would dangle behind the TV, but the new device is supposed to sit on the TV stand and be part of the streaming furniture.\n\nPart of that size increase is down to improved specifications, such as 4GB of memory, 32GB of storage, HDMI 2.1, a 22% faster processor and an ethernet port.\n\nThe Streamer will also bring some smart home features to TVs. The device has connectivity support for Matter standard and a Thread border router, which should mean a simpler way to connect smart home devices from different companies. Google says this will result in faster response times and enhanced reliability.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements on the Chromecast is the new Google Home panel. Owners of video doorbells will now be able to view the camera feed on their TV, adjust lights, or change the house temperature. These are a long-requested features from Google Home users.\n\nThe Home panel will also come with some improved Nest Aware features. Later this year Gemini will be able to recognise specific scenes from smart home video feeds. The company gives examples of using the camera activity search in the Google Home app to ask \"did the kids leave their bikes in the driveway?\" Or, \"did my dog go near the cookies?\" These features will come to Nest Aware subscribers in the Public Preview later this year.\n\nEverything happens through a redesigned voice remote that has a new slimline profile and textured back for improved grip. There is a programmable button to open a user's preferred app and a chime option if it gets lost, which is activated by a button on the back of the Streamer, or asking another Assistant-enabled device to find it.\n\nThe Google Streamer will be available to buy from the Google store on September 24th for $99.99.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Set-top box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Nest (smart speakers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethernet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Router (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b21650ee13a5724ceb3ecd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=4236,3411,x989,y100,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 2642, "textEnd": 2656}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Streamer also has Gemini-enhanced search capabilities, which can also curate recommended titles for watchlists.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is compatible with Google Home and Matter devices, and can control an array of appliances directly from the menu on your TV, as well as programming routines for them.\n\nThe device will also be able to display your Google Photos in a slideshow, serving as an ambient mode while not directly in use. Users can verbally ask the device, via the remote or a separate Google Home device, to show photos from a specific time period or location to call up certain images.\n\nThe Streamer is 4K HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos-enabled. It's more powerful than the most recent Chromecast with Google TV and offers more storage capacity at 32GB. It also runs Google TV.\n\nGoogle's Gemini AI search eliminates the need to search content through specific apps and will recommend titles based on your streaming subscriptions and preferences.\n\nAt $100, the Google TV Streamer now competes with other premium devices, including the Roku Ultra ($100), AppleTV 4K ($129) and the Nvidia Shield TV ($150).

A new report claims to reveal the price of the Google TV streamer -- and don't expect it to be in the same ballpark as the Chromeast it's replacing.\n\nAs spotted by 9to5Google, the French site Dealabsclaims that the Google TV streamer will cost \u20ac119 in Europe, roughly $131 going by current conversion rates. (Companies often set specific prices for specific regions.) The existing Chromecast with Google TV sells for \u20ac69 in France.\n\nCurrently, the most expensive model of Chromecast you can buy in US is the Chromecast with Google TV with 4K for $49. (The HD version sells for $29.99.) In comparison, Apple's Apple TV 4K is available for $129 for the Wi-Fi only version or $149 for the Wi-Fi and Ethernet variant.\n\nBased on leaked images, the new Google TV streamer offers a more angular and rounded look than the Apple TV box. The device reportedly features an upgraded Chromecast remote with new buttons, including a programmable Star button.\n\nRumors claim Google could announce the streaming device tomorrow (August 6), but the device could also be on the agenda for the Made by Google event a week later, given that it's supposed to showcase new Google hardware. Either way, according to the French site, Google's set top box won't show up on retail shelves until September 24.\n\nDealabs' rumor also mentions this streamer will only be available in a white color -- more specifically, \"porcelain.\"\n\nThe current iteration of the Chromecast has existed since 2020 with the last released streaming device being the Chromecast Google TV (HD) which came out in 2022.\n\nChromecasts might not exist much longer,as Google has been quietly dropping the Chromecast branding with the company removing the \"Chromecast built-in\" moniker earlier this year.

The device aims to one-up the existing Chromecast lineup by offering an enhanced viewing experience while also serving as a versatile smart home hub.\n\nThe device's standout feature is the inclusion of a Thread border router. Thread is a low-power wireless networking protocol that works in tandem with Matter, which is the new universal smart home standard. The Thread integration allows the Google TV Streamer to ensure seamless setup and control of Matter-compatible smart home devices, from lights and switches to thermostats and security cameras.\n\nA key advantage of having Thread built into the streamer is that all Matter-compatible devices will work seamlessly over either Wi-Fi or Thread. This can help reduce the load on your Wi-Fi router by not routing all smart home traffic through it. Moreover, the Google TV Streamer eliminates the need to purchase a separate Matter hub, which is often a significant expense while setting up a smart home.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer's design as a set-top box, as opposed to the dongle design of previous Chromecast devices, is intentional. Google emphasizes the importance of placing the device in an open area to maximize its capabilities as a Thread border router.\n\nBeyond its hardware capabilities, the Google TV Streamer features a Google Home panel that appears directly on your TV screen, offering a user-friendly interface reminiscent of the Google Home app and Nest Hubs. This panel lets you control your smart home devices from your TV, whether you're adjusting lighting, managing thermostats, or checking live feeds from security cameras.\n\nAnother highlight is the new remote that comes with the streamer, which features a customizable button that can be set as a shortcut to the Google Home panel, providing quick access to smart home controls.\n\nAt $100, the Google TV Streamer is more expensive than previous Chromecast models. However, the combination of advanced streaming capabilities and integrated smart home features may justify the higher cost for many users. The device is scheduled to begin shipping in September, so there's a bit of a wait before you'll be able to get your hands on one.", "source": {"uri": "androidauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Authority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google Nest (smart speakers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Router (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_router", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wireless router"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermostat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Set-top box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Automation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Automation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Cable_Modem", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Cable Modem", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-TV-Streamer-plugged-in.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Today, the company unveiled its latest smart thermostat. It arrives on the same day as a next-gen version of Google's iconic Chromecast streaming dongle -- now called the Google TV Streamer.\n\nBoth devices have a bit of artificial intelligence spruced in -- Google Assistant is getting some assistance from the company's Gemini large language model -- along with long-awaited hardware improvements, and elegant designs that better blend the tech into your home. They arrive just a week before the Made by Google event on August 13, where the company is expected to announce new Pixel phones, smartwatches, and earbuds.\n\nGoogle has sold more than 100 million Chromecasts since 2013. Anish Kattukaran, head of product at Google Home and Nest, says while the dongle served the need of the previous generation of streaming fans, the new Google TV Streamer is future-facing. Instead of a small dongle hiding behind your screen, it's a slim elongated oval device designed to rest on a media console. It comes in two colors, porcelain and hazel, though the latter is a Google Store exclusive.\n\nOn the back of the Streamer are several ports where you can connect cables for Ethernet, HDMI 2.1, and USB-C for power. A gentle curve on the back of the device blocks any wires from sight. There's also a button that, once pressed, makes an audible ping on the remote to help you find it. (It's probably between the couch cushions.) The remote looks similar to the one included with the previous generation Chromecast With Google TV, but slightly longer. Some buttons have moved to be more ergonomic; volume, for example, is now on the front rather than the edge of the remote.

And it's a major one.\n\nThe device will not only feature a wedge-shaped box form factor vs. the legacy HDMI dongle, it will also pack a more ambitious range of features into a package priced twice as high ($99.99) and streeting Sept. 24 (with preorders starting Tuesday).\n\nThe Google TV Streamer will feature a more robust CPU, running 22% faster than the one in Chromecast with Google TV, as well as 32 gigabytes of storage, four times as much as the legacy gadget.\n\nThere will be support for 4K HDR with Dolby Vision, in addition to Dolby Atmos sound.\n\nNotable is the inclusion of a voice remote and Gemini AI tech in the gadget, giving the Google TV Streamer a leg up in the race to make search and recommendation more effective.\n\nFor a decade, streaming services and gadget makers have been pledging to cut down on the time users spend looking for something to watch. As one of the elite tech makers in the fast-developing -- and scary! -- world of artificial intelligence, Google would seem to have a leg up on what could ultimately be a Holy Grail tech feature when someone finally gets it solved.\n\nSpeaking to Next TV last week, Shalini Govil-Pai, VP and GM of Google TV, acknowledged that no one in the technology business has fully \"gotten it right\" yet in terms of search and recommendation.\n\nFor its part, the Streamer will blend algorithmic science with \"Gemini overviews,\" AI-fueled scourings of the internet that deliver essential programming info like plot synopsis, reviews aggregations, thematic appropriateness for kids, etc.\n\nThe AI tech also has other uses. For example, lots of connected TV devices make use of the modern low-power LED smart TV display to function as \"always on\" curators of family photos, classic paintings and other renderings.\n\nThe Streamer lets users make suggestions into their voice remotes -- on mashups of artistic classics, say -- to come up with all sorts of crazy AI-based digital imagery.\n\nAlso factoring into the Streamer's agenda is integration into Google's smart home universe via inclusion of Threads radio hardware.\n\nThe gadget can function as a central part of a smart home environment, dimming lights and responding to smart doorbells.", "source": {"uri": "nexttv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Multichannel News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_frankel@nexttv.com", "name": "Daniel Frankel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_factor_(design)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Form factor (design)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Atmos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Atmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_doorbell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smart doorbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SJdjcbxpLKD4mmgkKvfsFb-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 745, "textEnd": 753}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Alongside enhanced hardware, the Streamer introduces innovative software features to the Google TV experience, powered by Google's Gemini AI.\n\nWith Google TV, you can already browse an entire library of free streaming content, including 700,000 shows from over 800 free channels, without using any streaming apps. If you're into live TV, there's a dedicated tab for that, too, aggregating content from sources like YouTube TV and free channels from Pluto TV and Tubi.\n\nGoogle thinks it has cracked the code on that as well. Utilizing the power of Gemini, Google TV can now offer AI-powered recommendations based on a blend of Google's artificial intelligence and user preferences. This means viewers would receive tailored content suggestions from across all their subscriptions, making it easier to discover new shows and movies.\n\nAdditionally, Google TV will be able to create personalized watchlists for each household member, which would presumably require multiple profiles to be set up within Google accounts and streaming apps.\n\nGoogle claims that Google TV's new AI overviews will do just that, summarizing plots, user reviews, and even flagging content that might not be suitable for everyone. We'll have to see how accurate and helpful these AI summaries actually are in practice, given that Google's AI overviews for Google Search didn't do that well.\n\nOn the visual front, Google TV is introducing a new Ambient mode. Previously, the device displayed user-submitted pictures or screensavers when idle. The new feature will allow you to use AI to generate custom wallpapers or screensavers, adding a personal touch to your TV's downtime.\n\nIt's unclear which older Google TV or Android TV devices will receive these updates (if any) or when that might happen, but the features will likely remain exclusive to the new Google TV Streamer for some time to keep it ahead of the pack.

The Google TV Streamer is a 4K set-top box that's more expensive than the Chromecasts that it replaces.\n\nIt starts with a pill-shaped face that's at an angle that connects to an equally oblong base. The Google TV Streamer is available in Porcelain (white), while the US Google Store is offering an exclusive Hazel (dark green) model. Both colors are meant to be neutral to match your home.\n\nOn the rear, you'll find HDMI 2.1, Ethernet (10/100/1000 Mbps), and USB-C, though that port is intended for power. The device isn't very tall and designed to be tucked away with easy to hide wires.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer is powered by a chip that has a 22% faster CPU with 4 GB of RAM (double the 2020 model), and 32 GB of storage (for a 4x increase). It supports 4K HDR at 60 FPS with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Spatial Audio is available on supported content when you pair Pixel Buds Pro.\n\nThere's Bluetooth 5.1, Wi-Fi 802.11ac (2.4 GHz / 5 GHz), and a Thread radio for direct smart home communication.\n\nIn fact, the company sees this Google TV Streamer as the center of your smart home that helps connect Matter accessories. Besides serving as a hub, there's a new Google Home panel in Quick Settings. Similar to the experience on Android phones and the Pixel Tablet, there's quick access to your Favorites, with the ability to adjust lights, see camera streams, and trigger routines. You also have access to the Cameras, Lighting, Climate, and Wifi pages up top.\n\nThe Voice Remote with an IR blaster is mostly the same, but you get another row of buttons and textured back for improved grip. After the D-Pad, you have back and home keys side-by-side. The Google Assistant-branded button has been replaced by a generic microphone that has a nub to make it easier to find, while volume up/down is next with the rocker on the right edge going away. This is joined by a convenient mute button.\n\nNext to the USB-C port on the back is a Find My Remote button. This will play a chime on the remote to quickly find the controller, while you can also trigger that sound in the Google Home app or \"Hey Google, find my remote\" on other Assistant devices.\n\nShortcuts for YouTube and Netflix are next, with power and the \"Magic\"/star shortcut rounding things out. That customizable button can be used to open an app, change inputs, or the Google Home panel.\n\nIn terms of software, Google TV will show Gemini Overviews on content listings, like \"What's it about,\" \"What people are saying,\" and \"What to know.\" It can provide \"full summaries, reviews and season-by-season breakdowns of content.\" Another generative AI feature is the ability to generate custom screensavers that match your home.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer (4K) costs $99 in a $50 increase from the 2020 Chromecast. In the box, you get the Google TV Streamer, Voice Remote (with 2 color-matched AAA batteries included), power adapter, and USB-C power cable (1.8 m). No HDMI cable is included.\n\nPre-orders begin today with availability set for September 24.", "source": {"uri": "9to5google.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Google"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abner_li@9to5google.com", "name": "Abner Li", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Nest (smart speakers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Store", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Set-top box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethernet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Tablet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel Tablet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D-pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_blaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infrared blaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surround sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Atmos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Atmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/08/Google-TV-Streamer-cover.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 3110, "textEnd": 3122}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It also costs $50 more than the 4K Chromecast, so while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying the price of an Apple TV 4K box you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending quite a bit more than before for the latest Google TV features. The company told Gizmodo it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning to sell the Chromecast for now, but the dongle will eventually die out in favor of the TV Streamer.\n\nThe dongle may not be completely done for\u00e2\u20ac\"not yet anyway\u00e2\u20ac\"though the new box will have a few exclusive UI features that may or may not come to previous devices. The Streamer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting exclusive access to a big-screen version of the Google Home panel that will let you access your home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cameras or smart lights. The device is also Matter compatible, which should mean a more connected smart home suite.\n\nThe TV Streamer, however, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come with any mounts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to lay flat on your TV console and blend in with your surrounding decor, so long as you appreciate the off-white porcelain color (the hazel color is exclusive to those who buy on Google Store). Just know there are only three ports, a USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really not supposed to hide the box, especially since it's 6 inches long and is supposed to be your living room smart home hub.\n\nPerhaps the most important feature for us scatterbrained folk is the ability to use Google Assistant to find your lost remote. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dedicated button on both Google Home and the TV Streamer itself to ping your remote, which then beeps so you can find it wedged between the sofa cushions. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also find the remote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been redesigned to add a more prominent Assistant button and offer a dedicated volume rocker right on the front face.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re playing the Google AI drinking game, then time to take a shot. The Mountain View tech giant is forcing Gemini AI to serve on its streamer. For one, users can expect AI-generated summaries and breakdowns of content when getting it through Google TV. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UI will also summarize reviews of each show or movie. You can also change up your ambient mode using a voice prompt.\n\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly a market for 4K streaming, but for folks like me who only stream in HD the price on this updated box is too thick a bone to chew through. At the very least, Google will support older Chromecasts to some degree, but it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made any specific promises on that front.\u00c2\n\nThe $100 TV Streamer is going on preorder starting Tuesday and it will start shipping Sept. 24.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_barr@gizmodo.com", "name": "Kyle Barr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google TV (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromecast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HDR10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Nest (smart speakers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HDR10+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-definition video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/08/Google-TV-Streamer-set-up.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794785", "eventUri": "eng-9794785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-24", "textStart": 3902, "textEnd": 3910}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

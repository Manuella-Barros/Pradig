A crew was on site when the tower fell, Transpower confirmed to 1News.\n\n\"The tower carries two separate high capacity circuits, carrying most of Northland's power needs.\"\n\nIt fell while a second transmission circuit supplying these areas was out of service for scheduled maintenance, Transpower said.\n\n\"At this stage we do not know what the cause for the tower falling was. There will be a full investigation, but our priority now is restoring power to the region.\"\n\nTranspower executive general manager of grid delivery Mark Ryall told 1News it can get around 70% of Northland customers back on the grid without having to restore the circuit damaged on the tower that fell.\n\nAs a system operator, Transpower has reconfigured the power system to provide power from local sources, including the Ng\u0101wh\u0101 geothermal station near Kaikohe.\n\nIn a post to social media, Northpower said it was \"working hard to find the fault, and we hope that power will be restored soon\".\n\nTranspower said a service provider was onsite to assess the damage and determine how long it would take to return the circuit to service.\n\nTop Energy's outage map showed widespread cuts impacting more than 32,000 customers in the Far North.\n\n\"Some areas are now running on backup generators. Please conserve power,\" Top Energy said on its website.\n\nNorthpower also reported widespread outages across the greater Maungatapere, Poroti, the greater Whang\u0101rei Central, Whang\u0101rei Port area, Marsden Point, One Tree Point, Ruak\u0101k\u0101, Mata, Waipu, Waipu Cove, and Braigh.\n\nA map on its website showed the extent of the outage.\n\nVector also reported a number of unplanned outages north of Auckland.\n\nA farmer who leased the land where the pylon fell told 1News he was in bed sick when he heard \"a bit of a crash\".\n\n\"I didn't think a lot of it, but then my daughter came in and said 'we've got no power',\" said Shane Hood.\n\nHe said he inspected the property by car and found the pylon slumped down in a paddock.\n\n\"My first thought was, I hope nobody is up there and luckily there wasn't.\"\n\nHe said there had been people working on the pylon around the time it fell and \"thankfully none of [the] livestock were in danger\".\n\nThe New Zealand Transport Agency said people should consider delaying their journey or expect delays and possible diversions following reports of downed power lines on SH16 in the Glorit area between West Coast Rd and Kaipara Hills Rd.\n\nThe outages occurred following a period of heavy rain in which MetService warned residents of the potential for surface flooding and slips.\n\nTranspower is calling on people living in areas from Warkworth northwards who have power to \"conserve it until full electricity supply can be restored to the region\".\n\nIn an update this evening, Transpower said it was able to restore some power to Northland but \"it is unable to supply all of the region and will instruct local lines companies to reduce power use on their networks where necessary\".\n\n\"A time for returning full supply has not yet been determined but it will take until late tomorrow at the very earliest. We will provide an update tomorrow morning when we have further advanced engineering of options.\n\n\"People from Warkworth northwards who do have power can help by conserving power, enabling the available supply to go further.\"\n\nPeople can save power by turning off heaters and lights in rooms that are not in use, use large appliances sparingly, and charge electric vehicles only as needed.\n\nIt said the crew working on the tower before it fell \"are safe and unharmed\".\n\n\"We are grateful for the patience and support of the landowners whose property we are working on.\n\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience caused and assure those impacted that we are working to restore power to everyone as quickly as possible.\"\n\nVector customers in Warkworth, Wellsford, Snells Beach, and Big Omaha have also been asked to ration energy until 9pm \"to reduce the likelihood of outages being required\", a Vector spokesperson told 1News.\n\n\"While we don't yet know if rolling outages will be necessary, or for how long, if they do occur, they will be temporary, and will occur at different times to ensure that no one is without power for an extended period.\u202fWe have already communicated directly with customers who may be impacted.\n\n\"We recommend customers in the impacted areas charge devices and power banks and keep a torch handy.\n\n\"We thank customers for their understanding as Transpower works to repair the damaged tower. \"\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Council has urged residents to conserve water, warning that \"some areas may run out completely\".\n\nIn a post to its Facebook page, the council said in a statement that the power outage meant the water-supply network was running at a \"reduced capacity\".\n\n\"It is a good idea to fill a bottle and a bucket in case the outage lasts a long time.\"\n\nWhang\u0101rei mayor Vince Cocurullo told 1News that Northland has \"had a few\" of these types of events in the last couple of years.\n\n\"When the Brynderwyns went out, Cyclone Gabrielle, and today of course when the power line gets dropped.\"\n\nHe said power security was one of the key challenges facing the region, alongside transport and water.\n\n\"We've managed to sort [water] out, it's the other two now which we're still waiting for central Government and the agencies to sort out.\"\n\nCocurullo said Northland shouldn't have to rely on one power line and that the region needs to \"at least have a fault line\".\n\n\"We've heard about Ng\u0101wh\u0101 having the upgrades down there. However, for Northland we need to be looking at generation of power outside of those, maybe ocean generation or wind generation.\"\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Councillor Scott McKenzie shared an image to X, formerly Twitter, of councillors meeting in a \"dark and acoustic\" room.\n\nKokopu School near Whang\u0101rei asked parents to \"please come and pick up your children\" at around midday on Thursday.\n\n\"School is closing due to no toilets and no power\".\n\nEarlier, a school in the Northland town of K\u0101eo closed for the day following a night of heavy rain in the region.\n\nKaeo School said it was closed as buses were \"unable to run\".\n\n\"Please stay safe and dry,\" the post said.\n\nBusinesses across the region have also been forced to close or cancel services due to the power outage.\n\nNorthland police have urged the community to be patient on the roads and take care at intersections.\n\n\"Police are currently managing traffic on the main roads, and at intersections where traffic lights [are out],\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"There will be a visible police presence in business areas across the Northland District.\"\n\nMotorists have been asked to travel \"only if necessary\" and to avoid the Whang\u0101rei CBD area.\n\nNorthland Civil Defence earlier warned residents in the Far North to plan ahead if they were travelling through K\u0101eo, the Waimate North area, Taipa, Mangonui, and State Highway 1 at Larmer Rd in the Kait\u0101ia area.\n\nIn an update shortly before 10am, it said \"the worst of the rain has now passed for Northland\".\n\nThe earlier orange heavy rain warning and severe thunderstorm watch have both been lifted.\n\nNew Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi Northland said \"due to a multiple large slips and dropouts\" a lane is closed on State Highway 1 between Kitchen Rd and Makene Rd through the Mangamuka Gorge.\n\n\"Please use SH10 until further notice and allow extra journey time.\"", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz",

Probe launched into region's mass power failure", "body": "Why did tower fall? Probe launched into region's mass power failure\n\nNearly 100,000 people spent the day without electricity in Northland after a transmission tower linking the region to the rest of the country collapsed.\n\nPower was restored to most of the region yesterday evening, but consumers were asked to conserve electricity and warned their hot water cylinders would remain off while the amount of energy getting into the area was limited.\n\nThe tower was undergoing maintenance work when it fell yesterday morning but questions remain on the cause of the collapse.\n\nThe country's grid provider Transpower issued a grid emergency notice. It was the second such notice issued this year after there was a shortage of generation during a cold snap in May and a solar storm two days later.\n\nThe impact of the power outages on Northland also comes after the region suffered through Cyclone Gabrielle last year, along with more subsequent heavy rain compounding issues and severing transport links throughout 2023.\n\nSome Northland businesses closed early yesterday and others only accepted cash as trading continued in the dark. Students at a number of schools were sent home early.\n\nPolice officers directed traffic at some intersections and the New Zealand Transport Agency reminded motorists to follow give-way rules at all other junctions while the traffic lights were out.\n\nGenerators kicked in at Whang\u0101rei, Dargaville, Bay of Islands and Kait\u0101ia hospitals.\n\nThe loss of power meant water supplies were cut and people around the region were asked to conserve how much they were using. There were reports of residents stocking up on bottled water at supermarkets.\n\nThe transmission tower collapse,which happened in Glorit, Auckland, about 45km west of Warkworth, happened at the same time another circuit connecting Northland to the grid was down for maintenance.\n\nThe downed Transpower tower in Glorit, Auckland, which resulted in the electricity link for Northland being severed. Photo / Louise Owen\n\n\"[This] highlights how fragile the infrastructure in Northland is,\" Northland MP Grant McCallum said. He said this was \"the last thing [Northlanders] needed\".\n\nEmergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell also said the situation raised questions about how resilient the region's infrastructure was. Civil Defence had been scrambled to help vulnerable communities.\n\nKaipara District Mayor Craig Jepson said he hoped the outage would not impact businesses too badly.\n\n\"People are really concerned about what's happening. I think we're pretty hard-bitten when things like this happen that we don't expect,\" Jepson said.\n\nFar North Mayor Moko Tepania said the widespread outage showed the importance of \"ensuring our connectivity is resilient\".\n\n\"Hopefully we can get that transmission line back up and join us back up to the main grid. It's not good enough for our entire region to be dependent on a single line.\"\n\nRod Emmerson's editorial cartoon on the power outage.\n\nMinister of Energy Simeon Brown said there would be an investigation into the incident to figure out why the transmission tower collapsed and how it cut power to the entire region.\n\n\"But the priority at the moment is making sure power is restored as quickly as possible, vulnerable people who rely on electricity are looked after, and working with electricity distribution businesses around how that power will be managed as they work through restoring power.\"\n\nBrown said crews were performing maintenance work on the tower when it collapsed.\n\nTranspower said it had launched a \"full investigation\" into why it fell. It confirmed there was a crew doing maintenance work on the tower and said the workers were unharmed as it collapsed.\n\nBrown said Transpower had taken some measures, including shifting load to another pylon, to get some electricity north through the alternative pylon.\n\nHe said another power station in Northland that was out for maintenance was brought back on yesterday afternoon to add generation.\n\nA transmission tower in Glorit, Auckland, collapsed at about 11am.\n\nTranspower spokesman Nathan Green said additional power came on stream last night, which meant most people should have had their power restored by 7pm.\n\n\"However, the power available is much less than we would normally have at this time of the evening. This means we need to leave the hot water off for everyone and ask that you continue to minimise your power use as much as possible.\n\n\"This ensures that as many people as possible can share in the reduced power we have available tonight.\n\n\"Transpower advises that the work required to restore supply from the fallen tower will take until at least tomorrow [Friday] afternoon, so please continue to conserve as much power as possible and stay prepared for further outages during this time.\"\n\nHe thanked customers for their \"patience, kindness, and support\".\n\n\"Please stay safe and keep an eye on those around you who may be struggling, especially if they are vulnerable.\"\n\nPeople in northern parts of Auckland were also asked to conserve electricity due to the fallen transmission tower. The region's lines company Vector said Transpower had warned it that it may have needed to cut power to some households to save power.\n\n\"We are asking customers in Warkworth, Wellsford, Snells Beach and Big Omaha to conserve power this evening to reduce the likelihood of outages being required,\" a spokesman for Vector said.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news",

Full power would not be restored until tomorrow night \"at the earliest\", he said.\n\nHe said this still left \"a significant impact\" on Northlanders for the next 24 hours.\n\nTranspower said a time for returning full supply has not yet been determined, but it \"will take until late tomorrow at the very earliest\".\n\nThe region lost power about 11am after a tower fell south of Wellsford while a second transmission circuit supplying these areas was out of service for scheduled maintenance.\n\nThe spokesperson said they were \"managing to restore\" some supply through the netword's 110KV circuits after the main 220KV circuits were affected.\n\n\"Transpower has launched a full investigation into why the tower fell. The tower was undergoing routine maintenance at the time. The crew doing the work are safe and unharmed. We are grateful for the patience and support of the landowners whose property we are working on.\"\n\nNorthpower spokeswoman Rachel Wansbone said close to 100,000 people were affected by the incident.\n\nMeanwhile, Auckland energy company Vector said it may need to \"ration energy\" for customers in Warkworth, Wellsford, Snells Beach and Big Omaha until 9pm.\n\n\"This could result in outages for some customers in this area. This is due to a fallen Transpower transmission tower, which is causing energy supply shortages north of Auckland,\" Vector said.\n\n\"While we don't yet know if rolling outages will be necessary, or for how long, if they do occur they will be temporary, and will occur at different times to ensure that no one is without power for an extended period.\u202fWe have already communicated directly with customers who may be impacted.\"\n\nEnergy Minister concerned failure took out entire region\n\nBrown said Transpower's priority was restoring full power and working with line companies to ensure they managed the load to ensure high-priority customers who needed electricity had it.\n\n\"Obviously, there are people who are medically dependent, that's critically important that they are looked after.\"\n\nHe said Civil Defence was set up and working with councils to get to vulnerable communities.\n\nTranspower was working through the options to restore the line, including whether they could put the original pylon back up or if a temporary pylon was needed.\n\n\"The priority is to restore the power and ultimately keep the lights on in Northland as quickly as possible.\n\n\"There will obviously be an investigation into the incident and what caused it, but the priority at the moment is making sure power is restored as quickly as possible, vulnerable people who rely on electricity are looked after, and working with the EBDs [electricity distribution businesses] around how that power will be managed as they work through restoring power.\"\n\nHe said it was a concern that such an incident took out power to an entire region.\n\n\"They were working on the site at the time, there was maintenance happening at the site but there will be an investigation to understand exactly what happened.\"\n\nBrown said Transpower had taken some measures, including shifting load to another pylon, to get some electricity north through the alternative pylon.\n\nHe said another power station in Northland that was out for maintenance was brought back on this afternoon to add generation.\n\nTrustpower's Nathan Green said additional power had come on stream tonight from Transpower NZ, which meant most people would have power restored over the next two hours.\n\n\"However, the power available is much less than we would normally have at this time of the evening. This means we need to leave the hot water off for everyone and ask that you continue to minimise your power use as much as possible.\n\n\"This ensures that as many people as possible can share in the reduced power we have available tonight.\n\n\"Transpower advises that the work required to restore supply from the fallen tower will take until at least tomorrow afternoon, so please continue to conserve as much power as possible and stay prepared for further outages during this time.\"\n\nHe thanked customers for their \"patience, kindness, and support\".\n\n\"Please stay safe and keep an eye on those around you who may be struggling, especially if they are vulnerable.\"\n\nNorthland MP Grant McCallum said it was \"devastating news\" for Northland and urged people to keep in touch with their power providers and watch for updates.\n\nMcCallum was informed by Transpower that it was working to get power restored as soon as possible.\n\n\"It highlights how fragile the infrastructure in Northland is, which is something we are very focused on strengthening.\n\n\"The people of Northland have been through a lot with storms and road closures. This is the last thing they needed,\" he said.\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Council advised people to conserve water as much as possible as the water supply network was operating at a reduced capacity.\n\n'I've got an oven full of half-cooked food'\n\nChris De-Ath from Bocky Boo Gelato said power was restored in central Whang\u0101rei just in time to save his gelato icecreams from spoiling.\n\nStaff packed the freezer with pillows to help the cold stay in. De-Ath said the power cut was the last thing the business needed.\n\nThe owner of Village Cafe in Kerikeri, Abby Semb said she had to close the cafe after she heard the power was going to be out most of the day.\n\n\"It's frustrating. I've got an oven full of half-cooked food for a catering job. As long as we get power later today, I won't lose all my stock.\"\n\nCafe Jerusalem is also having to turn away customers. Front of house staffer Michaela Surovcova said staff were waiting for the manager and cleaning to keep busy.\n\nJarred Meehan from Churchill Butchers and his team were serving customers in the dark with mobile eftpos.\n\nHe was waiting on a generator thinking: \"We'll be up and running again\".\n\nHowever, they could not use the machines with the generator.\n\n\"So some of the boys will be going home.\"\n\nYini Lan from Kerikeri Lunchbox Bakery said customers were transferring money online or writing their names and phone numbers in her book and returning later to pay.\n\nAt that stage she had filled three pages of IOUs.\n\n\"This is how I deal with it. I'm definitely affected but I've been here quite long so I know the majority of customers. It's better to feed them,\" Lan said.\n\nAt Whang\u0101rei Cafe Hello Pickle, workers Fynlee Connew and Ash Tadman were doing a deep clean with head torches on, as well as serving customers.\n\nOwner Jess Loftus said customers were paying with cash or bank transfer, while some regulars had been given a loan to pay back the next time they come in.\n\nLoftus said she was trying to make the most of a situation she can't control.\n\n\"It's cool to see the community banding together. I could see people helping the elderly cross the street ... everyone is driving so courteously and so aware, imagine if we operated like this all the time,\" she said.\n\nLoftus said the loss of trade was \"a bit stressful\" but the cafe is well supported by regular customers.\n\n\"We felt that through Cyclone Gabrielle and Covid, through times of unexpected spot problems, it's nice to see everyone coming together.\"\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Council said the major power outage affected many public services, including traffic lights, which had shut down.\n\n\"If you are driving, use normal give-way rules at intersections. There is also extra congestion, please take your time and be safe.\"\n\nMayor Vince Cocurullo commented on his social media post that the 220 tower was out and Transpower was currently restoring power through the 110 power supply system.\n\nMeanwhile, the power outage threw today's Whang\u0101rei District Council meeting into darkness.\n\nThe council's 11am community development committee meeting, chaired by Councillor Carol Peters, had just kicked off when the council chambers were thrown into darkness as lights, air conditioning and Te Iwitahi's council chamber's electronic sound system cut out.\n\nThe meeting continued, considering community funding grants allocation, community safety and more.\n\nCouncillor Ken Couper ended the meeting with his words: \"Guide us all safely home, especially with the power out.\"\n\nKaipara Mayor Craig Jepson said the region was vulnerable when these events happened.\n\n\"People are really concerned about what's happening. I think we're pretty hard-bitten when things like this happen that we don't expect.\"\n\nHe hoped there wouldn't be too much impact on businesses in the district and those in rural areas.\n\n\"Let's hope the cowsheds can continue operating this afternoon,\" he said.\n\nFar North Mayor Moko Tepania said the widespread outage showed the importance of \"ensuring our connectivity is resilient\".\n\n\"Hopefully we can get that transmission line is back up and join us back up to the main grid. It's not good enough for our entire region to be dependent on a single line.\n\n\"Especially when our power prices in this region are the highest in the country.\"\n\nTepania advised residents to conserve water and limit flushing the toilet, as many were on tank water. He also suggested having torches and candles handy in case the outage lasts into the night.\n\n\"Hopefully that won't be required.\"\n\nSome early childhood centres and schools across Northland were asking students to be picked up as the outage continues to impact toilet use and phone lines.\n\nWhang\u0101rei Girls' High School had asked parents to collect their children and busses are being organised early. Open Spaces Preschool in Whang\u0101rei had been forced to close as it could not maintain a suitable temperature in the centre and there was no running water.\n\nParents and caregivers should check school and ECE Facebook pages, and websites or call if they were unsure of closures.\n\nStaff at Pak'nSave Whang\u0101rei could not comment on the outage but when the Advocate visited, it looked like business as usual with a few trolleys filled up with drinking water.\n\nAnimates staff were also left in the darkness after a power outage.\n\nAnimates Whang\u0101rei staff first experienced the outage at 11am as acting manager Ashaia Muriwai was serving a customer.\n\nAs they went to pay, the power went out, she said.\n\nCash-only sales were continuing, however, customers were not allowed in the store due to health and safety. Staff were in good spirits when the Advocate visited, thanks to the company of Muriwai's dog, Athena.\n\nGenerators had kicked in at Whang\u0101rei, Dargaville, Bay of Islands and Kait\u0101ia Hospitals, Health NZ/Te Whatu Ora Te Tai Tokerau spokeswoman Liz Inch said.", "source": {"uri": "rsoe-edis.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "rsoe-edis.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We got through last night's peak power use time (5pm-9pm) with everyone conserving as much energy as possible, and by turning off the hot water.\"\n\nShe said credit also goes to large industrial customers like Fonterra and Golden Bay Cement among others who have limited their use of power and will continue to do so until Monday.\n\nTop Energy spokesperson Philippa White said while some \"pocket\" areas in the Far North may still be without power, the cause was not related to the Transpower issue.\n\n\"To our knowledge, everyone has got their power back. We have our generator on with additional support from Ng\u0101wh\u0101,\" White said.\n\nA Transpower spokesman said their engineering teams have been working hard to restore full supply to Northland.\n\n\"Our main focus is to restore the full supply as soon as possible. We like to clarify that we will soon launch an investigation and cannot talk further on what happened as it would just be speculation,\" he said.\n\nTranspower had initially hoped to be able to lift the fallen tower to restore one 220kV circuit by Friday afternoon.\n\nBut he said it was now clear that the best option was to put in a temporary tower and lift a circuit across to it.\n\n\"This is complicated and complex work, and it is now expected it will be completed late Saturday or early Sunday.\n\n\"Electricity demand is much less on weekends and Transpower expects that the 110kV line and local generation should be able to supply all of Northland over the weekend.\"\n\nThe spokesman said Lines companies will still be instructed to manage load during peak times on Friday due to the restrictions on the amount of power that can be supplied to the region.\n\n\"Transpower asks those in areas from Warkworth northwards who have the power to continue to conserve it during peak times on Friday (6am-9am and 5pm-9pm),\" he said.\n\nSome examples of how those in impacted areas who do have power can help during the peaks are:\n\n- Turn off heaters and lights in rooms you are not using.\n\n- Use large appliances sparingly (such as washing machines, dryers and dishwashers).\n\n- Charge electric vehicles only as needed.\n\nThe spokesperson said people with power should stay warm by heating the rooms they are using.\n\nHowever, they could consider turning down the temperature slightly (1-2C).\n\n\"We thank all those who conserved power last night to ensure as many people as possible could have power.\n\n\"We apologise to those impacted and assure them that we are working hard to fully restore power to everyone as quickly as possible.

It was the second such notice issued this year after there was a shortage of generation during a cold snap in May and a solar storm two days later.\n\nThe impact of the power outages on Northland also comes after the region suffered through Cyclone Gabrielle last year, along with more subsequent heavy rain compounding issues and severing transport links throughout 2023.\n\nSome Northland businesses closed early yesterday and others only accepted cash as trading continued in the dark. Students at a number of schools were sent home early.\n\nPolice officers directed traffic at some intersections and the New Zealand Transport Agency reminded motorists to follow give-way rules at all other junctions while the traffic lights were out.\n\nGenerators kicked in at Whang\u0101rei, Dargaville, Bay of Islands and Kait\u0101ia hospitals.\n\nThe loss of power meant water supplies were cut and people around the region were asked to conserve how much they were using. There were reports of residents stocking up on bottled water at supermarkets.\n\nThe transmission tower collapse,which happened in Glorit, Auckland, about 45km west of Warkworth, happened at the same time another circuit connecting Northland to the grid was down for maintenance.\n\n\"[This] highlights how fragile the infrastructure in Northland is,\" Northland MP Grant McCallum said. He said this was \"the last thing [Northlanders] needed\".\n\nEmergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell also said the situation raised questions about how resilient the region's infrastructure was. Civil Defence had been scrambled to help vulnerable communities.\n\nKaipara District Mayor Craig Jepson said he hoped the outage would not impact businesses too badly.\n\n\"People are really concerned about what's happening. I think we're pretty hard-bitten when things like this happen that we don't expect,\" Jepson said.\n\nFar North Mayor Moko Tepania said the widespread outage showed the importance of \"ensuring our connectivity is resilient\".\n\n\"Hopefully we can get that transmission line back up and join us back up to the main grid. It's not good enough for our entire region to be dependent on a single line.\"\n\nMinister of Energy Simeon Brown said there would be an investigation into the incident to figure out why the transmission tower collapsed and how it cut power to the entire region.\n\n\"But the priority at the moment is making sure power is restored as quickly as possible, vulnerable people who rely on electricity are looked after, and working with electricity distribution businesses around how that power will be managed as they work through restoring power.\"\n\nBrown said crews were performing maintenance work on the tower when it collapsed.\n\nTranspower said it had launched a \"full investigation\" into why it fell. It confirmed there was a crew doing maintenance work on the tower and said the workers were unharmed as it collapsed.\n\nBrown said Transpower had taken some measures, including shifting load to another pylon, to get some electricity north through the alternative pylon.\n\nHe said another power station in Northland that was out for maintenance was brought back on yesterday afternoon to add generation.\n\nTranspower spokesman Nathan Green said additional power came on stream last night, which meant most people should have had their power restored by 7pm.\n\n\"However, the power available is much less than we would normally have at this time of the evening. This means we need to leave the hot water off for everyone and ask that you continue to minimise your power use as much as possible.\n\n\"This ensures that as many people as possible can share in the reduced power we have available tonight.\n\n\"Transpower advises that the work required to restore supply from the fallen tower will take until at least tomorrow [Friday] afternoon, so please continue to conserve as much power as possible and stay prepared for further outages during this time.\"\n\nHe thanked customers for their \"patience, kindness, and support\".\n\n\"Please stay safe and keep an eye on those around you who may be struggling, especially if they are vulnerable.\"\n\nPeople in northern parts of Auckland were also asked to conserve electricity due to the fallen transmission tower. The region's lines company Vector said Transpower had warned it that it may have needed to cut power to some households to save power.\n\n\"We are asking customers in Warkworth, Wellsford, Snells Beach and Big Omaha to conserve power this evening to reduce the likelihood of outages being required,\" a spokesman for Vector said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, the power available is much less than we would normally have at this time of the evening.\"\n\nThe region lost power about 11am after a tower fell, south of Wellsford, while a second transmission circuit supplying these areas was out of service for scheduled maintenance.\n\nEnergy Minister Simeon Brown said Transpower had advised him they would be able to restore two-thirds of the electricity supply to Northland by yesterday evening. Full power would not be restored until tonight \"at the earliest\", he said.\n\nHe could not say what had caused the pylon to fall.\n\n\"There will obviously be an investigation into the incident and what caused it, but the priority at the moment is making sure power is restored as quickly as possible, vulnerable people who rely on electricity are looked after, and working with the EBDs [Electricity Distribution Businesses] around how that power will be managed as they work through restoring power.\"\n\nHe said it was a concern that such an incident took out power to an entire region.\n\n\"They were working on the site at the time, there was maintenance happening at the site but there will be an investigation to understand exactly what happened.\"\n\nNorthland mayoral forum leader Vince Cocurullo called for the power to be returned immediately and said he didn't want the issue to become \"another Brynderwyns\".\n\nCocurullo said the power outage would have widespread consequences and would also have significant economic impacts for many.\n\nMany business owners were among those affected by the outage. While some saw food being spoiled, others resorted to creative means to keep customers happy.\n\nYini Lan from Kerikeri Lunchbox Bakery said customers were transferring money online or writing their names and phone numbers in her book and returning later to pay. She filled at least three pages of IOUs.\n\n\"This is how I deal with it. I'm definitely affected but I've been here quite long, so I know the majority of customers. It's better to feed them.\"\n\nAnimates Whang\u0101rei staff first experienced the outage at 11am as acting manager Ashaia Muriwai was serving a customer. As they went to pay the power went out, she said. Staff were in good spirits when the Advocate visited thanks to the company of Muriwai's dog, Athena.\n\nAt Whang\u0101rei cafe Hello Pickle, workers Fynlee Connew and Ash Tadman were doing a deep clean with head torches on, as well as serving customers.\n\nOwner Jess Loftus said customers were paying with cash or bank transfer, while some regulars had been given credit and could pay the next time they come in.\n\nLoftus said she was trying to make the most of a situation she can't control.\n\n\"It's cool to see the community banding together. I could see people helping the elderly cross the street ... everyone is driving so courteously and so aware, imagine if we operated like this all the time,\" she said. Loftus said the loss of trade was \"a bit stressful\" but the cafe was well supported by regular customers.\n\n\"We felt that through Cyclone Gabrielle and Covid, through times of unexpected spot problems, it's nice to see everyone coming together.\"\n\nOwner of Village Cafe in Kerikeri, Abby Semb, said she had to close the cafe.\n\n\"It's frustrating. I've got an oven full of half-cooked food for a catering job. As long as we get power later today, I won't lose all my stock.\"\n\nChris De-Ath from Bocky Boo Gelato said the power was restored in central Whang\u0101rei just in time to save his gelato icecream from spoiling.\n\nStaff packed the freezer with pillows to help the cold stay in. De-Ath said the power cut was the last thing the business needed.\n\nCellini's icecream and espresso shop owner Richard Holt said his entire stock of icecream had melted - $5000 to $6000 worth of stock. He was resigned to the situation.\n\n\"It's shocking but I've got used to it. It is what it is in Northland.\"\n\nHolt said he had a back-up generator but couldn't get to the service station on time before it too shut due to the power outage. It will be another two to three days before he can restock.\n\n\"We won't be open tomorrow. Some shops might be able to reopen when the power goes out, but that's not the same for food service.\"\n\nCafe Jerusalem was also having to turn away customers. Front-of-house staffer Michaela Surovcova said staff were waiting for the manager and cleaning to keep busy.\n\nJarred Meehan from Churchill Butchers and his team were serving customers in the dark with mobile eftpos.\n\nHe was waiting on a generator, thinking \"we'll be up and running again\". However, the shop's machines couldn't be used with the generator \"so some of the boys will be going home\", he said.\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Council said the major power outage affected many public services including traffic lights which had shut down.\n\n\"If you are driving, use normal give-way rules at intersections. There is also extra congestion, please take your time and be safe.\"\n\nAt the intersection of Walton and Cameron Sts, police Detective Sergeant Dave Whitecliff-Davies was seen controlling traffic.\n\nNorthland MP Grant McCallum said it was \"devastating news\" for Northland and urged people to keep in touch with their power providers and watch for updates on when the power might be restored.\n\nMcCallum said Transpower told him they were working to get power restored as soon as possible.\n\n\"It highlights how fragile the infrastructure in Northland is, which is something we are very focused on strengthening.\n\n\"The people of Northland have been through a lot with storms and road closures. This is the last thing they needed,\" he said.\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Council advised people to conserve water as much as possible because after the power outage, the water supply network was operating at a reduced capacity.\n\nKaipara Mayor Craig Jepson said the region was vulnerable when these events happened.\n\n\"I think we're pretty hard-bitten when things like this happen that we don't expect.\"\n\nFar North Mayor Moko Tepania said the widespread outage showed the importance of \"ensuring our connectivity is resilient\".\n\n\"Hopefully we can get that transmission line is back up and join us back up to the main grid. It's not good enough for our entire region to be dependent on a single line.\n\n\"Especially when our power prices in this region are the highest in the country.\"\n\nTepania advised residents to conserve water and limit flushing the toilet, as many were on tank water. He also suggested having torches and candles handy in case the outage lasted into the night. \"Hopefully that won't be required.\"\n\nSome early childhood centres and schools across Northland asked students to be picked up as the outage continued to impact toilet usage and phone lines.\n\nSchools were also affected: Whang\u0101rei Girls' High School asked parents to collect their children early and Open Spaced Preschool was forced to close early as staff were unable to maintain a suitable temperature in the centre and they had no running water.\n\nEmergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell said Civil Defence and emergency management in Northland were monitoring the situation and ready to mobilise if it was required. He said he had not yet had any reports of people in trouble as a result of the power outage. He did not know how the pylon had fallen over, but said it did raise questions about the resilience of the infrastructure.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ

This is complicated and complex work, and it is now expected it will be completed late Saturday or early Sunday.\"\n\n\"Having one pylon, one line coming into Northland - it's just not good enough,\" Cocurullo told AM host Lloyd Burr.\n\n\"We need to work on resilience.\n\n\"We are asking people to be careful with the power usage between now and 10am, the peak time - just be sensible with the power.\"\n\nCocurullo said he understood Transpower was looking to either divert the power through lower-grade lines or put the pylon back up to help with supply and demand over the coming days.\n\nNorthpower also warned further outages could be on the cards, if people didn't conserve their power use.\n\n\"Over the coming days we will need to be working together to conserve energy and hot water controls will be in place to help keep the power within what we have available, particularly in the morning and evening peak use times - this is 5am until 9am and 4pm until 10 pm.\n\n\"We'll keep in touch as things progress but people should be prepared for the possibility of more outages, particularly if power demand exceeds what we have available.\"\n\nWatch the interview above.", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_bevan@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Darren Bevan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whang\u0101rei", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whang\u0101rei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpower_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transpower New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transmission tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northland Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northland Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northpower", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northpower"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Associations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Power_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Power Tools", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2024/06/whang-rei-mayor-says-it-s-not-good-enough-supply-goes-through-one-pylon-after-thousands-left-without-power/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1718912620420/am-mayor-power-210624-1120x640.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666472", "eventUri": "eng-9666472", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Please conserve power,\" Top Energy said on its website.\n\nNorthpower also reported widespread outages across the greater Maungatapere, Poroti, the greater Whang\u0101rei Central, Whang\u0101rei Port area, Marsden Point, One Tree Point, Ruak\u0101k\u0101, Mata, Waipu, Waipu Cove, and Braigh.\n\nA map on its website showed the extent of the outage.\n\nVector also reported a number of unplanned outages north of Auckland.\n\nA farmer who leased the land where the pylon fell told 1News he was in bed sick when he heard \"a bit of a crash\".\n\n\"I didn't think a lot of it, but then my daughter came in and said 'we've got no power',\" said Shane Hood.\n\nHe said he inspected the property by car and found the pylon slumped down in a paddock.\n\n\"My first thought was, I hope nobody is up there and luckily there wasn't.\"\n\nHe said there had been people working on the pylon around the time it fell and \"thankfully none of [the] livestock were in danger\".\n\nThe New Zealand Transport Agency said people should consider delaying their journey or expect delays and possible diversions following reports of downed power lines on SH16 in the Glorit area between West Coast Rd and Kaipara Hills Rd.\n\nThe outages occurred following a period of heavy rain in which MetService warned residents of the potential for surface flooding and slips.\n\nWhang\u0101rei District Councillor Scott Mckenzie shared an image to X, formerly Twitter, of councillors meeting in a \"dark and acoustic\" room.\n\nEarlier, a school in the Northland town of K\u0101eo closed for the day following a night of heavy rain in the region.\n\nKaeo School said it was closed as buses were \"unable to run\".\n\n\"Please stay safe and dry,\" the post said.\n\nNorthland Civil Defence earlier warned residents in the Far North to plan ahead if they were travelling through K\u0101eo, the Waimate North area, Taipa, Mangonui, and State Highway 1 at Larmer Rd in the Kait\u0101ia area.\n\nIn an update shortly before 10am, it said \"the worst of the rain has now passed for Northland\".\n\nThe earlier orange heavy rain warning and severe thunderstorm watch have both been lifted.\n\nNew Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi Northland said \"due to a multiple large slips and dropouts\" a lane is closed on State Highway 1 between Kitchen Rd and Makene Rd through the Mangamuka Gorge.\n\n\"Please use SH10 until

The slip-prone highway has been closed for four months for major repairs.\n\nFurther north, State Highway 1 at Mangamuka Gorge would not reopen until close to Christmas after being shut more than two years.\n\nFar North Mayor Moko Tepania said locals were \"bloody fed up\".\n\n\"It's not good enough for us, for our business, for our economy and everything in between.\"\n\nNorthlanders were resilient, but they should not have to be, Tepania said.\n\nWhang\u0101rei hairdresser Megan Edwards was also frustrated by the cuts, which brought her business to a \"standstill\".\n\nNorthland seemed particularly vulnerable to power cuts and she was sick of it, she said.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpower_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transpower New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warkworth,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warkworth, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warkworth, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Highway_1_(New_Zealand)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Highway 1 (New Zealand)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whang\u0101rei", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whang\u0101rei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Top Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northpower", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitaia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaitaia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaitaia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Far_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Far North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brynderwyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brynderwyn"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far North District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Far North District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangamuka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mangamuka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mangamuka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northland Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northland Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/North America", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--9BmrzUVD--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1718852646/4KOAA58_MicrosoftTeams_image_1_jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666472", "eventUri": "eng-9666472", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

It was not clear why the tower fell over.\n\nThe tower carried two separate high-capacity circuits that supplied most of the power to the remote Northland region, which has a population of 195,000. Officials suggested 180,000 people were without power, Radio New Zealand reported.\n\nPower had been restored to some through the use of a lower-capacity network, but most of the region's homes and businesses -- more than 70,000 -- were still without electricity hours after the outage, the two power companies servicing Northland told The Associated Press.\n\nThe region's emergency management agency advised residents to conserve water and New Zealand police urged people not to travel by road unless necessary.\n\nThe outage occurred just over a year after New Zealand's ageing power grid experienced its worst-ever damage during a deadly cyclone in February 2023, which battered Northland, cutting power to the region and devastating farmland.

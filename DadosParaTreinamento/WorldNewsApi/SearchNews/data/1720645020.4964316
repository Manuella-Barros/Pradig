The squid chef from 2020 DNC says he&#x27;s a Trump backer", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The \u201ccalamari comeback\u201d chef who delighted viewers of the last Democratic National Convention might not be coming back. John Bordieri was dubbed by some as the \u201ccalamari ninja\u201d for standing wordlessly, clad head-to-toe in black, and holding a platter of lightly buttered, saut\u00e9ed squid on a Rhode Island beach during a video roll call of states that formally made Joe Biden the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2020. Bordieri said he\u2019s not heard from state or national leaders about a repeat performance when Democrats gather again this summer in Chicago. He is planning to start a vacation when their convention opens on Aug. 19. And more importantly, he prefers former President Donald Trump to Biden - so organizers likely won\u2019t want him back, anyway. \u201cI\u2019m a Trump supporter, to be honest with you,\u201d Bordieri, 57, said in an interview during which he divulged for the first time publicly his true political sympathies and his plans to vote for the Republican in November. \u201cBut I was told to tell everybody that I\u2019m independent.\u201d The Democratic National Convention has announced plans to again nominate Biden via a virtual roll call before the in-person event formally begins. That\u2019s so it can satisfy an early ballot deadline set by Republican-controlled Ohio, even though state lawmakers there have since eased their rules. PHOTOS: No 'calamari comeback'? The squid chef from Democrats' 2020 convention says he's a Trump backer The convention floor in Chicago will still feature an in-person nominating process. But the coronavirus pandemic offered numerous lessons about using virtual content to modernize often staid norms. That\u2019s left political junkies - and at least some people who count calamari among their favorite foods - asking about whether they\u2019d see Bordieri again this year. Convention organizers said no programming decisions have been made. \u201cOur convention will pull in people across the country to showcase how President Biden and Democrats are delivering for Americans and lay out a vision for the future,\u201d said Emily Soong, a convention spokesperson. Rhode Island Democratic Party Chair Liz Beretta-Perik didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether Bordieri - or calamari more generally - will star in the Ocean State\u2019s plans at this year\u2019s convention. Bordieri said he\u2019s open to doing a video contribution similar to 2020\u2019s. But he\u2019s planning to be off during the convention and has no travel plans then, except to suburban Boston for an Aug. 25 concert by country star Kenny Chesney. His part in the 2020 convention was so memorable because many officials speaking for their states stuck to serious topics. They decried the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic or the virus-decimated economy under Trump, or otherwise promoted efforts to fight poverty or combat racial injustice. Rhode Island focused on squid - meant to highlight how its fishing industry was finding innovative ways to boost sales after COVID-19 shuttered restaurants and saw prices and demand for fresh catches fall. Then-Rhode Island Democratic Party chair Joseph McNamara, a state lawmaker who successfully lobbied to make calamari Rhode Island\u2019s official appetizer, taped the state\u2019s 30-second video contribution on Oakland Beach in Warwick, near Iggy\u2019s Boardwalk restaurant, where Bordieri is executive chef. Bordieri didn\u2019t speak. He only hoisted for the camera calamari with garlic, parsley and slices of cherry peppers. That\u2019s how it\u2019s most often served locally, sometimes with banana peppers as well. McNamara declared Rhode Island \u201cthe calamari comeback state,\u201d prompting immediate, snarky proclamations online that the appetizer had clinched the Democratic nomination - or that it had even won the entire 2020 election. Bordieri said he wasn\u2019t going for a ninja look, only wearing his normal black uniform, \u201cand I just happened to wear black gloves that day.\u201d When he arrived on the beach, he says, producers \u201clooked me up and down and said, \u2018You\u2019re going to be in the shot.\u2019\u201d He was instructed to wear a mask for filming and slipped on a black face-covering that only made him look more like a ninja. After the video aired on the 2020 convention\u2019s second night, the calls started coming by midnight, making Bordieri too excited to get much sleep. \u201cMy wife says, \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re trending!\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s trending?\u2019\u201d Bordieri laughed. He also quickly became acquainted with another term he\u2019d not previously heard, \u201cblowing up\u201d online. When he went to work in the morning, he recalled: \u201cThe phone\u2019s ringing all day long. The business phone. My phone. Reporters, TV, newspaper, radio, the whole nine yards. I was talking to everybody.\u201d And, of course, their calamari sales spiked. The crispy snack remains popular at Iggy\u2019s three locations around Rhode Island, which sell around 400 pounds per week. \u201cIf it\u2019s done right, and you use a good product, people are going to love it,\u201d he said. The hubbub from four years ago has mostly subsided. But Bordieri said a few buddies still call him the calamari ninja. \u201cIf we go out to dinner, if I\u2019m with these certain friends, they let everybody know that I\u2019m in the building,\u201d he said. \u201cI get a little embarrassed sometimes.\u201d", "summary": "The \"calamari comeback\" chef who delighted viewers of the last Democratic National Convention might not be coming back.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/8/no-calamari-comeback-squid-chef-from-writethru-1/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/08/Election_2024_DNC_Calamari_79448.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:55:34", "author": "Will Weissert", "authors": ["Will Weissert"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.411}

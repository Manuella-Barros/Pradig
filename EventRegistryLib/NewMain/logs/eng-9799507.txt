Youngkin Issues Executive Order Removing 'Noncitizens' From Voter Rolls, Establishing Prosecution Procedures", "body": "Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order on Wednesday with the goal of establishing better election integrity in the state.\n\nThe order calls for the exclusion of \"noncitizens,\" whom many refer to as foreign nationals or illegal aliens, while establishing better procedures to prosecute them.\n\nExecutive Order 35, which was issued by Youngkin's office, codifies election integrity in the state through a number of measures. These include improved voter machine testing, stricter ballot security protocols, and voter-list maintenance that fully detects and eliminates noncitizens from the voter registers. The action expands on his administration's past attempts to maintain election integrity, including an executive order from June that revised data-sharing agreements and expedited the removal of deceased voters from the rolls.\n\n\"The Virginia model for Election Security works,\" Youngkin said on Wednesday in a release that announced the order. \"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue.\"\n\n\"Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don't play games and our model for election security is working,\" he continued.\n\nAdditionally, the Virginia Attorney General announced on Wednesday that since taking on his role, his office had located and \"deleted over 6,000 noncitizens\" from the voter records.\n\nThere have been multiple confirmed instances of noncitizens enrolling on voter lists, Daily Caller reported.\n\nBy ordering the commissioner of the department of elections to confirm in writing that those who were unable to prove their citizenship will be removed from the state voter registration list, Youngkin's ruling expressly targets noncitizen involvement in elections.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) must additionally confirm an applicant's identity and legal status with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Social Security Administration database before granting them a driver's license.\n\nThe executive order specifies what to do when a noncitizen tries to register to vote. Among other things, it says that the attorney general of Virginia has \"full authority\" to enforce the state's election laws and to notify prosecutors when this occurs.\n\n\"We verify the legal presence and identity of voters using DMV data and other trusted data sources to update our voter rolls daily, not only adding new voters, but scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and non-citizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register,\" Youngkin said.\n\nIn July, President Joe Biden opposed a House GOP bill that sought to strengthen election integrity, claiming that concerns of noncitizen involvement in elections were \"easily disproven falsehoods.\"\n\nHowever, America First Legal filed a lawsuit on Tuesday in a related case across the United States, asserting that Maricopa County, Arizona, failed to remove noncitizens from its voter rolls.

Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order on Wednesday that aims to strengthen election security in the state, including the removal of noncitizens from voter rolls and establishing procedures to prosecute them.\n\nYoungkin's office issued Executive Order 35, which codifies election integrity in the state through a slate of measures, including tighter ballot security procedures, enhanced voter machine testing and voter-list maintenance that more thoroughly identifies and removes noncitizens on voter rolls. The order builds upon election integrity efforts made earlier in his administration, such as an executive order in June that updated data-sharing agreements and streamlined the removal of dead voters from the rolls.\n\n\"The Virginia model for Election Security works,\" Youngkin said Wednesday in a press release announcing the executive order. \"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue.\"\n\n\"Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don't play games and our model for election security is working,\" the governor continued.\n\nThere have been documented cases of noncitizens enrolling on voter lists, with the Virginia Attorney General on Wednesday announcing that his office has identified and removed more than 6,000 noncitizens on voter rolls since he entered office.\n\nYoungkin's order specifically targets noncitizen participation in elections by directing the Commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify in writing that individuals who were unable to verify their citizenship are to be removed from the statewide voter registration list. Before issuing a driver's license, the Department of Motor Vehicles must also verify an applicant's identity and legal status with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Social Security Administration database.\n\nThe executive order also outlines procedures for when a noncitizen attempts to register to vote, which includes notifying prosecutors when it happens and affirming that the Virginia Attorney General has the \"full authority\" to enforce the state's election laws.\n\n\"We verify the legal presence and identity of voters using DMV data and other trusted data sources to update our voter rolls daily, not only adding new voters, but scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and non-citizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register,\" Youngkin said of the order.\n\nThe governor's order follows growing efforts by Republicans to ensure illegal migrants and other noncitizens are not allowed to participate in federal elections, while many Democrats have argued that this is a made-up controversy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in July referred to claims of noncitizen participation in elections as \"easily disproven falsehoods\" in a public statement opposing a House GOP bill that aims to strengthen election integrity.\n\nIn a related case across the U.S., America First Legal sued Maricopa County, Arizona, on Tuesday for allegedly failing to remove noncitizens from its voter rolls, with the group claiming earlier this year that there were more than 35,000 registered voters in Arizona who have not provided proof of citizenship.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We do not mass mail ballots. We monitor our drop boxes 24/7.\n\n\"We verify the legal presence and identity of voters using DMV data and other trusted data sources to update our voter rolls daily, not only adding new voters, but scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and noncitizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register.\"\n\nYoungkin's office indicated over the last two years that nearly 80,000 deceased voters were removed from voter rolls via a \"comprehensive audit\" by conducting multiple National Change of Address mailings, which resulted in the removal of the deceased voters.\n\nIn addition, between January 2022 and July 2024, 6,303 noncitizens were removed from the voter rolls, according to the executive order.\n\nThe commonwealth is only one of three states in the country that require individuals to provide their full nine-digit Social Security number to register for voting. Youngkin's office added that over 90% of commonwealth voters electronically register to vote through the Department of Motor Vehicles ELECT.\n\nThe DMV \"requires applicants to submit proof of identity and legal presence for those that do not yet hold a valid Virginia credential.\"\n\n\"When issuing a credential such as a driver's license, DMV verifies applicants' proof of identity and legal status with the Department of Homeland Security Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database and the Social Security Administration database,\" according to the governor's office.\n\nIn addition, the order directs the commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify in writing annually that election security improvements are in place. Lastly, it also \"outlines the procedures in place for noncitizens who attempt to violate the law and register to vote,\" including referral to commonwealth attorney offices and the Office of the Attorney General.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sarah_roderick_fitch@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Sarah Roderick-Fitch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Center_Square", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Center Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_motor_vehicles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of motor vehicles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voting machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_Alien_Verification_for_Entitlements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social Security Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Identity document"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/glenn-youngkin-virignia-donald-trump.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799507", "eventUri": "eng-9799507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Glenn Youngkin.\n\nOn Wednesday, Youngkin signed an executive order instructing the Department of Elections to remove \"non-citizens who may have purposefully or accidentally registered to vote.\" Pursuant to the order, the state also identified and removed from voter rolls 79,867 deceased voters, and identified registered voters who had moved out of state.\n\n\"The Virginia model for Election Security works. This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue,\" Youngkin said in a statement. \"Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines.\"\n\nVirginia does not require voters to present identification at the polls, which allows unregistered voters to impersonate deceased individuals or others on the voter rolls.\n\nYoungkin's executive order notes that it is essential for different agencies' jurisdictions to work together to ensure clean elections. Virginia identified non-citizens using information submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles cross-referenced with Department of Homeland Security and Social Security information. Virginia entered into comprehensive data-sharing agreements with seven states and, has received data from 42 states.\n\nOther states could have a harder time purging non-citizens from voter rolls, however, because \"Virginia is one of only three states in the nation that require those registering to vote to provide their full 9-digit social security number.\"\n\nYoungkin's efforts to secure elections come after the Democrat-controlled legislature created extended early voting periods and mail-in voting. Youngkin said drop boxes are \"under 24/7 monitoring,\" but still called for \"strengthening state and federal law.\"\n\nHis executive order said that absentee ballots must only be mailed when requested by a voter, and that returned absentee ballots cannot be counted unless \"the last four digits of a voter's social security number and year of birth provided on the envelope are matched to the voter's record in the statewide voter registration system.\"\n\nThe order also requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to generate a daily file of non-citizen transactions, and instructs local registrars to notify county prosecutors when they become aware of an illegal immigrant's attempt to register to vote. The order made clear that Virginia's Attorney General \"has full authority to enforce election laws,\" and that the state will use only paper ballots going forward.\n\n\"In Virginia, we don't play games, and our model for election security is working,\" Youngkin said.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Respite_Care", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Respite Care", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/05/GettyImages-1780086166.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799507", "eventUri": "eng-9799507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Nearly 80,000 deceased voters were removed from the commonwealth's voter rolls in 2023 alone.\n\n'EVERY STATE SHOULD FOLLOW VIRGINIA'S LEAD.'\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, 6,303 noncitizens who are still alive and who either \"purposefully or accidentally registered to vote\" in Virginia have likewise been removed, the EO claimed.\n\nPlus, Virginia DMVs verify a person's legal status with databases for the Department of Homeland Security Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements and Social Security Administration before issuing credentials like a driver's license, and Virginia is one of just three states that require citizens to provide their full, nine-digit social security number to register to vote.\n\nEven mail-in ballots in Virginia cannot be counted unless the voter information listed on the outside of the ballot -- the last four digits of the voter's social security number and his or her date of birth -- match the voter's data in the state's voter registration system. So, the chances of other noncitizens slipping through the cracks and casting a vote there are greatly reduced.\n\nFinally, the EO compels the Virginia Department of Elections commissioner to submit an annual report to the governor certifying that all procedures have been followed regarding ballot security, counting machine testing, and a \"triple-check\" of the accuracy of all elections results.\n\nYoungkin is certainly proud of the EO and his state, claiming that Virginia has led the way in ballot security, counting machine reliability, and \"voter list maintenance.\"\n\n\"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue. Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don't play games and our model for election security is working,\" Youngkin said.\n\n\"The Virginia model for election security works.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who would love to earn Virginia's 13 electoral votes this November, likewise hailed Youngkin's EO and commitment to election integrity.\n\n\"The beautiful Commonwealth of Virginia, superbly led by Governor Glenn Youngkin, IS TAKING A STRONG LEAD IN SECURING THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER -- PROTECTING EVERY LEGAL VOTE AND KEEPING ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT HAVE BEEN LET INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM VOTING. All votes will be on paper ballots and counted safely and fairly, not by machines connected to the internet -- A big security risk. We must work hard to make sure the Election is FAIR and SECURE!!!

Glenn Youngkin is ordering the state Commissioner of Elections to certify that key election security measures already required by law and regulation are actually followed.\n\nA new executive order requires formal, annual certification that state and local election officials met existing state law and regulation requirements and that they complied with State Election Department guidelines.\n\n\"It really begins with the recognition that Virginia is the crucible of democracy, and therefore all Virginians who are eligible to vote, all Virginia citizens should vote,\" Youngkin told reporters Wednesday at an event to announce record state Lottery profits.\n\n\"With that, all Virginians who are voting, the citizens of Virginia, should be confident that the votes will be counted accurately, and the elections are fair, and that is at the heart of executive order,\" he said.\n\nThe order says the state elections commissioner now needs to certify to the governor that election results are triple checked.\n\nThis means, as state law and regulation now say, that officers of elections check results at the precinct level on election night, followed by checks performed by local electoral board in the days after an election and that state Department of Elections check what the local boards report though its own reviews and audits before certifying an election.\n\nYoungkin wants the commissioner to certify that the state list of registered voters is updated daily to add eligible voters and remove the names of voters who have moved, died, become ineligible because of a felony conviction or finding of mental incapacity and people who are not citizens.\n\nHe also directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine the legal status of people applying for driver's licenses, to make sure they don't apply to register as voters as part of the process of getting a license. DMV is also to speed information about non-citizen license issues to election officials.\n\nIn addition, the order says the election commissioner is to certify that:\n\nall equipment used in voting and in counting ballots, including electronic pollbooks, is tested before use;only paper ballots and paper ballot counting machines, rather than electronic voting machines, are used in Virginia elections;ballot counting machines are certified to state and federal standards and that they are not connected to the Internet and so are vulnerable to hackers;ballots are tracked through every step of voting and counting and certifying election results;there is a documented chain of custody for ballots with daily updates during early voting;absentee ballots can only be mailed when a registered voter asks for one;\n\nregistrars match the partial Social Security number and date of birth information on an absentee ballot envelope against the voter's record in the statewide registration system before counting the vote;\n\nprovisional ballots voted under a law that allows people to vote the same day they register are not counted in the precinct on Election Night but instead go to the local Electoral Board to verify the voter's eligibility to vote before they can be counted andCircuit Court Clerks keep ballots for 22 months after an election.\n\nThese steps are currently required by state law and regulation.\n\nYoungkin's order also reminds voter registrars to refer to commonwealth's attorneys any non-citizen who registers to vote or who tries to.\n\n\"It's basically saying we're going to keep doing what we're already doing,\" said House Privileges and Elections Committee chair Marcia \"Cia\" Price, D-Newport News.\n\n\"I think it was more political than anything else ... if he wanted to do something about election security we could rejoin ERIC or he could have signed bills we passed than he vetoed,\" she said, referring to the multi-state Electronic Registration Information Center that exchanges data among member states about voters who move, or die, or might be registered in more than one state, to help clean up voter lists.\n\nYoungkin pulled Virginia, a founding member of ERIC, out of the group last year and vetoed bills that would have required Virginia to rejoin.\n\nHe also vetoed a measure Price sponsored that would have required specific identification information be included in any lists the state Department of Elections uses for list maintenance.\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nTimes-Dispatch reporter Anna Bryson contributed to this report.\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up!

So, the chances of other noncitizens slipping through the cracks and casting a vote there are greatly reduced.\n\nFinally, the EO compels the Virginia Department of Elections commissioner to submit an annual report to the governor certifying that all procedures have been followed regarding ballot security, counting machine testing, and a \"triple-check\" of the accuracy of all elections results.\n\nYoungkin is certainly proud of the EO and his state, claiming that Virginia has led the way in ballot security, counting machine reliability, and \"voter list maintenance.\"\n\n\"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue.

Minnesota, Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine were all at or approaching toss-up status, and Democrats were even getting worried about New Jersey and New York because of how tight the polls were getting in those states. Once Biden dropped out, things changed. Democrats received a jolt of enthusiasm and took a lot of those states off the battleground map.\n\nBut at least one of those states may still be in reach: Virginia.\n\nThough there isn't any new Trump/Harris polling out of Virginia yet, pre-Biden drop-out polling showed Harris with either an uncomfortably small lead (compared to Biden's 2020 margin) or Trump ahead. It stands to reason that she's seen a boost there over the past two weeks, but it's also likely that things will settle down back to a pre-Biden dropout dynamic eventually.\n\nWith that in mind, it's extremely comforting to see that Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-Va.) has made a significant effort to ensure election integrity in the state. This week, he signed an executive order ordering that all votes for the 2024 presidential election be cast by paper ballot.\n\n\"The Virginia model for Election Security works. This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue. Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines.

We use counting machines, not voting machines, that are tested prior to every election and never connected to the internet. We do not mass mail ballots.

Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order on Aug. 7 to implement security measures ahead of the November election.\n\nThese measures include using paper ballots; tracking possession of ballots during early voting; matching the number of ballots cast with the number of voters who have checked in and the number of ballots sent to voters; and requiring absentee ballots to be requested before being mailed to voters, in addition to not accepting them back unless the voter provides the last four digits of his or her Social Security number and birth year.\n\nVirginia uses paper ballot counting machines that are not connected to the internet. These machines are tested before elections.\n\nYoungkin also directed the state to update its voter rolls. This includes adding and removing, respectively, those who are and are not allowed to vote in the state; removing those unable to prove their residency in the commonwealth; removing the names of deceased voters from the voter rolls; and ensuring noncitizens are ineligible to cast a ballot.\n\nAccording to the executive order, almost 80,000 deceased voters have been removed from the voter rolls.\n\nIn the executive order, Youngkin instructed the Department of Motor Vehicles to \"expedite the interagency data sharing with the Department of Elections of noncitizens by generating a daily file of all noncitizens transactions, including addresses and document numbers.\"\n\nThe Department of Elections compares a list of noncitizens with those registered to vote. Those who are on both lists get removed from voter rolls. If someone is erroneously removed, they have 14 days to prove their eligibility to cast a ballot.\n\nAdditionally, Virginia has cameras monitoring drop box locations 24/7.\n\n\"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue. Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don't play games and our model for election security is working,\" said Youngkin.\n\nWhile Youngkin and the GOP flipped the gubernatorial mansion and the House of Delegates in November 2021, Democrats have controlled both houses of the state Legislature since earlier this year.\n\nThe last time a GOP presidential candidate won Virginia was in 2004 when former President George W. Bush won reelection.\n\nIn addition to the presidential race, other major races in Virginia in November include the Senate race between incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Republican Hung Cao; and key House races in the state's Second, Seventh, and 10th Congressional Districts.\n\nThe next Virginia gubernatorial election will be held in November 2025. Youngkin is ineligible to run for a second consecutive term in accordance with the state's constitution. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who is not running for reelection, is seen as the early frontrunner for the governor's mansion.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Spanberger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abigail Spanberger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia House of Delegates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Kaine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Kaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Glenn Youngkin is ordering the state Commissioner of Elections to certify that key election security measures already required by law and regulation are actually followed.\n\nA new executive order requires formal, annual certification that state and local election officials met existing state law and regulation requirements and that they complied with State Election Department guidelines.\n\n\"It really begins with the recognition that Virginia is the crucible of democracy, and therefore all Virginians who are eligible to vote, all Virginia citizens should vote,\" Youngkin told reporters Wednesday at an event to announce record state Lottery profits.\n\n\"With that, all Virginians who are voting, the citizens of Virginia, should be confident that the votes will be counted accurately, and the elections are fair, and that is at the heart of executive order,\" he said.\n\nThe order says the state elections commissioner now needs to certify to the governor that election results are triple checked.\n\nThis means, as state law and regulation now say, that officers of elections check results at the precinct level on election night, followed by checks performed by local electoral board in the days after an election and that state Department of Elections check what the local boards report though its own reviews and audits before certifying an election.\n\nYoungkin wants the commissioner to certify that the state list of registered voters is updated daily to add eligible voters and remove the names of voters who have moved, died, become ineligible because of a felony conviction or finding of mental incapacity and people who are not citizens.\n\nHe also directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine the legal status of people applying for driver's licenses, to make sure they don't apply to register as voters as part of the process of getting a license. DMV is also to speed information about non-citizen license issues to election officials.\n\nIn addition, the order says the election commissioner is to certify that:\n\nall equipment used in voting and in counting ballots, including electronic pollbooks, is tested before use;only paper ballots and paper ballot counting machines, rather than electronic voting machines, are used in Virginia elections;ballot counting machines are certified to state and federal standards and that they are not connected to the Internet and so are vulnerable to hackers;ballots are tracked through every step of voting and counting and certifying election results;there is a documented chain of custody for ballots with daily updates during early voting;absentee ballots can only be mailed when a registered voter asks for one;\n\nregistrars match the partial Social Security number and date of birth information on an absentee ballot envelope against the voter's record in the statewide registration system before counting the vote;\n\nprovisional ballots voted under a law that allows people to vote the same day they register are not counted in the precinct on Election Night but instead go to the local Electoral Board to verify the voter's eligibility to vote before they can be counted andCircuit Court Clerks keep ballots for 22 months after an election.\n\nThese steps are currently required by state law and regulation.\n\nYoungkin's order also reminds voter registrars to refer to commonwealth's attorneys any non-citizen who registers to vote or who tries to.\n\n\"It's basically saying we're going to keep doing what we're already doing,\" said House Privileges and Elections Committee chair Marcia \"Cia\" Price, D-Newport News.\n\n\"I think it was more political than anything else ... if he wanted to do something about election security we could rejoin ERIC or he could have signed bills we passed than he vetoed,\" she said, referring to the multi-state Electronic Registration Information Center that exchanges data among member states about voters who move, or die, or might be registered in more than one state, to help clean up voter lists.\n\nYoungkin pulled Virginia, a founding member of ERIC, out of the group last year and vetoed bills that would have required Virginia to rejoin.\n\nHe also vetoed a measure Price sponsored that would have required specific identification information be included in any lists the state Department of Elections uses for list maintenance.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order on Wednesday that aims to strengthen election security in the state, including the removal of noncitizens from voter rolls and establishing procedures to prosecute them.\n\nYoungkin's office issued Executive Order 35, which codifies election integrity in the state through a slate of measures, including tighter ballot security procedures, enhanced voter machine testing and voter-list maintenance that more thoroughly identifies and removes noncitizens on voter rolls. The order builds upon election integrity efforts made earlier in his administration, such as an executive order in June that updated data-sharing agreements and streamlined the removal of dead voters from the rolls. (RELATED: Illegal Migrant Deported For Rape Reentered US, Got Convicted Of Another Sex Crime)\n\n\"The Virginia model for Election Security works,\" Youngkin said Wednesday in a press release announcing the executive order. \"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue.\"\n\n\"Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don't play games and our model for election security is working,\" the governor continued.\n\nThere have been documented cases of noncitizens enrolling on voter lists, with the Virginia Attorney General on Wednesday announcing that his office has identified and removed more than 6,000 noncitizens on voter rolls since he entered office.\n\nYoungkin's order specifically targets noncitizen participation in elections by directing the Commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify in writing that individuals who were unable to verify their citizenship are to be removed from the statewide voter registration list. Before issuing a driver's license, the Department of Motor Vehicles must also verify an applicant's identity and legal status with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Social Security Administration database.\n\nThe executive order also outlines procedures for when a noncitizen attempts to register to vote, which includes notifying prosecutors when it happens and affirming that the Virginia Attorney General has the \"full authority\" to enforce the state's election laws. (RELATED: California Gave Driver's License To Illegal Migrant Arrested For Deadly Carjacking Of Grandmother)\n\n\"We verify the legal presence and identity of voters using DMV data and other trusted data sources to update our voter rolls daily, not only adding new voters, but scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and non-citizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register,\" Youngkin said of the order.\n\nThe governor's order follows growing efforts by Republicans to ensure illegal migrants and other noncitizens are not allowed to participate in federal elections, while many Democrats have argued that this is a made-up controversy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in July referred to claims of noncitizen participation in elections as \"easily disproven falsehoods\" in a public statement opposing a House GOP bill that aims to strengthen election integrity.\n\nIn a related case across the U.S., America First Legal sued Maricopa County, Arizona, on Tuesday for allegedly failing to remove noncitizens from its voter rolls, with the group claiming earlier this year that there were more than 35,000 registered voters in Arizona who have not provided proof of citizenship.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

elections;ballot counting machines are certified to state and federal standards and that they are not connected to the Internet and so are vulnerable to hackers;ballots are tracked through every step of voting and counting and certifying election results;there is a documented chain of custody for ballots with daily updates during early voting;absentee ballots can only be mailed when a registered voter asks for one;\n\nregistrars match the partial Social Security number and date of birth information on an absentee ballot envelope against the voter's record in the statewide registration system before counting the vote;\n\nprovisional ballots voted under a law that allows people to vote the same day they register are not counted in the precinct on Election Night but instead go to the local Electoral Board to verify the voter's eligibility to vote before they can be counted andCircuit Court Clerks keep ballots for 22 months after an election.\n\nThese steps are currently required by state law and regulation.\n\nYoungkin's order also reminds voter registrars to refer to commonwealth's attorneys any non-citizen who registers to vote or who tries to.\n\n\"It's basically saying we're going to keep doing what we're already doing,\" said House Privileges and Elections Committee chair Marcia \"Cia\" Price, D-Newport News.\n\n\"I think it was more political than anything else ... if

Information Center that exchanges data among member states about voters who move, or die, or might be registered in more than one state, to help clean up voter lists.\n\nYoungkin pulled Virginia, a founding member of ERIC, out of the group last year and vetoed bills that would have required Virginia to rejoin.\n\nHe also vetoed a measure Price sponsored that would have required specific

Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) executive order on election security as Republicans look to flip Virginia this November.\n\nOn Wednesday, Youngkin issued an executive order enhancing ballot security, establishing counting machine testing, and strengthening voter list maintenance. Trump heralded the measure on social media, arguing it keeps non-citizens from accessing swing-state voter rolls.\n\n\"The beautiful Commonwealth of Virginia, superbly led by Governor Glenn Youngkin, IS TAKING A STRONG LEAD IN SECURING THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER -- PROTECTING EVERY LEGAL VOTE AND KEEPING ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT HAVE BEEN LET INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM VOTING,\" Trump said in a post to Truth Social.\n\nA Republican presidential candidate hasn't won Virginia in two decades. Political strategists say that could change this year as the GOP bids to flip the Old Dominion red. Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have opened at least 30 election offices across the state, and its governor said in July it is \"in play.\"\n\nTrump has long expressed concern about security in November's election, and he prodded other states to consider voter security measures \"to make sure the Election is FAIR and SECURE.\"\n\n\"EVERY STATE SHOULD FOLLOW VIRGINIA'S LEAD,\" Trump urged as he pushed for \"volunteers to watch the polls\" this November. \"All votes will be on paper ballots and counted safely and fairly, not by machines connected to the internet -- A big security risk.\"\n\nThere was no evidence of widespread voter fraud or a lack of security in the 2020 elections.\n\nTrump and Youngkin share a complicated relationship. As the Virginia Republican was rumored to be a presidential rival against Trump, the former president lashed out at his potential rival on social media. Youngkin won his gubernatorial bid in 2022 and made his Chesapeake debut this past June.\n\nThe battleground state governor joined Trump onstage at the time, promising \"On behalf of 8.7 million Virginians, Mr. President, we are going to go to work and get you back in the White House!\"\n\nYoungkin was later rumored to be eyed by the Trump camp as a running mate material before the GOP leader settled on Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH).\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Youngkin vowed his Executive Order 35 would make sure the 2024 election in his state is safe and secure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue,\" Youngkin noted. \"Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_hallas@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Emily Hallas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dominion_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Dominion University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Glenn Youngkin's executive order requiring formal certification that election officials follow Virginia's existing election security regulations and law drew praise from former president Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, who has falsely denied that he lost the 2020 election, including his 10.1 percentage-point loss in Virginia, said in a post on his Truth Social network that Youngkin has set an example for other states.\n\nYoungkin, RNC Chair Whatley: Virginia is a battleground state in 2024\n\nHis message highlighted the state's requirement that Virginians can only vote on paper ballots, as they did in his 2020 and 2016 losses here.\n\nPeople are also reading...

People with disabilities can use \"ballot marking devices\" which generate paper ballots by offering a variety of ways they can hear or read Braille to see who is on the ballot. as well as a variety of ways they can indicate their choice if disability keeps them from using a pen or pencil.\n\nYoungkin's executive order directed the state Commissioner of Elections to produce formal, annual certifications that state and local election officials meet longstanding state law and regulation requirements on using paper ballots, counting them, verifying results and maintaining voter lists.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nHe also directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine the legal status of people applying for driver's licenses, to make sure they don't apply to register as voters as part of the process of getting a license. DMV is also to speed information about non-citizen license issues to election officials.\n\nThe chairs of the House of Delegates and state Senate Privileges and Elections committees, Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, and state Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, noted that Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the Electronic Registration Information Center. The multi-state system allows election officials to exchange information about voters who moved, died or are registered in more than one place.\n\nYoungkin this year vetoed bills that would have required Virginia to rejoin the center. He also vetoed a measure Price sponsored that would have required unique individual identifiers data on any data the state Department of Elections uses for list maintenance, to ensure that information about eligibility is linked to the right person.\n\nIn 2020, Virginia's paper ballots gave Democrat Joe Biden a margin over Trump of more than 451,000 votes, or 10.1 percentage points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton topped Trump in Virginia by more than 212,000 votes or 5.3 percentage points.\n\n\"I don't believe that we lost there. I don't believe we lost Virginia,\" Trump told broadcaster John Fredericks shortly after Youngkin's victory in the 2021 gubernatorial election, according to published reports at the time. Fredericks was Trump's Virginia campaign manager in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\"What a mess, what a mess, this election process. Now I don't believe it. They said Virginia's blue. I never believed it was blue,\" Trump told Fredericks.\n\nYoungkin has said Virginia will be a battleground state this year. Trump has said he will win Virginia this year.\n\nThrough Our Lens: Former President Trump's rally in Chesapeake on June 28\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nDave Ress\n\nGrowth and Development Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Dave Ress Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The measure was passed largely upon party lines (only five Democrats voted in favor of it) and was not expected to advance through the Senate or receive support from President Joe Biden (or whoever is calling the shots these days).\n\nWith Vote on SAVE Act, House Dems Reveal Their Stance on Noncitizen Voting\n\nAs we noted at the time:\n\nThe primary talking point of opposition to the measure appears to be, \"But that (non-citizen voting), like, hardly ever happens.\"\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, a proposal Republicans have prioritized as an election-year talking point even as research shows noncitizens illegally registering and casting ballots in federal elections is exceptionally rare.\n\nWe've seen that narrative from numerous quarters:\n\nHouse GOP passes bill targeting noncitizen voting - already illegal in federal elections - in Trump-aligned push\n\nNoncitizens Are Not Voting in Federal or State Elections -- Here's Why\n\nNoncitizen voting isn't an issue in federal elections, regardless of conspiracy theories. Here's why\n\nWhew! That's a relief, right? There's just one hitch: Thousands of non-citizens are registered to vote even though it's illegal for them to vote -- and that's just in Virginia alone.\n\nOn Wednesday, Governor Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order on election security, which, among other things, identified 6,303 non-citizens who had been identified and removed from Virginia's voting rolls between January 2022 and July 2024.\n\nThe five-page order, titled \"Comprehensive Election Security Protecting Legal Voters and Accurate Counting,\" references the SAVE Act, sets forth the importance of the initiative, and directs the Commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify annually in writing to the governor that certain election security procedures are in place as well as the accuracy of voter lists. It further directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to generate a daily file of all non-citizen transactions and refer false claims of citizenship to the local Commonwealth attorney for prosecution. Further, the order directs the Department of Elections and all state agencies that register voters to prominently post and display pertinent code sections regarding election-related offenses.\n\nNaysayers will undoubtedly argue that even if non-citizens are registered to vote (purely inadvertently, no doubt), that doesn't mean that they actually are availing themselves of the process. Here's the thing about that: While many, if not most, instances of non-citizen voter registration may be accidental rather than purposeful/deceitful, persons ineligible to vote should not be registered to vote in the first place and ensuring that they are not (or are removed from the voting rolls) will go a long way toward preventing illegal voting.\n\nAdditionally, as Youngkin's order notes, recent improvements Virginia has implemented in its systems for identifying individuals who no longer reside in the state have resulted in the state removing 79,867 deceased voters from their rolls, as well.

Glenn Youngkin revealed on Wednesday that the commonwealth's Department of Elections (ELECT) has removed more than 6,300 noncitizens from its voter rolls since his administration took office.\n\n\"All data collected by the DMV that identifies noncitizens is shared with ELECT, which uses it to scrub existing voter rolls and remove noncitizens who may have purposefully or accidentally registered to vote,\" Youngkin wrote. \"According to data from ELECT, between January 2022 and July 2024, records indicate we removed 6,303 noncitizens from the voter rolls.\"\n\nVirginia is one of only three states to require individuals \"provide their full 9-digit Social Security number\" when registering to vote, according to Youngkin.\n\nIn his order, the GOP governor instructed ELECT Commissioner Susan Beals to provide him with annual confirmation that the state's proper election protocols are \"in place\" and local registrars are fully trained on \"these critical procedures.\" This includes rules governing ballot deadlines, ballot chain of custody, tabulation machines, and verifying election results to ensure accuracy.", "source": {"uri": "johnlocke.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "John Locke Foundation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@johnlocke.org", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smear campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chain of custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.johnlocke.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glenn-youngkin.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799507", "eventUri": "eng-9799507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 460893147, "relevance": 2}

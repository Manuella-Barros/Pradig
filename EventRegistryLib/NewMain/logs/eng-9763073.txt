No one knows for sure", "body": "NASA and Boeing are preparing to announce the return plans for astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, who have been aboard the International Space Station (ISS) longer than initially planned. A media teleconference is set for 9:00pm today, \"to provide the latest update on the Boeing Crew Flight Test mission aboard the International Space Station,\" according to a NASA announcement. The astronauts were launched on June 5 aboard Starliner as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nNASA and Boeing are expected to provide further updates on the return plans for Williams and Wilmore, as well as insights on the ground hot fire testing. Mark Nappi of Boeing emphasized that in an emergency, the Starliner and its crew could return immediately. \"We want to fill in the blanks and run this test to assure ourselves of that,\" he said. The safe return of both astronauts is crucial for NASA's efforts to certify Starliner system for future missions.\n\nIn preparation for the astronauts' return, NASA and Boeing have completed ground hot fire testing of a Starliner reaction control system thruster at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico. These tests simulated different flight conditions, including potential stress scenarios during undocking and deorbit burn. The data collected is currently being analyzed. On July 10, Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program director, suggested that the earliest Williams and Wilmore could return to Earth may be by the end of July.\n\nOriginally, the Starliner mission was scheduled to last just seven days.

Five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated.\n\nIt appears degraded seals are to blame for the helium leaks and thruster problems -- entirely separate issues -- but more analysis is needed. The team will test-fire the capsule's thrusters this weekend while docked to the space station to gather more data, said Boeing's Mark Nappi.\n\nEach of the 28 maneuvering thrusters can fit in a hand and weighs 2 pounds (1 kilogram). The capsule is also outfitted with bigger engines for dropping out of orbit at flight's end. All these are part of a segment that is discarded before landing, which means nothing to study for future flights.\n\nAfter the space shuttles retired, NASA hired private companies for astronaut rides to the space station, paying Boeing and SpaceX billions of dollars.\n\nThis was the Boeing's first test flight with a crew aboard. The initial demo in 2019, flying empty, never made it to the space station because of bad software, and Boeing repeated the test in 2022. More issues later cropped up.\n\nSpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have been grounded for the past two weeks because of an upper-stage failure on a satellite-delivery mission.

It should have returned with its NASA test pilots by mid-June, but thruster failures and helium leaks prompted NASA and Boeing to extend its stay.\n\nBoeing had previously said that astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams could use the Starliner to return to Earth immediately if the situation demands it, but that's not the case. Both Wilmore and Williams said they were confident they'd return home safely despite the delay.\n\nNASA and Boeing said the capsule's batteries are performing well despite the extended stay.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we could get in our spacecraft, and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said in a press conference last week.\n\nAlthough Sunday was the end of the 45-day stay the mission was approved for, NASA and Boeing reassured the public and astronauts it was safe to stay in the capsule at the ISS past the mission's initial window.\n\nStarliner was plagued with issues before it even launched. The spacecraft's launch was scrubbed twice, including one right before liftoff. Helium leaks were also reported.\n\nBoth agencies did not indicate when the astronauts will return to Earth but are hopeful for a return in the coming weeks.

The capsule is also outfitted with bigger engines for dropping out of orbit at flight's end. All these are part of a segment that is discarded before landing, which means nothing to study for future flights.\n\nAfter the space shuttles retired, NASA hired private companies for astronaut rides to the space station, paying Boeing and SpaceX billions of dollars.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis was the Boeing's first test flight with a crew aboard. The initial demo in 2019, flying empty, never made it to the space station because of bad software, and Boeing repeated the test in 2022. More issues later cropped up.\n\nSpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have been grounded for the past two weeks because of an upper-stage failure on a satellite-delivery mission. The longer the stand-down continues, the more likely upcoming crew flights will be delayed.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Tonight, they may shed some light on the subject and indicate concrete steps and actual dates. Notably, both NASA and Boeing carried out a number of tests on the Starliner over the past few days and the results are expected to be announced too.\n\nIf the Boeing Starliner's technical issues have been fixed to the satisfaction of the engineers, the next step may well be to announce a firm return date for both astronauts. At the moment, the return date that Williams had indicated was \"before July\" while NASA engineers have indicated either before end of July or sometime before mid-August. The August deadline is expected to be before the other crewmembers on the ISS are sent back to Earth and their replacements take over.\n\nThe media teleconference by NASA and Boeing will take place at 9 pm IST (11:30 am EDT), Thursday July 25.

We'll have a lot more work to do to get there for the final return, but they're safe on the space station.\"\n\nFrom there, NASA issued a statement to say it would only be upon the completion of ground testing and associated data analysis that an agency-level review could clear the way for Starliner's return to Earth.\n\nGround hot fire testing of a Starliner reaction control system thruster has since been completed in White Sands, New Mexico, and initial findings of the relevant data analytics are said to be discussed during Thursday's teleconference, according to NASA.\n\nClickOrlando.com will stream the teleconference live at the top of this story.\n\nMore Stories Like This In Our Email Newsletter\n\nEmail AddressSign up now!\n\nGet today's headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_hogan@clickorlando.com", "name": "Brandon Hogan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/AZD5W5ZWWVCHXEVCQQP4D6UB6Q.jpg?_a=DATAdtfiZAA0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763073", "eventUri": "eng-9763073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 447, "textEnd": 453}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 983, "textEnd": 990}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1953, "textEnd": 1960}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

They then fired the thruster to try out several ways the engines might fire on the way home from space, according to Boeing.\n\nThe goal of this testing was to gain a better understanding of why the spacecraft's thrusters unexpectedly shut down, and what -- if any -- dangers are associated with turning those thrusters back on.\n\nOfficials said they were able to replicate how the thrusters in space deteriorated during flight with the ground tests. And the testing may have helped give engineers a better understanding of the issue's \"root cause\": Heat building up inside the thrusters may be causing Teflon seals to bulge, restricting the flow of propellant.\n\nThat testing has \"given us additional confidence to undock in return,\" said Mark Nappi, Boeing's Commercial Crew Program manager.\n\nStill, officials did not definitively say Thursday that the Starliner spacecraft that carried veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station would be the same vehicle that brought the astronauts back home.\n\n\"There is a lot of good reasons to complete this mission and bring Butch and Suni home on Starliner,\" Stich said after noting that NASA does have contingency options if Starliner is not approved to bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"We need to get through the process right,\" he added. \"We have another critical Starliner mission management team to review all the thruster data that we just talked about.\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm very confident we have a good vehicle to bring the crew back with,\" Nappi said.\n\nAs of Thursday, the astronauts have been in space for about 50 days. NASA has previously indicated that the Starliner can stay in space for a maximum of 90 days.\n\nAdditional Starliner testing\n\nSeparately, engineers may have made headway understanding helium leaks that hampered the first leg of Starliner's journey. But Boeing and NASA will take a close look at that issue again during additional testing of the vehicle that will continue this weekend, Stich said.\n\n\"The key attributes of the flight rationale really are that we understand the helium leaks -- we understand the stability of the leaks and how we can manage those, should they get bigger,\" Stich said.\n\nThat testing will include firing 27 of the Starliner's thrusters while the vehicle remains docked with the ISS in space.\n\nNASA and Boeing also plan to carry out a review to plan for Starliner's undocking, which \"could be as early as late next week,\" according to NASA's Commercial crew program manager, Steve Stich.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

We're making great progress, but we're just not quite ready to do that,\" he said.\n\nStich said NASA needs to first conduct a review that won't happen until the first week of August before the agency can consider a return date.\n\nIt has now been almost two months since astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams docked to the ISS on June 5 for what was supposed to be a weeklong mission to test Boeing's long-delayed Starliner spacecraft.\n\nThe troubled mission has gone through numerous technical and software-related issues, which delayed it by about four years.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to its fateful launch, Starliner experienced issues with a vibrating oxygen valve and a small but persistent helium leak. After liftoff, the crew identified several other helium leaks, as well as failures of the reaction control system thrusters.\n\nBoeing and NASA, meanwhile, have been troubleshooting copies of the malfunctioning RCS thrusters at a facility in White Sands, N.M. Stich on Thursday's call said the tests revealed a \"bit of a bulge\" in the Teflon seal, which was consistent with in-flight observations.\n\nBoeing Vice President and Commercial Crew Program Manager Mark Nappi said in the call that the Starliner service module in White Sands had been exposed to propellant for about three years, \"so it was a really good test case to go and do some leak checks on and then take that hardware apart.\n\n\"We did those leak checks. We found leaks,\" he said.\n\nNappi added the team will continue to test-fire the thrusters this weekend.\n\n\"The last several weeks have been really useful in understanding thruster and helium anomalies and how to address these problems for future flights,\" he said. \"That's been the real goal here.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether NASA had a contingency plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, Stich said the agency has considered SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, but the focus has been on returning Boeing's craft to Earth.\n\n\"Obviously the backup option is to use a different system. I would rather not go into all those details until we get to that time -- if we ever get to that time,\" Stitch said. \"We really have our team focused on, as we close in on this final flight rationale, returning Butch and Suni on Starliner.\"\n\nSpaceX, which along with Boeing is contracted under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, ran into its own issue earlier this month when its highly successful Falcon 9 rocket suffered an anomaly that resulted in the loss of a payload of 20 Starlink satellites.\n\nThe rocket had over 300 successful launches and only three failures since its debut in 2015.\n\nThe most recent failure, besides being a stain on Falcon's otherwise illustrious track record, highlighted NASA's vulnerability in having just two vendors.\n\n\"It reminds other potential customers that it's in their interest for there to be multiple providers,\" astrophysicist and satellite tracker Jonathan McDowell said in an interview with Space.com.\n\n\"Maybe they should give some launches to some of SpaceX's rivals, even if they're not the cheapest, just to maintain the alternative, if SpaceX has another downtime.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA have repeatedly insisted that Wilmore and Williams are not \"stranded\" in space and that their extended stay aboard the ISS was to gather more data about the Starliner.\n\nThe astronauts, for their part, have remained optimistic. Wilmore earlier this month said in a press conference broadcasted from the ISS that they are \"absolutely confident\" in Starliner's capability.\n\n\"I feel confident that, if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we would get in [the Starliner spacecraft] and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,\" he said.\n\nNASA and Boeing, however, haven't been able to ward off the bad publicity. The Atlantic writer Marina Koren in an article titled \"NASA Should Ditch the Spin\" said NASA bears responsibility \"for its uneven supervision of Starliner's development leading up to launch and its overly guarded communications to the public since, which have done more to fan rumors about the state of the mission than dispel them.\"\n\nBoeing already is under intense scrutiny for abandoning safety and quality control protocols after a fuselage blowout on an Alaskan Airlines jet in January.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"},

officials.\n\n\"We're making great progress, but we're just not quite ready to do that,\" Stich added.\n\nMORE: Boeing's Starliner launches its 1st astronaut-crewed flight after several delays\n\nWhat was initially planned to be an eight-day mission, has now spanned over 50 days, with veteran NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams' return to Earth delayed until at least August, according to officials.\n\nThruster failures that caused issues on the launch trip to ISS and helium leaks on the Starliner capsule have led to continued delays, according to Boeing.\n\nThe Aerospace giant has been testing the capsule's propulsion system in White Sands, New Mexico, to identify the cause of the issues, according to Stich, who said analysis of the findings will be done this weekend.\n\nIn order to get the go-ahead for a return mission, NASA must review Boeing's engineering, which may not happen until the first week of August, Stich said.\n\nMORE: Boeing's Starliner has 5 'small' helium leaks as astronauts' ISS mission is extended: NASA\n\nOn June 11, Boeing officials said the capsule was experiencing five \"small\" helium leaks as its first astronaut-crewed flight test continued.\n\nHelium is used to pressurize the spacecraft's reaction control system (RCS) maneuvering thrusters, allowing them to fire, according to Boeing.\n\n\"Our focus today is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,\" Stich said of the astronauts. \"I think we're starting to close in on those final pieces of the flight rationale to make sure we can come home safely and that's our primary focus right now.\"\n\nMark Nappi, vice president and program manager of the commercial crew program at Boeing, was asked if there were any regrets about the mission.\n\n\"I think the only thing we'd do differently, is we would not have been so empathic about an eight-day mission,\" Nappi said of the repeated delays. \"We kept saying 'eight-day minimum mission,' I think we all knew it was going to go longer than that, it's my regret that we didn't just say 'we're gonna stay up there until we get everything done we want to go do.'\"\n\nABC News' Gina Sunseri

They then fired the thruster to try out several ways the engines might fire on the way home from space, according to Boeing.\n\nThe goal of this testing was to gain a better understanding of why the spacecraft's thrusters unexpectedly shut down, and what -- if any -- dangers are associated with turning those thrusters back on.\n\nOfficials said they were able to recreate how the thrusters in space deteriorated during flight with the ground tests. And the testing may have helped give engineers a better understanding of the issue's \"root cause\": Heat building up inside the thrusters may be causing Teflon seals to bulge, restricting the flow of propellant.\n\nThat testing has \"given us additional confidence to undock in return,\" Nappi said.\n\nThe findings also prompted Boeing and NASA to abandon plans to allow the astronauts to manually fly the Starliner spacecraft on the way home, as they did briefly during the trip to the ISS. \"Some of the manual maneuvering put some extra stress on the thrusters,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial crew program manager.\n\nStill, officials did not definitively say Thursday that the Starliner spacecraft that carried veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station would be the same vehicle that brought the astronauts back home.\n\n\"There is a lot of good reasons to complete this mission and bring Butch and Suni home on Starliner,\" Stich said after noting that NASA does have contingency options if Starliner is not approved to bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"We need to get through the process,\" he added. \"We have another critical Starliner mission management team to review all the thruster data that we just talked about.\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm very confident we have a good vehicle to bring the crew back with,\" Nappi said.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore arrived at the International Space Station on June 6 for what was expected to be a roughly week-long mission. As of Thursday, the astronauts have been in space for about 50 days. NASA has previously indicated that the Starliner can stay in space for a maximum of 90 days.\n\nSeparately, engineers may have made headway understanding helium leaks that hampered the first leg of Starliner's journey. But Boeing and NASA will take a close look at that issue again during additional testing of the vehicle in space that will continue this weekend, Stich said.\n\nThat testing will include firing 27 of the Starliner's thrusters while the vehicle remains docked with the ISS.\n\nAnalysis of components on the ground -- specifically, a version of the Starliner's service module that's been sitting in White Sands, New Mexico for three years -- showed that the helium leaks may be a result of seals that have become degraded because of exposure to propellant vapor, according to Nappi.\n\n\"The natural fix to that is to just change that seal out to a material that's not so susceptible\" to being worn down by exposure to the propellant, Nappi said, referring to possible changes Boeing can make for future Starliner missions.\n\nStill ahead, however, is work to determine whether the leaks on board the Starliner that's already in space have grown worse as the vehicle has remained docked at the ISS. Because the service module -- the portion of the spacecraft plagued by the helium leaks -- on the ground was exposed to propellant for so long, Nappi said it could offer a worst case understanding of how badly the seals can be degraded.\n\nThe ongoing effort to understand the helium leak issue is among the chief reasons why NASA and Boeing still aren't able to set a return date for Williams and Wilmore -- or give a definitive answer on whether the Starliner is ready to fly them home.\n\n\"The key attributes of the flight rationale really are that we understand the helium leaks -- we understand the stability of the leaks and how we can manage those, should they get bigger,\" Stich said, referring to the possibility that helium leaks affecting the Starliner service module may worsen.\n\nNASA and Boeing plan to carry out a review to plan for Starliner's undocking, which \"could be as early as late next week,\" according to Stich.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

However, failures with thrusters and helium leaks in Boeing's new Starliner capsule have led NASA and Boeing to extend their mission.\n\nNASA's commercial crew program manager, Steve Stich, stated that mission managers are not yet prepared to set a return date. He emphasized that the objective remains to bring Wilmore and Williams back aboard the Starliner.\n\n\"We'll come home when we're ready,\" Stich said.\n\nStich acknowledged that alternative options are being considered, including the use of SpaceX's Dragon capsule as another method for transporting NASA astronauts to and from the space station.\n\n\"NASA always has contingency options,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Sunita Williams Stranded In Space: NASA To Reveal Crucial Update On Safe Return\n\nEngineers completed testing on a spare thruster in the New Mexico desert last week and will dismantle it to investigate the issues before the Starliner's docking. During the capsule's approach to the space station on June 6, five thrusters failed just a day after launch. Since then, four of these thrusters have been reactivated.\n\nIt appears that degraded seals are responsible for the helium leaks and thruster issues, though these are distinct problems and further analysis is needed. Boeing's Mark Nappi stated that the team plans to test-fire the capsule's thrusters this weekend while it remains docked to the space station to collect additional data.\n\nEach of the 28 maneuvering thrusters, which are about the size of a hand and weigh 2 pounds (1 kilogram) each, are crucial for fine-tuning the capsule's movements. The spacecraft is also equipped with larger engines for deorbiting at the end of its mission. However, this engine segment is discarded before landing, leaving no parts for post-flight analysis.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the space shuttles, NASA contracted private companies for astronaut transportation to the space station, investing billions of dollars in Boeing and SpaceX for these services.\n\nThis was Boeing's first crewed test flight. The initial demonstration in 2019, which was conducted with an empty capsule, failed to reach the space station due to software issues.

Boeing-build ride home is full of leaks will have to spend at least a few more weeks aboard the International Space Station, officials said Thursday.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were meant to spend just eight days in space following their launch aboard to Boeing Starliner -- the maiden crewed voyage for the spacecraft.\n\nOnce in space, astronauts found a series of concerning helium leaks and have been testing whether the ship can be used to return them to Earth.\n\nNow, they're expected to stay in orbit until sometime in August, Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, told reporters.\n\nBefore the astronauts can come home, NASA and Boeing experts said they need to complete a final set of tests for Starliner's thrusters scheduled for this weekend.\n\nShould the thruster tests prove successful and the helium leaks continue to remain stable, then NASA would schedule an agency review next week, which would then set an official date for Wilmore and Williams' return.\n\n\"The prime intent is still to return Butch and Suni aboard Starliner,\" Stich added.\n\nMark Nappi, the manager of Boeing Starliner program, said that the company ultimately regrets announcing that Wilmore and Williams' mission would eight days, as the delays have garnered backlash against the troubled aerospace giant.\n\n\"My regret is that we didn't say we would stay up there until the mission is complete, but I'm very confident we have a good vehicle to bring the crew back,\" Nappi said.\n\nNASA noted that should anything go wrong with the weekend tests and Starliner proves too big of a risk for a return trip, then the agency has other backup methods to getting the astronauts home.\n\nThe easiest method, Stich said, was for Willmore and Suni to hitch a ride on SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship.\n\nThe Boeing rival, which recently ferried four astronauts to the ISS in March, is capable of carrying two to four passengers at a time, but it can fit additional occupants if needed.\n\n\"The beauty of having Dragon and Starliner is that we have two different systems of transportation to the ISS,\" Stich said. \"Someday Starliner could be a backup to a Dragon mission.\"\n\nSpaceX has served as the sole commercial company approved to transport astronauts and cargo to the space station since 2020.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

They then fired the thruster to try out several ways the engines might fire on the way home from space, according to Boeing.\n\nThe goal of this testing was to gain a better understanding of why the spacecraft's thrusters unexpectedly shut down, and what -- if any -- dangers are associated with turning those thrusters back on.\n\nOfficials said they were able to replicate how the thrusters in space deteriorated during flight with the ground tests. And the testing may have helped give engineers a better understanding of the issue's \"root cause\": Heat building up inside the thrusters may be causing Teflon seals to bulge, restricting the flow of propellant.\n\nThat testing has \"given us additional confidence to undock in return,\" said Mark Nappi, Boeing's Commercial Crew Program manager.\n\nStill, officials did not definitively say Thursday that the Starliner spacecraft that carried veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station would be the same vehicle that brought the astronauts back home.\n\n\"There is a lot of good reasons to complete this mission and bring Butch and Suni home on Starliner,\" Stich said after noting that NASA does have contingency options if Starliner is not approved to bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"We need to get through the process right,\" he added. \"We have another critical Starliner mission management team to review all the thruster data that we just talked about.\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm very confident we have a good vehicle to bring the crew back with,\" Nappi said.\n\nAs of Thursday, the astronauts have been in space for about 50 days. NASA has previously indicated that the Starliner can stay in space for a maximum of 90 days.\n\nSeparately, engineers may have made headway understanding helium leaks that hampered the first leg of Starliner's journey. But Boeing and NASA will take a close look at that issue again during additional testing of the vehicle that will continue this weekend, Stich said.\n\n\"The key attributes of the flight rationale really are that we understand the helium leaks -- we understand the stability of the leaks and how we can manage those, should they get bigger,\" Stich said.\n\nThat testing will include firing 27 of the Starliner's thrusters while the vehicle remains docked with the ISS in space.\n\nNASA and Boeing also plan to carry out a review to plan for Starliner's undocking, which \"could be as early as late next week,\" according to NASA's Commercial crew program manager, Steve Stich.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

No date has been given yet for a flight to Earth.\n\nThe two astronauts who took Boeing's buggy Starliner space capsule into space in early June still do not know when they will be returning home, a NASA official said in a press conference Thursday.\n\nStarliner launched June 5 with astronauts Sunita \"Suni\" Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore aboard. Originally, Williams and Wilmore were expected to fly to the International Space Station (ISS) and stay for roughly a week before taking the capsule back to Earth. However, after Starliner's 27-hour orbital flight to the ISS, NASA reported the craft had thruster issues and helium leaks.\n\nOn Thursday, seven weeks after Starliner's arrival at the ISS, NASA commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said they aren't ready to announce a return date for the astronauts.\n\n\"We're making great progress, but we're just not ready to do that,\" said Stich about announcing a return date for Williams and Wilmore.\n\nNASA officials have been replicating the capsule's thruster issues at its White Sands Test Facility. Stich recapped the testing, saying that degraded seals are likely to blame for the thruster and leak problems, but more probing is needed. Stich said that officials hope this weekend to execute a hot-fire test on the Starliner, while it's docked at the ISS. This test will show NASA whether the thrusters can operate correctly on a potential return trip.\n\nStich also said that his team has been given permission to double the battery waiver on the Starliner, meaning it now can have enough charge to stay docked at the ISS for 90 days, as opposed to 45 days. Stich said with this battery adjustment, the Starliner could potentially stay in space through early September. Their goal is to have Williams and Wilmore return to Earth via Starliner.\n\n\"We would not have been so emphatic about an eight-day mission,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's commercial crew program. \"It's my regret that we didn't say, 'We're just going to stay up there until we get everything done that we want to go do.'\"\n\nStich added that Williams and Wilmore, who have been hanging out at the ISS with fellow astronauts from SpaceX's Crew-8 and Russia's Soyuz MS-25, have been \"in really good spirits and having a good time\" up there.\n\nStarliner's launch was delayed multiple times. Williams and Wilmore were first expected to head to space on the capsule on May 6, but pre-flight checks revealed a valve issue. Then on May 18, the helium leak was first discovered on Starliner, pushing the launch to June 1. It was aborted once more because of \"faulty ground equipment.\"\n\nAfter Starliner docked at the ISS, its return to Earth had also been delayed multiple times, raising greater concerns about the safety of the astronauts on a potential return home. During a June 28 press conference, Nappi said press coverage of Starliner has been \"painful to read.\"\n\n\"We're not stuck on the ISS,\" Nappi said on June 28. \"The crew is not in any danger. And there's no increased risk when we decided to bring [Williams] and [Wilmore] back to Earth.\"", "source": {"uri": "chron.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chron"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Test Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz MS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Education", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/02/50/25438732/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763073", "eventUri": "eng-9763073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 313}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-06", "textStart": 2460, "textEnd": 2465}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-18", "textStart": 2521, "textEnd": 2527}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2602, "textEnd": 2608}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 2864, "textEnd": 2871, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He emphasized, \"We'll come home when we're ready,\" stating that the objective remains to bring Wilmore and Williams back aboard Starliner. Stich also mentioned that alternative plans are being reviewed, reported AP.\n\nEngineers in New Mexico recently completed tests on a spare thruster to understand the issues that occurred during docking. On June 6, a day after liftoff, five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station. Four thrusters have since been reactivated.\n\nDegraded seals appear to be the cause of the helium leaks and thruster issues, but further analysis is required. Boeing's Mark Nappi said the team plans to test-fire the thrusters this week while the capsule is docked at the space station to gather more data.\n\nFollowing the retirement of space shuttles, Nasa hired private companies for astronaut transports to the space station, awarding contracts worth billions of dollars to Boeing and SpaceX.

It is currently docked at the International Space Station.\n\nWhat was supposed to be about a week-long mission has now lasted around 50 days. Aboard the spacecraft is native East Tennessean Butch Wilmore, alongside fellow astronaut Suni Williams.\n\nNASA and Boeing held a press conference Thursday to give an update about the astronaut's return.\n\nWhile no specific return date is in sight, NASA hopes to have them home in mid-August, said Steve Stich, Program Manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Hopefully, Wilmore and Williams can return on the Starliner, rather than another spacecraft, Stich said.\n\n\"[We have] been working for a number of weeks to return Butch and Suni on the Starliner. I think we're starting to close in on those final pieces of the flight rationale,\" he said. \"We have contingency options. NASA always has contingency options.\"\n\nHelium leaks and thruster failures seem to cause the delay, Stich said in the press conference.

They were scheduled to stay a week in orbit.\n\nBut during the flight the spacecraft suffered a series of issues, including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters, forcing engineers to troubleshoot issues on the ground. This extended the two astronauts' stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to the current 50 days.\n\nYet NASA and Boeing say that even though ground tests have been completed, there is still no clear date for a flight home.\n\n\"We don't have a major announcement today relative to a return date,\" Steve Stich, the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference on Thursday (July 25). \"We're making great progress, but we're just not quite ready to do that.\"\n\nWhen the astronauts will return remains unclear, but NASA officials have said that the spacecraft has enough fuel to remain in orbit until mid-August at the latest.\n\nStitch said that NASA and Boeing may perform a test fire of the spacecraft \"as early as next week.\" Following this review, Stitch added, an undock time will be set.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRelated: Fixing Boeing's leaky Starliner -- and returning NASA's stranded astronauts to Earth -- is much harder than it sounds\n\nStarliner was built as a part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, a partnership between the agency and private companies to take astronauts into low Earth orbit following the retirement of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. SpaceX's Crew Dragon also came from this initiative and has tallied 13 crewed flights since it began operating in 2020.\n\nBut Starliner's journey into orbit has been much more troubled. A software glitch on its first uncrewed test flight pushed Starliner onto the wrong orbit, and a second attempt was scrubbed due to a faulty fuel valve. Other issues, including problems with parachutes and the need to remove nearly a mile (1.6 kilometers) of flammable tape, also subsequently cropped up.\n\nThe current, third crewed flight attempt was briefly delayed by issues with a vibrating oxygen valve and a small but persistent helium leak. Engineers ultimately deemed the craft safe to fly despite those issues. After liftoff, the leaks multiplied and several thrusters conked out, delaying the craft's docking with the ISS's Harmony module and then postponing its return to Earth.\n\nNASA officials say the spacecraft is still safe, and that the return has been delayed this long so that scientists can collect as much data as possible on the malfunctioning RCS thrusters before they are jettisoned and burn up upon reentry.\n\n\"The last several weeks have been really useful in understanding thruster and helium anomalies and how to address these problems for future flights,\" Mark Nappi, Boeing vice president and the manager of the company's commercial crew program, said at the news conference. \"That's been the real goal here.\"\n\nTo better understand how these thrusters -- which are essential for tilting the craft at the right angle to enter Earth's atmosphere -- might behave, engineers at Starliner's facility in White Sands, New Mexico, have been disassembling copies of them, inspecting them part by part for potential faults, and firing them to collect data.\n\nDuring their extended time aboard the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have performed a number of maintenance tasks and scientific projects. Once a week, they have returned to the Starliner capsule to work through the thruster issues with engineers at ground control.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n-- NASA set to launch 2 rockets into the northern lights\n\n-- China discovers strange glass beads on moon that may contain billions of tons of water\n\n-- NASA offers SpaceX $843 million to destroy the International Space Station\n\nThe astronauts' stay has been largely safe but not entirely without incident. On June 27, a defunct Russian satellite broke apart in orbit, sending debris toward the ISS and forcing Williams and Wilmore, along with the other seven astronauts on board, to take cover inside their respective space capsules.\n\nSpeaking at a July 10 news conference beamed from the ISS, Wilmore and Williams told reporters that they were confident Starliner could return them to Earth safely.\n\nWhen asked about backup plans to return the astronauts without Starliner, Stitch said that contingency plans involving SpaceX's Crew Dragon were in place, but their focus was on using Boeing's craft.\n\n\"Obviously the backup plan is to use a different system. I would rather not go into all those details until we get to that time -- if we ever get to that time,\" Stitch said. \"We really have our team focused on, as we close in on this final flight rationale, returning Butch and Suni on Starliner.\"", "source": {"uri": "livescience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "livescience.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_turner@livescience.com", "name":

But NASA and Boeing were confident enough to go ahead with the test flight last month, even as a helium leak was discovered in capsule's service module.\n\nBoeing teams determined that the helium leak was small and contained and proceeded with launch operations.\n\nAs the hours leading to docking with the ISS approached, additional helium leaks in the service module were detected. As the crew prepared for approach towards the ISS, multiple thrusters shut off, forcing teams on the ground to do what is called a \"hot fire\". As the crew manually piloted Starliner, all but one of the thrusters fired back up - allowing the crew to safely dock to the ISS.\n\nDuring a press conference Thursday, Stich and Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing Commercial Crew Program, both emphasized confidence that Starliner can safely bring the crew home.\n\nThe Starliner service module will be jettisoned and disintegrate during re-entry, so engineers on the ground are conducting tests at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico to try to understand what caused the helium leaks and thruster problems.\n\nIn the coming days, there will be a \"hot dock\" fire test where Starliner's thrusters will be fired while still docked to the space station - ensuring they fire correctly before moving towards undocking.\n\nThe helium leak rates will also be reassessed, as it has been six weeks since the latest evaluation of the issue. This was not an issue, as while docked, the helium is not needed and closed off.\n\nNappi told reporters that teams are learning a lot from this flight, and he only wished they had used different terminology when describing the mission objectives. While it was stated to be a minimum of eight days, there was a high possibility the mission could run longer - in this case, close to two months over. \"We all knew it was going to go longer than that,\" said Nappi.\n\nFor the latest from the Space Coast, be sure to follow the FLORIDA TODAY Space Team at floridatoday.com/space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

They're flying on the Crew Flight Test mission, the first human spaceflight for Starliner as part of Boeing's efforts to play catchup and join SpaceX to provide rides to and from the ISS from the U.S.\n\nWhile it was originally targeting an eight-day stay on board the ISS, the duo have now been on the station more than 50 days as Boeing and NASA work through issues found during the flight up with both helium leaks and failed thrusters on Starliner's propulsion system. The earliest Starliner could leave the ISS would likely be mid-September.\n\n\"We kept saying eight-day minimum mission,\" said Boeing's Mark Nappi, vice president of the company's commercial crew program. \"I think we all knew that it was going to go longer than that. We didn't spend a lot of time talking about how much longer but I think it's my regret that we didn't just say we're going to stay up there until we get everything done that we want to go do.\"\n\nThat to-do list has meant making sure teams understand why five thrusters failed as Starliner approached the ISS as well as figure out the reason behind several small helium leaks in the spacecraft's service module. While docked, the helium leaks have been locked down, and NASA and Boeing were able to refire four of the five thrusters back into working condition, although at lower than optimum power levels.\n\nWhile teams had already signed off on Williams and Wilmore being able to use Starliner in the case of emergency, the decision was made to go through a series of tests on the ground at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, which were completed last week.\n\nAt issue is the service module will be jettisoned before Starliner's reentry so Boeing and NASA won't get their hands on the hardware to look closer at why it suffered the failures that it did. The ground testing and delay in return for Starliner is designed to help remedy any problems for the six contracted future flights for Starliner to the ISS.\n\nThe good news is the teams think they have the likely source of the thruster issue after running through an intensive set of tests replicating both the stresses and heat conditions the spacecraft endured on the flight up, as well as what teams expect for the flight home. The thrusters will be needed for the deorbit burn.\n\nTeams were also able to find a likely source of the helium leaks by looking at a Starliner service module that had been set aside from 2021, and found \"degradation\" in seals that were exposed to nitrous oxide vapor over the last three years, something similar to what the CFT service module would have experienced at lower levels during the three months leading up to its launch.\n\nThe solutions for future launches may be require changes in seal material and even adjusting how Starliner flies and how often it uses its thrusters to limit heat buildup.\n\n\"We looked at the data. It really does replicate well what we're seeing in flight,\" Nappi said. \"So we think these findings are very significant and are likely the root cause. Obviously, knowing root cause is what gets us to permanent fixes. So there's very strong evidence, and we're going to continue to take that hardware apart so that we can finally prove this.\"\n\nWhat's next for Starliner is another hot fire test on board the ISS this weekend while Boeing finishes up its report from the White Sands testing.\n\n\"We'll work to execute an agency review as soon as we're ready to do that. That could be as early as late next week,\" Stich said. \"We are following the data, and we'll schedule that review when we need to. And then after that we'll set the the undock time.\"\n\nStich said the decision to come home can be made after teams understood why the helium was leaking and knowing the leaks could be controlled for a safe flight home.\n\n\"We understand the stability of the leaks and how we can manage those should they get bigger,\" he said. \"We have a criteria in place that we have established a leak rate that we'll check before undock and verify that system is good to go.\"\n\nAnd then it's confirming the thrusters will be where they need to be for the flight home.\n\n\"The hot fire test this weekend will give us confidence in all the thrusters,\" he said. \"That's really I think the final pieces of the flight rationale that we need to put together. .... and we'll come home when we're ready.\"",

The spacecraft, intended to ferry astronauts between Earth and the International Space Station (ISS), is currently performing its first crewed test flight, but what was supposed to be a one-week test has turned into a multiweek debacle.\n\nThough the two astronauts who traveled on the Starliner, NASA's Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are in no danger, they have been stuck on the ISS for seven weeks now. NASA insists that they are not stranded and that they could use the Starliner to travel back to Earth in the case of an emergency, but concerns about the performance of the Starliner mean they still have no planned return date.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIn a press conference today, July 25, NASA shared details about the testing being performed on the Starliner's thrusters, some of which malfunctioned during the ISS docking process seven weeks ago.\n\nAt the NASA facility in White Sands in New Mexico, engineers are testing a thruster from a Starliner that had been intended for use on a future mission to try to recreate the conditions that caused the original thrusters to fail. The problem seems to stem from the pulse rate -- that is, how frequently it was fired successively in a short time (rather than how hard it was fired or how many pulses overall) A similar problem of loss of thrust was seen in the tester thruster as well.\n\n\"Right now we're in the middle of the teardown of the thruster,\" said Steve Stich, NASA Commercial Crew Program manager. \"So, we have the thruster at the White Sands test facility, it's in the lab, it's been disassembled. And we're looking very carefully at the fuel valve and the oxidizer valve.\" These two valves control the flow of propellant into the thruster, and one of them is showing a bulge in a seal, which could be responsible for the issues.\n\nThe important issue is whether the seal, and therefore the thruster, could survive the return flight to Earth. Current testing suggests that it can, but NASA was set to perform more testing to check this. The next major piece of testing is a hot fire test, in which 27 of the Starliner's thrusters will be fired while in orbit to check if any failures occur. That test is scheduled for this weekend.\n\nIn addition to the thruster issue, the spacecraft was also leaking helium on its journey to the station. Since it has been docked, the manifolds have been closed so the system doesn't leak, but now each manifold will be pressurized to test whether the leaks reoccur.\n\nAnother concern was the Starliner's batteries, which were originally only cleared for 45 days in space. The Starliner has now passed that limit, but the safe life of the batteries has been extended to 90 days.\n\nWhile testing of any spacecraft will often turn up issues, and Williams and Wilmore have been positive about their experiences with the Starliner, the ongoing issues with the Starliner and the lack of quick resolution is starting to wear on the patience of the space community, with questions raised about whether NASA's communications during this time have been sufficient.\n\n\"There's been a ton of learning over the last couple of months while we've been docked that really is preparing us for increment operations,\" said Stich. There is still no date set for the return, however.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgina_torbet@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Georgina Torbet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxidizing agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabin pressurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/boeing-starliner-at-ISS.jpeg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763073", "eventUri": "eng-9763073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 726, "textEnd": 733}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

(Image credit: NASA)\n\nBoeing's Starliner will do a \"hot fire\" test in orbit soon, as NASA and the company continue to probe the cause of thruster failures and a helium leak in space.\n\nStarliner will conduct the test-fire of its 28-thruster reaction control system (RCS) on either Saturday (July 27) or Sunday (July 28) at the International Space Station (ISS), NASA and Boeing announced in a press conference today (July 25). Only 27 of the RCS thrusters will be used, however, as one previously was deemed unusable for the flight home.\n\nCommands will be done from the ground, although NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams -- the astronauts flying on Starliner's current mission, known as Crew Flight Test (CFT) -- will likely join, due to their interest as former U.S. Navy test test pilots.\n\n\"We're going to fire all those thrusters to a number of pulses, just to make sure before we undock, that whole system performs the way we expected and the way it did last time we checked it,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, told reporters in a livestreamed press conference.\n\n\"We'll also get a chance to look at the helium system,\" he added. \"It's been six weeks since we last checked that helium system; that was on June 15. So we'll pressurize manifold by manifold, and then hot-fire the thrusters, and then we'll get a chance to look at the helium leak rates and verify that the system is stable.\"\n\nCFT had been initially manifested to last about 10 days after launching on June 5, but faced thruster problems and helium leaks before safely docking with the ISS the next day. So the mission has been indefinitely extended while engineers troubleshoot the problem.\n\nRelated: When will Starliner come home? Boeing and NASA still don't know\n\nFollowing ground tests at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico in early July, engineers now have more insight as to what happened during the difficult docking.\n\nFor example, an Aerojet Rocketdyne test MR-104J test thruster similar to those aboard Starliner, which had been in storage for three years prior to the recent ground work, experienced \"severe degradation\" in its valve system from nitrous oxide vapor; propellant flow was restricted due to bulging in a seal, Stich said. Engineers also found Teflon stuck in a downstream filter, suggesting erosion in a seal due to \"bubbling\" under high temperature.\n\nThe behavior of Starliner RCS thrusters in orbit seems to match what is being observed on the ground, Stich noted. The thruster type, he told Space.com during the press conference, \"has heritage\" from other spaceflight programs at Aerojet (an L3Harris company), but was modified for Starliner's service module, where the RCS thrusters and propulsion system are housed.\n\n\"I think what we are now starting to understand much better on this mission -- and we would not have understood this by just staying on the ground and doing more analysis and test -- is we understand the integrated effects between how the guidance, navigation and control system [and] the flight control system during rendezvous is commanding the thrusters to fire,\" Stich said.\n\nA surrounding \"doghouse\" around each RCS thruster group insulates and protects the thrusters from the cold temperatures of space. (There are four doghouses on the service module in total.) What CFT has shown is that a number of RCS thruster pulses in a short time, on top of firings with the orbital maneuvering and attitude control system (OMAC), causes RCS thruster temperatures to increase more than expected.\n\nRelated: 'I'm sure we'll find things out': NASA astronauts fly to launch site for 1st crewed Boeing Starliner mission to ISS (photos)\n\nStich said that it's possible the problem could be addressed not by a design change, but by changing the ways in which the thrusters are used in flight (such as firing them less frequently). Discussions are ongoing at the most senior agency levels, he emphasized; NASA plans an agency-level review on CFT as early as next week, and the agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel will also be invited to it, he said.\n\nAerojet Rocketdyne has been working closely with Boeing throughout the mission, added Boeing Commercial Crew Program Manager Mark Nappi. Discussions are ongoing as to how to address the issue. New seals might be put in, for example. For the thrusters, Boeing may ask future crews to fly a different profile to the ISS or \"put different thermal protection inside the doghouse,\" Nappi said today.\n\nTest missions like CFT commonly face the unexpected, and Starliner was always rated to leave the ISS in case of emergency. CFT astronauts Wilmore and Williams participated in orbital troubleshooting in June before being retasked to ISS maintenance duties for what has now been a 50-day mission (and counting).\n\nNASA also extended CFT's initial limit in space past 45 days, saying the battery performance (which initially informed the limit) was doing better than expected in orbit. In today's briefing, Stich said the mission has now been officially rated for 90 days, or to Sept. 3 (although landing timing has not yet been firmed up.)\n\nUnderstanding the root causes of the thruster and helium issues in the RCS, which controls maneuvers in orbit, is important for future Starliner missions. Following CFT, the Starliner-1 mission with at least three astronauts is supposed to spend six months on the ISS no earlier than 2025.\n\nStarliner is one of two private U.S. spacecraft that sends astronauts to the ISS, along with SpaceX's Crew Dragon. Crew Dragon, flying crews since May 2020, is based upon SpaceX's cargo Dragon that has been to space repeatedly since 2012. Starliner, as a new spacecraft, faced development challenges after its first spaceflight.\n\nStarliner's initial ISS launch without astronauts, in December 2019, never reached its destination due to computer problems that kept the spacecraft in the wrong orbit. The follow-up uncrewed mission reached its destination, but that took place in May 2022, after the COVID-19 pandemic erupted and dozens of fixes were implemented. (The 2022 docking also had thruster issues, which NASA thought it had addressed for CFT.)\n\nCFT was delayed in 2023 after flammable tape was found in Starliner's wiring, and engineers discovered the parachutes could carry less load than expected. For months, the mission appeared on track for a May 6 launch date. But hours before liftoff, the astronauts were pulled out of the spacecraft after a vibrating valve was discovered in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket.\n\nRelated: 'It's so complicated:' Boeing Starliner teams diagnosing helium leak ahead of astronaut launch\n\nStarliner stayed grounded for a month as ULA replaced the valve, and after a tiny helium leak was discovered in one RCS thruster. Extensive testing and modeling on the ground found no anticipated problems for CFT, but the analysis uncovered a vulnerability: Under certain circumstances, if enough RCS thrusters failed in adjacent doghouses, one reentry option could be affected. Following engineering and simulator work, NASA and Boeing certified a new reentry mode requiring fewer RCS thrusters to fire at a time.\n\nCFT launched on June 5, but only after facing down another late-countdown scrub due to a ground equipment fault affecting Atlas V. Aside from experiencing issues with the docking, NASA and Boeing have emphasized that Starliner's stay in space has been uneventful and the spacecraft is performing well. And as former U.S. Navy test pilots, both Williams and Wilmore are used to long deployments and developmental programs.\n\nStarliner and SpaceX each received billions of dollars to carry astronauts under a contract with NASA's Commercial Crew Program in 2014. Following a test astronaut flight that launched in May 2020, SpaceX has now sent 11 crews to the ISS: eight on behalf of NASA, and three shorter-term ones for Axiom Space.\n\nSpaceX missions are grounded for the time being due to a problem with the second stage of the Falcon 9 rocket encountered during a Starlink satellite launch earlier this month. The Falcon 9 completed a static fire last night, but the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet responded to SpaceX's request to refly missions under a public safety determination; SpaceX argues that no risk was posed to the public during the launch, as only the rocket's second stage (in space) was affected.\n\nFor now, SpaceX is expected to launch two ISS missions in August, pending FAA approval and NASA's independent review: Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo spacecraft, and Crew-9's four astronauts aboard Crew Dragon.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Of course, I'm very confident we have a good vehicle to bring the crew back with.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the stranded Williams and Wilmore are keeping themselves busy supporting the Expedition 71 crew with space station research and maintenance.\n\nBoth astronauts took part in vein scans using an ultrasound device on Monday, July 15, to help researchers understand how microgravity affects the human body, according to a mission update.\n\nThey took turns imaging each other's neck, shoulder, and leg veins while doctors on the ground monitored in real-time. The pair also spent time taking inventory of the food stored on the space station.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore launched into orbit on Wednesday, June 5, for what was supposed to be a week-long expedition for Starliner. It was the first time a woman had been aboard a maiden flight of a crewed spacecraft.\n\nThe journey marks its last test before the craft goes into regular service in 2025 as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, aimed at providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to the space station. SpaceX began providing service in 2020.\n\nNASA previously said that Starliner has enough fuel to remain in orbit until mid-August.\n\nA 1983 graduate of Needham High School, Williams became an astronaut in August 1998 after more than a decade as a helicopter pilot in the US Navy. She made her first trip to the International Space Station aboard Space Shuttle Discovery in December 2006.\n\nThroughout her career, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in 30 different aircraft. In 2019, her hometown of Needham honored her by naming its new elementary school Sunita L.

They'll discuss different options to accommodate, or avoid altogether, tying the record for most people to ever live on the space station at once.\n\nAccording to a NASA press briefing on Thursday morning, the Boeing Starliner spacecraft won't be leaving its parking spot at the ISS anytime soon. When reporters asked for an estimate of the next possible return date for Starliner -- which carried astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to space on June 5 for what was supposed to be an 8-day flight -- Stich hesitated to provide one.\n\n\"Boy, I'd hate to pick a date,\" Stich told reporters.\n\nThe ISS is scheduled to receive four more astronauts in mid-August, when NASA astronauts Zena Cardman, Nick Hague, Stephanie Wilson and Russian cosmonaut Alexsandr Gorbunov are set to reach the station via a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft for the Crew-9 mission.\n\nWilmore and Williams have already outstretched their initial mission timeline by seven weeks, and counting -- and may not come home until the middle or end of August, right when Crew-9 is meant to arrive.\n\nIn addition to Williams and Wilmore, there are seven other people currently at the station; the seven are known collectively as ISS Expedition 71. They include Crew-8, which launched in March. It's four passengers -- NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin -- aren't scheduled to leave the ISS until the fall. (Typically, Dragon Crews overlap on the space station by a few days. Crew-8, for instance, reached the ISS six days before Crew-7 undocked.) The rest of Expedition 71 includes the passengers of the Russian Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft. It won't bring home NASA astronaut Tracy Dyson and Russian cosmonauts Nikolai Chub and Oleg Kononenko until September.\n\nIf they're all onboard the orbiting laboratory at once, the population would reach 13, tying the all-time record set exactly 15 years ago in July 2009.\n\nIn addition to today's discussions that would either prevent or accommodate for the possible record-tying rendezvous, there will soon be a new hot-fire test for Starliner.\n\nAfter weeks of testing at NASA's White Sands Testing Facility in New Mexico, NASA and Boeing personnel think they've got an idea about what's been causing the thruster problems that have left Wilmore and Williams stuck in space. On either Saturday or Sunday, Stich says, mission control will send commands to fire Starliner's thrusters through a number of pulses to further evaluate the system.\n\nNASA and Boeing leadership have said over the last month that Starliner is safe for the crew to use in case of an emergency scenario where they'd need to vacate the ISS. They've added that, since Starliner's problematic hardware will be discharged into space, teams won't get the chance to take those components apart to actually see what caused their issue. This is the reason they've given for Starliner's crew remaining in space: As long as the thrusters still exist, they can go back and forth between the ground and orbital tests to get as much information as possible.\n\nStich provided a vague return window. Wilmore and Williams won't land before mid- to late-August, he said, pending other procedures.\n\nIf Wilmore and Williams weren't satisfied with making history as Starliner's first flight test crew, they may have the crowded ISS record-tie under their belts, too.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Crew-7", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Crew-7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Dominick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Dominick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanette_Epps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeanette Epps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz MS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Hague", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Hague"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tracy Caldwell Dyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barratt_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Barratt (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephanie Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Chub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikolai Chub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Kononenko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oleg Kononenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/25/3e0ac688/iss056e201248~large.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763073", "eventUri": "eng-9763073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 823, "textEnd": 829}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-07-", "textStart": 2297, "textEnd": 2306}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

To address this, NASA is holding a media teleconference tonight at 9 pm IST to update everyone on the mission's status and what's being done to resolve the issues.\n\nThe conference will discuss the latest on the Boeing Crew Flight Test mission, including the \"ground hot fire testing\" being conducted. This testing is crucial for ensuring that the Starliner spacecraft can safely return home. Essentially, these tests simulate real flight conditions to make sure everything works as it should during re-entry.\n\nRecently, NASA and Boeing tested the Starliner's thrusters at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico. This involved running simulations of various flight scenarios, like approaching the space station and dealing with stress during undocking and re-entry. Unfortunately, there have been several delays due to technical problems like helium leaks, malfunctioning thrusters, and faulty propellant valves. For instance, some thrusters have overheated, and the helium leaks, which pressurize the thrusters, seem to be related to their frequency of use.\n\nNASA's commercial crew manager, Steve Stich, noted that these overheating issues are linked to how often the thrusters are used and the associated helium leaks. Despite these setbacks, Sunita Williams expressed confidence during a recent press conference. She mentioned the extensive simulations they've undergone and reassured that if any problems arise, they're prepared to handle them and safely return home.\n\nWilliams also shared her optimism about the spacecraft's ability to bring them back safely, saying, \"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Test Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sunita-williams-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763073", "eventUri": "eng-9763073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Barry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Butch\u00e2\u20ac Wilmore and pilot Sunita \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suni\u00e2\u20ac Williams to the International Space Station last month, courtesy of United Launch Alliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Atlas V rocket.\n\nFive small helium leaks, believed to be caused by a faulty seal, were discovered in a flange of the spacecraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service module\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thruster system.\n\nThe helium helps with the pressurization of the thrusters.\n\nSpeaking of the thrusters, five aft reaction control system thrusters on the service module failed during the approach of the International Space Station on Thursday, June 6. They are used to help maneuver Starliner, named Calypso, to and from the space station.\n\nAfter conducting a hot-fire test, four of the five were re-selected and working. The fifth one is not functioning and has been deselected for the rest of the mission.\n\nDespite the five leaks, officials have assured that Starliner has enough helium for the return trip home.\n\nStich said the Starliner team conducted a hot-fire test on a spare thruster at its White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico.\n\nHe said this helped engineers understand how the four-working thrusters on Starliner can handle the re-entry to Earth.\n\nThe testing was done in two parts: The uphill phase copied the flight of the Starliner and its docking with the International Space Station. The downhill phase focused on the undocking and return to Earth.\n\nA team of engineers replicated what happened to the thrusters during docking day with this spare thruster. What was revealed is that the fifth downhill test, there was degradation of the thruster, the same kind that was seen with Calypso is in orbit, he said.\n\nThis spare thruster has been disassembled at the White Sands Facility and is being looked over, Stich said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we are looking very carefully at the \u00e2\u20ac| fuel valve and the oxidizer valve. There are two valves that open and close as the thruster is commanded to allow propellant to enter into the combustion chamber, the injector and then the combustion,\u00e2\u20ac he explained.\n\nWhat was revealed during that test is that there is a bulge in the Teflon seal that is restricting the flow of fuel in the spare thruster, which reflects what was seen during the flight, he said. This seal is different than the ones that are believed to be causing the helium leak.\n\nStich revealed that the weekend of July 27 and 28, officials will be conducting a hot-fire test of the operational thrusters on the Starliner as it is docked on the space station.\n\nWhat will be done is that 27 of the thrusters on Starliner will be fired, but not the aft thruster that has been de-selected, Stich said.\n\nSpeaking of which, spare seals have also been tested back on Earth to figure out the cause of the helium leaks. It has been six weeks since they have been checked and officials want an update on them, he said. It was last checked on June 15.\n\nOnce the thrusters are doing a hot-fire test, they can determine what the leak rate is.\n\nOnce the tests are completed and data collected, NASA will be doing a readiness review to determine when the Starliner crew can return home, said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager at Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commercial Crew Program.\n\nWhen pressed by Spectrum News if the NASA-Boeing team feel that Starliner is not safe to return the pair, what other option do they have.\n\nStich admitted that there is a backup option and did mention Boeing rival SpaceX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dragon spacecraft.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, I mean obviously, the luxury in our program today we have never really had this option in other NASA programs is that we have two different systems that we are flying. Obviously, the backup option is to use a different system. I would rather not go into all of those details until we get to that time, if we ever get to that time on what we plan to do. \u00e2\u20ac| The beauty of having Dragon and Starliner, two different, diverse space transportation systems is that we can, we can kind of use those as a backup. Some day Starliner can be back up to a Dragon mission. And we have looked at all different contingencies for that. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the Russians send up an empty Soyuz, right, to return a crew when they had a coolant leak. So, I think the beauty of what we have in commercial crew is two different systems and we would employ those systems if we need to.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nNASA and Boeing have made significant progress with their ground tests for the Starliner spacecraft, currently docked to the International Space Station (ISS). Starliner took off on June 5th, and while the ship was initially expected to spend a week at the station, its return has been delayed because of helium leaks and thruster problems. As part of their process to understand the reasons behind the thruster anomalies, NASA and Boeing ran ground tests in White Sands.\n\nRepresentatives from the agency and the company shared key learnings from the tests in a conference earlier today, which give them confidence in setting a launch date for Starliner's return.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Manager Steve Stich started his opening remarks by sharing the progress of the agency and Boeing with their ground tests at White Sands. He explained that teams put \"the thruster through the profile that it saw during the flight in terms of replicating the firings for the uphill phase, including the docking day where some of these thrusters failed off and then replicate the downhill phase.\" As part of this process, NASA and Boeing simulated the thruster firing to mimic the conditions it saw during docking to the ISS, which was the first time the thrusters lost power.\n\nThey also ran \"five different downhill profiles.\" The last profile degraded the thruster, which provided key details similar to the degradation that the thrusters in space have experienced, including reduced thrust. NASA is now taking apart the thruster on the ground to understand the reasons behind the failure. These include analyzing the fuel and oxidizer valves, as well as a \"bulge in a Teflon seal which can restrict the flow\" of propellants to the thruster.\n\nThe key bit of analysis in this process is to see if \"that particular seal survive the rest of the flight,\" explained Stich. This will determine the course of action that NASA and Boeing take when deciding to bring Starliner's crew home. Current tests show that the thruster could \"survive, you know, up to five downhill legs,\" added Stich, with NASA's focus being to ensure that the seal remains intact throughout the rest of Starliner's journey.\n\nNASA and Boeing ran tests before CFT on a secondary Starliner service module, and seals in this module have experienced \"severe degradation from NTO vapor,\" according to the NASA official. NTO (nitrogen tetroxide) is the fuel for the thrusters, and teams are also working to understand this impact.\n\nTo further understand the degradation on Starliner's thrusters, NASA and Boeing will run another thruster firing over the weekend. As opposed to ground tests, this will fire the thrusters on the ship currently docked to ISS. It will fire 27 thrusters, excluding the thruster with low thrust, to ensure the \"whole system performs the way we expect it, and the way it did last time we checked it,\" outlined Stich. NASA will run an agency review as early as late next week, after which it will decide when to bring the crew home.\n\nAccording to Stich, the key parameters that NASA has to understand before it can bring the crew home are the helium leaks, leak stability and management in case they get worse, establishing an acceptable leak rate before departure, the weekend's test and understanding how the results from the ground tests might affect all thrusters on Starliner.\n\nBoeing's Commercial Crew Manager Mark Nappi shared key details about the thruster leaks and the tests with the secondary service module. He explained that teams have \"additional confidence\" to undock from the station due to the tests. The thruster tests revealed that \"there's some Teflon from a seal where the NTO enters the thruster, and that seal was eroded.\" According to Nappi, this material \"lodged in a downstream filter,\" which \"may be part of the cause of the degradation\" that the crew experienced while they docked to the ISS.\n\nAccording to Nappi, the \"bigger\" finding for the thruster anomaly involves the flow of the NTO to the thruster's injector. In this path, there is a \"poppet that opens and closes and allows that NTO to go through.\" This poppet is similar in size to a bike tire's valve, and it has a Teflon seal that deformed because of the \"heating and the natural vacuum that occurs with the thruster firing,\" which made it bulge out and restrict the fuel flow.\n\nThe Boeing executive believes these findings are \"likely the root cause\" and will lead to final fixes. Currently, Boeing is running a flow analysis with the clogged fuel filter and bulged Teflon to see if it can recreate the flight anomaly.\n\nNASA's Stich stressed that his agency would fly the crew home on Starliner since the ship was designed to undock with crew on board. NASA is in the final stages of its flight rationale for return, and before the return, NASA and Boeing will hold more meetings, including an agency return review. The return includes crew recovery on Earth, which is crucial for NASA to test out with Starliner for the first time.\n\nThe test flight has allowed NASA to understand the integrated effect of commanding too many pulses on the thruster, having the thruster pointed towards the Sun, running additional firings and the thrusters located inside the doghouse, which acts as an insulator, according to Stich. These will lead NASA to decide whether the problem lies with the thrusters, its seals, the firing profile or other Starliner systems to solve the problem.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dinitrogen tetroxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polytetrafluoroethylene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxidizing agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vacuum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BOEING-STARLINER-ORBIT-RENDER.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763073", "eventUri": "eng-9763073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 322, "textEnd": 330}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

We're making great progress, but we're just not quite ready to do that.\"\n\nTwo technical hurdles remain: tests this weekend to \"hot fire\" 27 maneuvering thrusters in the Starliner's service module to make sure they will work as expected between undocking and re-entry; and parallel testing to confirm five known helium leaks in the propulsion pressurization system have not worsened.\n\nPressurized helium is used to force propellants to the thrusters for ignition. The thrusters, in turn, are needed to re-orient the Starliner as required after undocking and to keep it steady when larger rockets fire to drop the ship out of orbit for re-entry and landing.\n\n\"We're going to fire all those thrusters through a number of pulses, just to make sure before we undock, that the whole system performs the way we expected and the way it did last time we checked it,\" Stich said. \"We'll also get a chance to look at the helium system.\n\n\"It's been six weeks since we last checked that helium system, that was on June 15. So we'll pressurize manifold by manifold, and then hot fire the thrusters, and then we'll get a chance to look at the helium leak rates and verify that the system is stable.\"\n\nAll in all, \"it's a very important set of tests over the weekend that we'll do,\" he said.\n\nAssuming no major surprises crop up, a NASA flight readiness review will be held to outline the problems for senior management, along with the \"flight rationale,\" that is, the analysis showing the problems are understood and pose no credible safety threat.\n\n\"There's some significant education of the leadership heading into this agency flight readiness review,\" Stich said. \"We've struggled to explain all of what's going on, and I apologize for that. This is a very, very complicated subject.\"\n\nThe Starliner was launched on its first piloted test flight June 5.

But the capsule's undocking was delayed because of faulty thrusters and small helium leaks that raised safety concerns.\n\nLast month, a spokesperson from Boeing said the helium leaks and most of the thruster problems had been \"all stable and not a concern for the return mission\".\n\n\"Four of the five thrusters that were previously shutting down are now operating normally. This means only one thruster out of 27 is currently offline. This does not present an issue for the return mission,\" the spokesperson said at the time.\n\nNasa and Boeing officials have said that the astronauts are not stranded and that the technical difficulties do not threaten the mission.\n\nEarlier this month, Nasa announced it was still performing tests to ensure the capsule would perform as expected, and said that even though they were confident the craft would be safe for an emergency evacuation, the mission managers were not yet ready to schedule its departure.\n\nOn Thursday, Nasa and Boeing officials said they were not ready to announce a return date, and that the pilots would remain at the space station until the engineers finish working on and examining the issues with the capsule.\n\n\"We'll come home when we're ready,\" Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager said in the press conference, according to the Associated Press. He also acknowledged that backup options are under review, including using other capsules to get the astronauts home safely, which he said was a top priority.\n\nEngineers recently completed testing on a spare thruster in the New Mexico desert, according to Nasa, which will be further examined in an attempt to understand what went wrong. According to AP, officials say that the issues appear to have been caused by degraded seals, though more analysis is needed.\n\nThis is not the first time the Starliner mission, which is the first time the spacecraft has carried a crew to space, has dealt with technical issues.

This lack of trust in Boeing to get even the basics right is bleeding over to the Boeing Starliner mission, in a totally different domain, where the general public at least trusts a little bit in NASA to handhold this wayward private company through the rigorous testing requirements of NASA, but here, NASA themselves do not have a great track record, especially when it comes to private suppliers.\n\nThere is no miscommunication or lack of transparency, and that is not what Boeing needs to do better. Boeing needs to commit better, repair better, maintain much better, regain trust, and make absolutely sure anything that comes out with your branding on it, actually works. That is not the case this time, again. When the global media pulls NASA and Boeing Down for not sticking to their original mission plan, it is a justified question, even though NASA and Boeing triple underlined the fact that this was supposed to be a minimum 8 day mission that has been extended indefinitely. Space missions are meant to be precisely planned, this is the bare minimum expectation for space travel. It's great that more science was done, but stay focused on the Starliner, and the engineering culture at Boeing. We, the entire planet, feel like you, the Boeing and NASA people are playing with the lives of two astronauts while you try to figure out a problem that you do not know how to fix. Well, have you figured it out?\n\nWe are looking for a return date. Do not pretend for a second that it is all fine, and you have the luxury of time. Program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program said, \"We don't have an announcement today relative to a return date. Uhhhh... we're making great progress, but we are just not quite ready to do that hmmph. We are here to be open and transparent and talk about you know all the great learning that's happened.\"\n\nBoeing decided to extend the mission indefinitely to conduct a comprehensive testing of the reaction control thrusters housed in the service module, which will burn up on reentry. At the White Sands facility in New Mexico, the entire sequence of firings from the deployment after launch were conducted, in a vacuum environment, that also simulated the influence of solar radiation. A number of problems developed on the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft. The testing also included the burns for the next phase of the mission, which is the undocking and return to Earth.\n\nThe Boeing engineers crossed off fields a complex tree diagram of potential problems to identify the fail conditions that they could fix permanently for future Starliner flights. They basically busted a future thruster on the ground to find out how it could perform in extreme situations. Well, the testing could replicate the same kind of thrust degradation that is being observed on the actual Boeing Starliner. NASA is attempting to understand the problem better by disassembling the busted thruster. This is actually brilliant, because they cannot do it on the actual Service Module, but the testing is revealing what engineers would find out if they had magical access to it.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner is meant to be autonomous, but has a provision for manual control when the situation demands it. Apparently, manual control put more stress on the thrusters, according to the testing. So Sunita Williams, the Pilot, and Barry Wilmore, the Commander of the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test will have reduced options for manual control during the next phase of the mission, which is the undocking and return.\n\nMark Nappi, the Starliner Programme manager for Boeing had something totally obtuse and unrelatable to start with, \"The last time we talked to you, we had 33 actions to complete in order to get to a place where we thought we had a good vehicle to come home and we could learn something about the root cause.\" Nappi went on to clarify that the Boeing Starliner is ready to come home and that Boeing has identified faulty connectors in the propulsion system, with the Teflon seals deforming in the microgravity environment of space.\n\nBoeing wants to now conduct an additional round of tests on the Boeing Starliner to ensure that it performs as the ground teams expect, and evaluate the status of the helium tank leaks.

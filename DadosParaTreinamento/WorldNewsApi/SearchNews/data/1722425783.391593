The world\u2019s first cat food made with lab-grown chicken is gearing up to launch in the U.S. later in the year. Meatly, the London-based startup, has created cruelty-free, faux-chicken cat food grown from a single fertilized egg. It will be available to buy first at Pets at Home stores in the U.K. later this summer as part of their sustainable initiative. Talking from his bijou North London garden with his cats buzzing around him, Owen Ensor, the co-founder and chief executive, said, \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to see the first ever cans of cultivated pet food fly off the production line. We have a R&D partnership with a large pet-food manufacturer in America and are currently going through the regulatory hurdles. The model we have in the U.K. with a retailer and manufacturer relationships works well, so ideally we\u2019ll try to replicate that with someone like PetSmart and Petco.\u201d Meatly\u2019s 150g (5oz) tins of cultivated-chicken cat food will cost roughly \u00a31 ($1.25). Cultivated meat, also known as cell-based or clean meat, is produced by culturing animal cells in a giant stainless-steel tanks, much like brewing beer. The company\u2019s scientists extracted \u201ca sample of cells from a single chicken egg\u201d and grow them into a product that is biologically indistinguishable from the flesh of a slaughtered bird. It is also free of hormones, steroids and antibiotics\u2014all things commonly found in meat, organic or otherwise. \u201cNobody has died for it. We didn\u2019t have to raise and kill an animal,\u201d Ensor said, \u201cWe use far less resources of water and land, less greenhouse emissions and we\u2019re not razing rainforests, polluting rivers and oceans. We get to sidestep all of those issues while still providing healthy meat that\u2019s far kinder.\u201d Ensor, a relatively recent convert to veganism, has tried the first product himself, which he said \u201ctastes just like chicken.\u201d He has also tested the cultivated-chicken dish on his own two rescue ginger tabbies Lamu and Zanzi, \u201cwho love it.\u201d Growing up in Edinburgh, Ensor, 35, started in consulting before shifting to the bio-tech world. \u201cI wanted to work in developing countries and for a social enterprise because I thought it would be an interesting mix of capitalistic intentions and social impact. That\u2019s how I found Sanargy in Kenya, creating a zero-waste system by using organic waste to feed insects which we sold as animal feed. At the same time, after watching Cowspiracy, [my wife] Harriet and I became vegan. I started questioning, \u2018Do I want to be breeding insects and selling them as chicken feed?\u2019 Even though it\u2019s part of this great zero-waste system. When we came back to the U.K., I did some work with multinationals on their plant-based food strategies and got interested in the food world because it\u2019s real.\u201d Reflecting the growing trend for socially-conscious pet \u2018parents\u2019 to feed their companion animals veggie diets, there\u2019s a wide range of plant and potato-based products already available like the California-based Wild Earth and New York\u2019s Bramble Pets. Animal lovers, especially vegans and vegetarians, grapple with the conflict between their pet\u2019s natural diets and their ethical stance of animal exploitation and environmental destruction of meat production. While dogs who are omnivores thrive on well-balanced plant-rich diets and may even live longer than meat-eating dogs, it\u2019s wholly unsuitable and detrimental for cats who must remaincarnivores. It\u2019s why Meatly\u2019s first product is for cats, \u201cas there\u2019s no credible meat-free substitute. Cats can\u2019t make taurine, and the only way they can get it is from animal-protein sources.\u201d Meatly is also planning a product for dogs \u201cas a lot of people don\u2019t want to feed their dogs a plant diet.\u201d The aim is to produce a new generation of cat and dog food that doesn\u2019t rely on farmed animals, as a compassionate, more environmentally friendly alternative to killing billions of animals and destroying the planet in order to meet demand. Cultivated-meat pet food could have profound ethical and environmental advantages. Petcare giants like Nestle Global that produce low-quality fare like Purina, Friskies and Fancy Feast view lab-grown meat and meat-free options as a market opportunity. Other pet-food companies are wary of the industry disruption or skeptical about the long-term health impact of these alternative protein sources. \u201cClean meat makes sense in every way, but the question is whether it will be safe for our cats and dogs,\u201d said Lorenzo Capellino, CEO of Almo Nature, a premium human-grade cat and dog food that is unique among pet-food brands in that it gives 100 percent of its profits to European animal shelters and wildlife projects. \u201cAlmo Nature has decided to follow the research very closely, albeit with an absolute line of caution. Pet food could be one of the first areas in which these proteins will be tested, but we will only use these ingredients when there\u2019s sufficient evidence of their suitability to meet the nutritional needs of dogs and cats.\u201d \u201cI think once we\u2019re able to prove that it\u2019s safe and commercially viable the winds of change will come,\u201d Ensor said. \u201cOne of the questions I get is \u2018what is it, what does it look like?\u2019 Until people get to see it and experience it, the newness is a bit difficult. People care deeply about their companion animals and what\u2019s best for them, so we need to provide that reassurance.\u201d Globally, the pet-food industry is booming and pets currently account for a fifth of the world\u2019s meat consumption. The industry\u2019s carbon footprint could weigh even more heavily in the years to come, as companion animal numbers grow. By 2026, Meatly estimates that the market is set to grow by seven percent a year, representing about $150 billion. \u201cAbout 40 percent of pet food worldwide is sold in the U.S., so it\u2019s a huge market but the quality can be very challenging. There are a lot of recalls, animals die and humans die with the contamination.\u201d Meatly is among several other startups\u2014such as BioCraft Pet Nutrition and Bond Pet Foods in the U.S. and Bene and Hill\u2019s Nutrition in Europe\u2014on a quest to cut animal agriculture out of the equation by using cell-cultured meat, producing a healthier, more sustainable option for the world\u2019s pets. If all cats and dogs in the U.S. alone switched to cultivated-meat or plant-based protein two billion livestock and billions of aquatic animals might be spared from being killed. Most pet food is a by-product of the meat industry and much of it comes from farmed animals that are \u2018dead, diseased, dying, disabled\u2019\u2014the 4Ds as it\u2019s known within industry\u2014all of which makes them unfit for human consumption. \u201cThat\u2019s mostly in the U.S., it happens less in the U.K.,\u201d Ensor pointed out. \u201cBut with the soaring demand, that\u2019s changing. Nearly 50 percent of pet meat can be fed to humans, so companion animals are already competing with the human food chain.\u201d Higher-welfare pet food exists, but it\u2019s extremely expensive and rare, particularly in the U.S., where 99 percent of meat comes from factory-farmed animals who live short, brutal lives under cruel conditions. Even so, more than 30 percent of farmed animals are turned into pet food, so in effect the meat industry is propped up and made profitable by pet food. In fact, the biggest American corporate slaughterhouses like Tyson and Cargill Foods own multiple pet-food brands as a way to recycle dead, diseased and dying farm animals and the so-called \u2018waste\u2019 of carcasses\u2014hooves, beaks, bones, blood, intestines and other undesirable body parts. Disturbingly, even euthanized cats and dogs reportedly make into pet food. Recently several American pet foods issued recalls after detecting traces of pentobarbital, a sedative normally used to euthanize cats, dogs and horses, in its products. When cultured meat for companion animals is sold on an industrial scale it will make a monumental impact on so many levels, especially for farmed animals. Ensor believes clean-meat will not only change the way we feed our cats and dogs but it\u2019s also a stride toward more humane, sustainable, safer and even healthier alternative to conventional choices. \u201cI think what\u2019s great is that we\u2019re only scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible.\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/240628-cat-food-lab-grown-hero_mghdpv\"/><figcaption>Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast</figcaption></figure><p>LONDON\u2014Would you feed your pets <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-tasty-mission-to-get-you-to-eat-lab-made-meat#:~:text=Emma%20Ignaszewski%2C%20associate%20director%20of,criteria%20for%20naming%20an%20emerging\">meat grown in a lab</a>?</p><p>The world\u2019s first cat food made with lab-grown chicken is gearing up to launch in the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/united-states\">U.S. </a>later in the year.</p><p>Meatly, the London-based startup, has created cruelty-free, faux-chicken cat food grown from a single fertilized egg.

The People's Bank of China is studying the implementation with the Ministry of Finance and it will be a gradual process, he said in a speech.\n\nThis responds to Xi's directive to enrich the monetary policy toolkit and gradually increase the buying and selling of government bonds under central banks' open market operations, in a speech delivered at a financial policy meeting last year, made public only in the book published in March.\n\nSome PBOC observers view the proposals as part of a decades-long shift in which the central bank has gradually allowed markets to play a greater role in determining interest rates.\n\nThe People's Bank of China is also moving toward price-based tools, such as interest rates, and downplaying quantity-based tools, such as credit amount. Pan said Wednesday it was time to pay less attention to loan growth as borrowing by real estate developers and local governments is declining amid the economic transition.\n\nAdopting a short-term interest rate linked to the financial market as the main policy rate would be an obvious further step in the gradual reform of China's monetary policy framework, said Louis Kuijs, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific at S&P Global Ratings. This would make the framework simpler and more transparent, and bring it closer to industry standards as practiced in most advanced economies.\n\nOthers believe the changes give the People's Bank of China greater influence over short-term rates and potentially longer-term rates.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, said the PBOC's bond trading is an additional tool that allows it to micromanage, essentially, the entire curve. This would be similar to yield curve control, he said, referring to the Bank of Japan's policy of removing long-term borrowing costs to revive the economy. China's emphasis on efficient use of credit rather than rapid expansion also points to a more central direction, according to Neumann.\n\nOne conclusion many analysts drew from Pan's speech is that the PBOC is preparing to downplay what has been one of its main instruments: the one-year policy loans known as the Medium-Term Loan Facility . Since its introduction a decade ago, the MLF has become a major channel for the central bank to inject money into the economy and guide market rates.\n\nBut in recent months, banks' demand for these funds has slowed as it has become cheaper for them to borrow from each other. The MLF interest rate has remained stable for 10 months, even as other borrowing costs in the economy have plunged, in part because the PBOC is wary of currency depreciation.\n\nAdditionally, MLF is also only available to certain banks. By buying and selling sovereign bonds as an alternative means of managing liquidity, central bankers can influence the financial conditions of a wider range of market participants. And compared to MLF, the rate of seven-day short-term loans offered daily to banks provides more flexibility for fine-tuning their policy.\n\nPan might believe that China's rates market is now mature enough for the central bank to stop using multiple pegs to guide it, according to Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.\n\nFinancial News, a PBOC-run newspaper, on Thursday cited anonymous industry experts saying the central bank should weaken the link between the MLF, which represents banks' funding costs, and the prime lending rate, a benchmark for the interest rates granted to the real economy.

The bank may consider moving to using a single short-term rate to guide markets. It's also considering narrowing the corridor within which market rates are allowed to fluctuate to signal a clearer policy target.\n\nTo be sure, all these moves aim to refine the technical tools that the PBOC uses to manage interest rates and money. They won't necessarily help answer some of the big questions that confront Chinese policymakers right now -- like whether credit can prop up the economy when households and companies aren't eager to take on more debt, or how to ease borrowing costs without weakening the yuan. Many details remain vague, along with the timeline for change.\n\nSome PBOC watchers see the proposals as part of a decades-long shift in which the central bank has gradually allowed markets more of a role in determining interest rates.\n\nThe PBOC is also moving toward price-based tools like interest rates and downplaying quantity-based tools such as the amount of credit.

And compared with the MLF, the rate on seven-day reverse repurchases -- short-term loans available to banks every day -- offers more flexibility for policy fine-tuning.\n\nPan may believe that China's rates market is now mature enough for the central bank to stop using multiple anchors to guide it, according to Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.\n\nFinancial News, a newspaper managed by the PBOC, on Thursday cited unnamed industry experts as saying that the central bank should weaken the link between MLF -- which represents banks' financing costs -- and the loan prime rate, a benchmark for lending rates to the real economy. The latter is more important because actual borrowers' costs matters more for economic growth, according to the report.\n\nCurrently, the LPRs are based on the interest rates that 20 banks offer their best customers. They are quoted as a spread over the MLF rate.\n\nOne likely goal is to ensure a smoother transmission mechanism from short-term interest rates to longer ones.\n\nThe PBOC's current setup of using two policy rates -- the seven-day reverse repo and the MLF -- reduces the signaling effect from its monetary decisions, Macquarie Group Ltd. economists led by Larry Hu argued in a report on Thursday.\n\nIn addition, the current interest rate corridor constructed by the PBOC -- the range within which market rates are supposed to move -- is too wide, they said, leading to a highly volatile market for seven-day interbank lending by comparison with much more stable rates in the US and Europe.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic

Three months later, plans for potentially the biggest change in years to how China conducts monetary policy are beginning to surface.\n\nPan Gongsheng, governor of People's Bank of Chinaclearly acknowledged on Wednesday that the monetary authority was considering trading government bonds on the secondary market as a way to regulate liquidity.THE People's Bank of China is studying the implementation with the Ministry of Finance and it will be a gradual process, he said in a speech.\n\nThis responds to Xi's directive to enrich the monetary policy toolkit and gradually increase the buying and selling of government bonds under central banks' open market operations, in a speech delivered at a financial policy meeting last year, made public only in the book published in March.\n\nIn addition to this, Pan hinted at other changes in the interest rate system. The bank could consider using a single short-term rate to guide markets. It also plans to narrow the corridor within which market rates can fluctuate to signal a clearer policy objective.\n\nCertainly, all of these measures are aimed at refining the technical tools that the PBOC uses to manage interest rates and money. They won't necessarily help answer some of the big questions facing Chinese policymakers now, such as whether credit can support the economy when households and businesses are unwilling to take on more debt, or how to reduce borrowing costs without weakening the yuan. Many details remain vague, as does the timeline for the change.\n\nPeople's Bank of China observers view the proposals as part of a long-term effort in which the central bank ultimately seeks to steer market interest rates rather than directly setting them and moving a little further away from the command economy where those responsible determined both the price and the quantity of credit. . Pan said Wednesday it was time to pay less attention to targets such as the pace of loan growth, as borrowing by real estate developers and local governments is declining amid the economic transition.\n\nAdopting a short-term interest rate linked to the financial market as the main policy rate would be an obvious further step in the gradual reform of China's monetary policy framework, said Louis Kuijs, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific at S&P Global Ratings. This would make the framework simpler and more transparent, and bring it closer to industry standards as practiced in most advanced economies.\n\nOne conclusion many analysts drew from Pan's speech is that the PBOC is preparing to downplay what has been one of its main instruments: the one-year policy loans known as the Medium-Term Loan Facility . Since its introduction a decade ago, the MLF has become a major channel for the central bank to inject money into the economy and guide market rates.\n\nBut in recent months, banks' demand for these funds has slowed as it has become cheaper for them to borrow from each other. The MLF interest rate has remained stable for 10 months, even as other borrowing costs in the economy have plunged, in part because the PBOC is wary of currency depreciation.\n\nAdditionally, MLF is also only available to certain banks. By buying and selling sovereign bonds as an alternative means of managing liquidity, central bankers can influence the financial conditions of a wider range of market participants. And compared to MLF, the rate of seven-day short-term loans offered daily to banks provides more flexibility for fine-tuning their policy.\n\nPan might believe that China's rates market is now mature enough for the central bank to stop using multiple pegs to guide it, according to Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.\n\nFinancial News, a PBOC-run newspaper, on Thursday cited anonymous industry experts saying the central bank should weaken the link between the MLF, which represents banks' funding costs, and the prime lending rate, a benchmark for the interest rates granted to the real economy. The latter point is more important because borrowers' real costs matter more for economic growth, according to the report.\n\nCurrently, LPRs are based on the interest rates that 20 banks offer to their best customers. They are quoted as a spread compared to the MLF rate.\n\nOne likely objective is to provide a smoother transmission mechanism from short-term interest rates to longer-term interest rates.\n\nThe People's Bank of China's current setup of using two policy rates, the seven-day reverse repo and the MLF, reduces the signaling effect of its monetary decisions, economists at Macquarie Group Ltd. have argued. led by Larry Hu in a report released Thursday.\n\nIn addition, the current interest rate corridor constructed by the People's Bank of China and the range within which market rates are expected to move is too wide, they said, leading to a highly volatile market for loans seven-day interbank lending rates compared to the much more stable seven-day interbank lending market rates.

Three months later, plans for potentially the biggest shift in years in how China conducts monetary policy are starting to surface.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China, on Wednesday gave the clearest acknowledgment that the monetary authority is looking into trading government bonds in the secondary market as a way to regulate liquidity. The PBOC is studying the implementation with the finance ministry and it will be a gradual process, he said in a speech.\n\nThat responds to Xi's directive to \"enrich the monetary policy toolbox\" and \"gradually increase government bond buying and selling in central bank open market operation\" in a speech during a financial policy meeting last year, made public only in the book published in March.\n\nOn top of that, Pan hinted at other changes to the interest-rate system. The bank may consider moving to using a single short-term rate to guide markets. It's also considering narrowing the corridor within which market rates are allowed to fluctuate to signal a clearer policy target.\n\nTo be sure, all these moves aim to refine the technical tools that the PBOC uses to manage interest rates and money. They won't necessarily help answer some of the big questions that confront Chinese policymakers right now -- like whether credit can prop up the economy when households and companies aren't eager to take on more debt, or how to ease borrowing costs without weakening the yuan. Many details remain vague, along with the timeline for change.\n\nPBOC watchers see the proposals as part of a long-running effort in which the central bank ultimately seeks to guide market interest rates rather than setting them directly -- and a step further away from the command economy where officials determined both the price and the quantity of credit. Pan said on Wednesday that it's time to pay less attention to targets like the pace of loan growth because borrowing by real estate developers and local governments is in decline as part of the economy's transition.\n\n\"Moving to one short-term interest rate that is connected to the financial market as the main policy rate would be an obvious further step in the gradual reform of China's monetary policy framework,\" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist for S&P Global Ratings. \"It would make the framework simpler and more transparent, and bring it closer to the 'industry standard' as practiced in most advanced economies.\"\n\nOne conclusion many analysts drew from Pan's speech is that the PBOC is preparing to downplay what's been one of its headline instruments: the one-year policy loans known as the medium-term lending facility. Since it was introduced a decade ago, the MLF has become a major channel for the central bank to inject money into the economy and guide market rates.\n\nBut in recent months, banks' demand for these funds has languished as it became cheaper for them to borrow from each other. The interest rate on the MLF has been held steady for 10 months, even as other borrowing costs in the economy plunged -- partly because the PBOC is wary of currency depreciation.\n\nWhat's more, the MLF is also only available to selected banks. By buying and selling sovereign bonds as an alternative way of managing liquidity, central bankers can influence financial conditions across a wider range of market participants. And compared with the MLF, the rate on seven-day reverse repurchases -- short-term loans available to banks every day -- offers more flexibility for policy fine-tuning.\n\nPan may believe that China's rates market is now mature enough for the central bank to stop using multiple anchors to guide it, according to Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.\n\nFinancial News, a newspaper managed by the PBOC, on Thursday cited unnamed industry experts as saying that the central bank should weaken the link between MLF -- which represents banks' financing costs -- and the loan prime rate, a benchmark for lending rates to the real economy. The latter is more important because actual borrowers' costs matters more for economic growth, according to the report.\n\nCurrently, the LPRs are based on the interest rates that 20 banks offer their best customers. They are quoted as a spread over the MLF rate.\n\nOne likely goal is to ensure a smoother transmission mechanism from short-term interest rates to longer ones.\n\nThe PBOC's current setup of using two policy rates -- the seven-day reverse repo and the MLF -- reduces the signaling effect from its monetary decisions, Macquarie Group Ltd. economists led by Larry Hu argued in a report on Thursday.\n\nIn addition, the current interest rate corridor constructed by the PBOC -- the range within which market rates are supposed to move -- is too wide, they said, leading to a highly volatile market for seven-day interbank lending by comparison with much more stable rates in the US and Europe.\n\n--With assistance from Fran Wang, Wenjin Lv and Katia Dmitrieva.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

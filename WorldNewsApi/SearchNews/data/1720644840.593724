The actress only opted to go the traditional bridal route once, wearing a classic white wedding dress to marry her first husband, Conrad \"Nicky\" Hilton, in 1950. For the rest of the ceremonies, Taylor chose to wear bold hues (one was even rainbow-colored!) and shorter hemlines. She also paired her wedding dresses with interesting accessories like sweeping hoods, floral hair accessories and stunning jewelry. Here's a look back at Elizabeth Taylor's eight iconic wedding gowns, from her first marriage in 1950 to her last in 1991. Taylor's traditional wedding dress to marry Conrad \u201cNicky\u201d Hilton on May 6, 1950 For her first wedding to Hilton at just 18 years old, Taylor opted for a classic wedding dress. She wore a cream-colored satin gown designed by Helen Rose. The dress featured a corset top, full A-line skirt, long sleeves and pearl embellishments throughout, with an off-the-shoulder sweetheart neckline and a sheer, high-neck overlay. She accessorized with a pearl tiara, veil and floral bouquet. Rose notably also designed Grace Kelly\u2019s wedding dress and Taylor\u2019s on-screen bridal look in the film Father of the Bride. In fact, that on-screen look partly inspired Taylor\u2019s real-life gown. Taylor and Hilton's wedding was a star-studded affair. Over 700 guests attended, many of them Hollywood superstars like Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Gene Kelly. However, the couple divorced about a year after the ceremony. In 2013, the dress sold at a London auction for $187,931, according to Christie's. Taylor's tea-length suit to wed Michael Wilding on Feb. 21, 1962 At her second wedding to English actor Michael Wilding, who was 20 years her senior, Taylor opted for a more serious and less glamorous look that was also designed by Rose. Instead of a gown, she wore a sophisticated suit, which featured a tea-length, A-line skirt. The top had a large collar and cuffed three-quarter-length sleeves. This time around, Taylor skipped the veil and tiara and instead opted to wear flowers in her hair that matched the small bouquet in her hands. She accessorized with a pearl necklace and not much else. Taylor and Wilding were married for nearly five years before divorcing in 1957. During their marriage, they had two boys together, Michael and Christopher. Taylor's hooded gown to marry Michael Todd on Feb. 2, 1957 Not long after divorcing Wilding, Taylor married Hollywood producer Michael Todd, who she would later refer to as the great love of her life. In her 1988 autobiography Elizabeth Takes Off, Taylor wrote, \u201cGod, I loved him. My self-esteem, my image, everything soared under his exuberant, loving care.\u201d The two got married in a small and intimate ceremony at City Hall in Acapulco, Mexico. For the ceremony, Taylor wore a stunning silk chiffon off-the-shoulder gown with a dramatic hood. The result was a traditional, daring and glamorous look. Taylor didn\u2019t accessorize with much besides her enormous engagement ring: the rock was 29 carats and Taylor referred to it as \u201cmy ice skating rink.\u201d Two of Taylor and Todd\u2019s closest friends attended the wedding: Debbie Reynolds, Taylor\u2019s matron of honor, and Reynolds' husband Eddie Fisher. Just a year later, in March 1958, Todd tragically died in a plane accident on a flight in his private plane, which was named after Taylor. The actress and Todd shared one daughter, Liza. Taylor's green silk dress to wed Eddie Fisher on May 12, 1959 After Todd died, Fisher, one of his closest friends, stayed by Taylor\u2019s side to comfort her. It wasn\u2019t long before Taylor and Fisher began having an affair, which was made extra scandalous by the fact that Fisher was married to Reynolds, who was Taylor\u2019s best friend. A year after Todd\u2019s plane crash, Taylor and Fisher got married. Fisher divorced Reynolds and gifted Taylor a 40-carat engagement bracelet instead of a ring. Taylor converted to Judaism, and the two got married at Temple Beth Shalom in Las Vegas in 1959. Taylor opted for a very non-traditional wedding look, wearing a green silk dress that featured sheer sleeves and a hood with a full skirt. The couple stayed together until 1964. Taylor and Reynolds eventually reconciled before Taylor's death in 2011, and Reynolds later told PEOPLE that she placed most of the blame on Fisher. \u201cI felt you can\u2019t make a man leave, you can\u2019t make him do something he doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe obviously chose to leave, didn\u2019t he? She didn\u2019t lasso him. She was just beautiful Elizabeth Taylor. And he wanted her, and he wanted to be her lover, so he left and he was. He was the selfish one. She just gave him what he wanted.\u201d Taylor's yellow dress to marry Richard Burton on March 15, 1964 About five years after marrying Fisher, Taylor ended things while having an affair with Welsh actor Richard Burton. The two met on the set of Cleopatra and got married just nine days after Taylor and Fisher ended their marriage. For her fifth wedding, Taylor again went a nontraditional route with her dress. She wore a knee-length marigold chiffon babydoll dress with an empire waist, long sleeves and a large collar. Her hair was done in a long, intricate braided updo decorated with hyacinths and lilies of the valley weaved throughout. She carried a small bouquet of yellow flowers that matched the color of her dress. Burton gave Taylor a platinum Bulgari pendant instead of an engagement ring, which featured an 18.61-carat emerald and diamonds. She wore it as a brooch during the ceremony. Taylor and Burton remained married for 10 years before divorcing, making her first marriage with Burton her longest. Taylor's tie-dye gown to wed Richard Burton (again) on Oct. 10, 1975 No, that\u2019s not a mistake: Taylor and Burton divorced in 1974 and got married again a little over a year later in 1975. They tied the knot for the second time in Botswana. Taylor\u2019s entire look was the epitome of 1970s style. She wore an empire-waist, tie-dye Gina Fratini dress that featured all the bright colors of the rainbow. It was embroidered with beading and feathers with huge, flowing long sleeves. She completed the look with a bohemian updo created with ribbons and flowers. The second marriage didn\u2019t last long: the two divorced for the second time nine months later, in 1976. Taylor\u2019s gown later sold at auction in 2011 for $62,500. Taylor's cashmere and fur outfit to marry Sen. John Warner on Dec. 4, 1976 For her seventh marriage, Taylor wed Sen. John Warner on Dec. 4, 1976. They had a small and intimate ceremony on his farm in Virginia. Taylor wore a purple cashmere dress and added a tweed and fur coat to stay warm. Her matching turban completed the unexpected look. The two divorced in 1982 but remained friendly. Taylor's yellow Valentino dress to wed Larry Fortensky on Oct. 6, 1991 For her eighth and final wedding, Taylor tied the knot with Larry Fortensky. The ceremony, which was probably the most lavish one she had, took place at Michael Jackson\u2019s Neverland Ranch in California. Although Taylor opted against wearing white, her gown still had a bridal feel. She wore a pale yellow, lace Valentino gown that was off-the-shoulder with a plunging sweetheart neckline. A full-tiered skirt completed the look. The bespoke gown was estimated to cost $25,000 and was gifted to Taylor by the designer. The wedding had about 160 guests, with stars like Liza Minnelli, Eddie Murphy, Diane von Furstenberg and Brooke Shields in attendance. Five years later, Taylor went through her last divorce and ended her marriage with Fortensky. He later opened up to PEOPLE about Taylor, saying, \u201cI have wonderful memories of my time with Elizabeth, and I will treasure her memory forever. I love her. I always will. And I know she loved me, too.\u201d She vowed to never marry again, and she didn\u2019t.", "summary": "From her traditional 1950s wedding gown to her two yellow dresses, here&#39;s a look back at Elizabeth Taylor&#39;s unique bridal style", "url": "https://people.com/all-about-elizabeth-taylor-wedding-dresses-8639631", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/vw8JyVnFq1vYaQUCfuh9H85AsT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1016x487:1018x489)/elizabeth-taylor-wedding-dresses-1-edf142067fef4d27949c8eb866b8ed53.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:39:20", "author": "Jessica Booth", "authors": ["Jessica Booth"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.666}

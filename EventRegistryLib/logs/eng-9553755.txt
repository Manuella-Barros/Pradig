It will also have a roof terrace cocktail bar with a licence to 3am.\n\nAlso on the 60th story will be a 14-seat chef's table, an offshoot from his three Michelin-starred flagship, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea.\n\nJust below, on the 59th level, will be a branch of the restaurateur's Bread Street Kitchen & Bar chain. Meanwhile, the Gordon Ramsay Academy, which is sponsored by the cookware brand HexClad, will teach skills in \"everything from pasta-making to mixology.\"\n\nReservations for the 22 Bishopsgate restaurants will open in September.\n\nRamsay said of the new venture: \"This is more than just a new opening -- it's a significant milestone for our business. We're not only launching the highest culinary experiences in London, but also creating a vibrant culinary hub at the incredible 22 Bishopsgate.\n\n\"I'm so proud of the hard work from our teams. I cannot wait to share this unique dining experience with our guests.\"\n\nThe new openings are the latest moves in a remarkable \"space race\" for an activity that has historically been based at pavement or basement level. But the trend for \"dining with altitude\" in London arguably began in 1963 with the opening of London Hilton, near Hyde Park Corner, London's first skyscraper hotel.

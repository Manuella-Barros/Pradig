He appeared in over 70 episodes of the Hart-led sitcom as Principal Willard Kraft from 1997 to 2000. Looking back at their off-camera bond, Hart posted a throwback photo of her and Mull posing in costume together on set. \"Rest in Peace my friend. The incredible #MartinMull (Principal Kraft) has left us for his eternal rest,\" she began in the caption, adding, \"I have such fond memories of working with him and being in awe of his huge body of work which before #SabrinaTheTeemageWitch included #Roseanne and #MrMom as the projects I knew him from.\" She saluted Mull for his appearances on \"huge shows as well as features and animation\" following his time on Sabrina.

His film credits include Clue, Far Out Man and Mrs. Doubtfire. Most recently, he had guest appearances in Not Dead Yet, Grace and Frankie and The Afterparty. In her Instagram tribute, Hart shared how Mull explained why he took so many roles. \"He once told me that he takes every job he's offered just in case the train comes to an end, which in this business tends to halt quickly,\" wrote Hart. \"He was an artist who liked to paint and build things with his hands, a musician and a wonderful man who i am better for knowing. \" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

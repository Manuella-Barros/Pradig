Here are some of the key congressional races to watch in each state.\n\nFive Republicans and two Democrats are running in Kansas' 2nd Congressional District after two-term U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner, R-KS announced he would not seek reelection in April.The leading GOP candidates in a solidly conservative seat are former state attorney general Derek Schmidt, former LaTurner aide Jeff Kahrs, rancher Shawn Tiffany, veteran Michael Ogle, and Chad Young. Schmidt and Kahrs lead the others in campaign contributions, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Nancy Boyda and former University of Kansas basketball player Matt Kleinmann face off in the Democratic primary.\n\nKansas's 2nd Congressional District leans Republican, voting for former President Donald Trump by over 55% in 2016 and 2020.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nIn Kansas' 3rd Congressional District, Republican physician Prasanth Reddy and small business owner Karen Crnkovich are facing off to challenge the state's lone Democratic member of Congress, Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kans. Reddy currently leads Crnkovich in fundraising.\n\nThe swing district, which is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area, went for Trump in 2016 but for President Joe Biden in 2020. Davids has served for three terms and won reelection in 2022 with 55% of the vote.\n\nMichigan: U.S. Senate seat\n\nThere's a rare opening for a U.S. Senate seat after Sen. Debbie Stabenow announced her retirement and a crowded field has sprung up to fill it.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hill Harper, businessman, author, and probably most recognized for his acting roles in T.V. shows like \"The Good Doctor\" and \"CSI: N.Y.,\" is running against first-term U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence official and acting assistant secretary in the Defense Department who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District. Slotkin is expected to win.\n\nThe Republican primary is leading with former Rep. Mike Rogers against ex-Congressman Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell, a former congressional candidate.\n\nMichigan: U.S. House races\n\nDemocrats currently hold the majority of Michigan's congressional delegation, 7-6, but seats are up for grabs in several districts that could decide control of the U.S. House.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Republicans Paul Hudson and Michael Markey are running for the chance to challenge incumbent Democratic first-term U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who has her own primary challenger in Salim Al-Shatel but is favored to win.\n\nIn the 8th District, U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., is stepping down from Congress this year after six terms. Three Democrats and three Republicans are running in their respective primaries.\n\nIn the 10th District, Democrat Carl Marlinga, Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley, and Diane Young are vying for the Democratic nomination against Republican Rep. John James. James barely beat out Marlinga in this race two years ago.\n\nMissouri: U.S. House seats\n\nDemocratic incumbent Rep. Cori Bush is expected to have a run for her money against St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell in the party's primary for Missouri's 1st District.\n\nBell, who has backing from pro-Israel groups, is attacking Bush, who is being framed as a partisan disruption to Democratic cooperation in the House. A member of \"The Squad\" made up of progressive congressional Democrats, if Bush falls short of votes, she would be the second ouster following New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman's stunning upset in June.\n\nTwo other Democrats, Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Ron Harshaw, will also appear on the Democratic ballot. Five candidates are on the Republican primary ballot.\n\nIn the 8th District, centrist Democrat Rep. Kim Schrier faces disruption from a new candidate focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Meanwhile, in the 3rd District, Trump-endorsed Joe Kent is looking to unseat Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in what appears to be a tightly contested race.\n\nWashington has a nonpartisan primary system in which all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of party, and the top two finishers in the race advance to the general election.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nTwo years ago, Democrat Gluesenkamp Perez pulled off a major upset by winning a congressional seat against Trump-backed candidate Joe Kent in a district that hadn't voted Democratic in over a decade. Now, with Trump's endorsement again, Kent is back to reclaim the seat in Washington's southwest corner. However, he faces strong competition from former King County Prosecutor Leslie Lewallen, who has raised $820,000 compared to Kent's nearly $1.4 million. Lewallen focuses on crime and homelessness, criticizing both Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent for being too extreme.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez has outpaced her challengers with $6.7 million in fundraising. She supports abortion access and climate change policies while advocating for increased border security to combat the fentanyl crisis. Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for President Biden's impeachment, accuses Gluesenkamp Perez of pretending to be a moderate.\n\n4th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse faces Trump-endorsed Jerrod Sessler and former nurse Tiffany Smiley in Washington's reddest congressional district, spanning from the Canadian border to the Columbia River. Newhouse, one of the few Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, focuses on agriculture and border security, key issues for a district reliant on immigrant labor.\n\nSessler, a Navy veteran and ex-NASCAR driver, proudly embraces Trump's endorsement, while Smiley criticizes Newhouse's stance on Trump. Newhouse has raised $1.6 million, outpacing Smiley and Sessler combined.\n\n5th Congressional District\n\nTen candidates are battling to succeed McMorris Rogers, who has served in Congress for two decades, in the Fifth District, a Republican-leaning district encompassing the eastern third of the state and Spokane.\n\nSix Republicans and four Democrats are competing for the top two spots to advance to the November ballot. (A fifth Democrat, Bobbi Bennett-Wolcott, will also appear on the ballot despite dropping out in July.) Republican Spokane Country treasurer and former state Sen. Michael Baumgartner is the race's top fundraiser, while OBGYN Dr. Bernadine Bank holds a slight lead over the Democratic candidates in campaign contributions.\n\n6th Congressional District\n\nIn Washington's Sixth Congressional District, 5 candidates are vying to replace retiring Rep. Derek Kilmer (D). This includes state senators Emily Randall (D) and Drew MacEwen (R), Washington Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz (D), and independent Graham Ralston. Each one brings a different perspective on addressing the district's challenges, including rising living costs, economic development, and healthcare shortages.\n\nFranz, with a strong background in public lands and housing, advocates for increased housing production, support for workers' rights, and enhanced Medicare benefits. Randall emphasizes economic policies that support the middle class, clean energy investments, and expanding healthcare access. MacEwen focuses on reducing government spending, enhancing infrastructure, and addressing healthcare facility closures. Ralston, as an independent, stresses curbing inflation and expanding healthcare infrastructure while leveraging the district's natural beauty to boost the economy.8th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep Kim Schrier (D) is facing competition from both the left and right as she looks to retain Washington's 8th congressional district. Imraan Siddiqi (D), the executive director of the Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is critical of Schrier's response to the Gaza crisis. Meanwhile Republican Carmen Goers. a commercial banker and former military spouse, focuses on issues like inflation, mental health care, and rural health care access.\n\nSchrier, the district's first Democrat representative, emphasizes her bipartisan track record and commitment to healthcare and abortion rights. As the primary approaches, the more moderate incumbent hopes that a significant fundraising advantage will propel her to the finish line.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Here are some of the key congressional races to watch in each state.\n\nKansas: U.S. House seats\n\n2nd Congressional District\n\nFive Republicans and two Democrats are running in Kansas' 2nd Congressional District after two-term U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner, R-KS announced he would not seek reelection in April.The leading GOP candidates in a solidly conservative seat are former state attorney general Derek Schmidt, former LaTurner aide Jeff Kahrs, rancher Shawn Tiffany, veteran Michael Ogle, and Chad Young. Schmidt and Kahrs lead the others in campaign contributions, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Nancy Boyda and former University of Kansas basketball player Matt Kleinmann face off in the Democratic primary.\n\nKansas's 2nd Congressional District leans Republican, voting for former President Donald Trump by over 55% in 2016 and 2020.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nIn Kansas' 3rd Congressional District, Republican physician Prasanth Reddy and small business owner Karen Crnkovich are facing off to challenge the state's lone Democratic member of Congress, Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kans. Reddy currently leads Crnkovich in fundraising.\n\nThe swing district, which is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area, went for Trump in 2016 but for President Joe Biden in 2020. Davids has served for three terms and won reelection in 2022 with 55% of the vote.\n\nMichigan: U.S. Senate seat\n\nThere's a rare opening for a U.S. Senate seat after Sen. Debbie Stabenow announced her retirement and a crowded field has sprung up to fill it.\n\nMore: Here's a breakdown on Michigan's big congressional races in '24\n\nTwo Democrats and four Republicans are battling it out in the primary for their party's nomination.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hill Harper, businessman, author, and probably most recognized for his acting roles in T.V. shows like \"The Good Doctor\" and \"CSI: N.Y.,\" is running against first-term U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence official and acting assistant secretary in the Defense Department who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District. Slotkin is expected to win.\n\nThe Republican primary is leading with former Rep. Mike Rogers against ex-Congressman Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell, a former congressional candidate.\n\nMichigan: U.S. House races\n\nDemocrats currently hold the majority of Michigan's congressional delegation, 7-6, but seats are up for grabs in several districts that could decide control of the U.S. House.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Republicans Paul Hudson and Michael Markey are running for the chance to challenge incumbent Democratic first-term U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who has her own primary challenger in Salim Al-Shatel but is favored to win.\n\nIn the 8th District, U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., is stepping down from Congress this year after six terms. Three Democrats and three Republicans are running in their respective primaries.\n\nIn the 10th District, Democrat Carl Marlinga, Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley, and Diane Young are vying for the Democratic nomination against Republican Rep. John James. James barely beat out Marlinga in this race two years ago.\n\nMissouri: U.S. House seats\n\nDemocratic incumbent Rep. Cori Bush is expected to have a run for her money against St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell in the party's primary for Missouri's 1st District.\n\nBell, who has backing from pro-Israel groups, is attacking Bush, who is being framed as a partisan disruption to Democratic cooperation in the House. A member of \"The Squad\" made up of progressive congressional Democrats, if Bush falls short of votes, she would be the second ouster following New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman's stunning upset in June.\n\nTwo other Democrats, Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Ron Harshaw, will also appear on the Democratic ballot. Five candidates are on the Republican primary ballot.\n\nWashington\n\nLeft-leaning Washington state will see contested primaries for its fifth and sixth congressional districts as the current representatives in each, GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Democrat Rep. Derek Kilmer, respectively, are retiring.\n\nIn the 8th District, centrist Democrat Rep. Kim Schrier faces disruption from a new candidate focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Meanwhile, in the 3rd District, Trump-endorsed Joe Kent is looking to unseat Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in what appears to be a tightly contested race.\n\nWashington has a nonpartisan primary system in which all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of party, and the top two finishers in the race advance to the general election.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nTwo years ago, Democrat Gluesenkamp Perez pulled off a major upset by winning a congressional seat against Trump-backed candidate Joe Kent in a district that hadn't voted Democratic in over a decade. Now, with Trump's endorsement again, Kent is back to reclaim the seat in Washington's southwest corner. However, he faces strong competition from former King County Prosecutor Leslie Lewallen, who has raised $820,000 compared to Kent's nearly $1.4 million. Lewallen focuses on crime and homelessness, criticizing both Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent for being too extreme.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez has outpaced her challengers with $6.7 million in fundraising. She supports abortion access and climate change policies while advocating for increased border security to combat the fentanyl crisis. Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for President Biden's impeachment, accuses Gluesenkamp Perez of pretending to be a moderate.\n\n4th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse faces Trump-endorsed Jerrod Sessler and former nurse Tiffany Smiley in Washington's reddest congressional district, spanning from the Canadian border to the Columbia River. Newhouse, one of the few Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, focuses on agriculture and border security, key issues for a district reliant on immigrant labor.\n\nSessler, a Navy veteran and ex-NASCAR driver, proudly embraces Trump's endorsement, while Smiley criticizes Newhouse's stance on Trump. Newhouse has raised $1.6 million, outpacing Smiley and Sessler combined.\n\n5th Congressional District\n\nTen candidates are battling to succeed McMorris Rogers, who has served in Congress for two decades, in the Fifth District, a Republican-leaning district encompassing the eastern third of the state and Spokane.\n\nSix Republicans and four Democrats are competing for the top two spots to advance to the November ballot. (A fifth Democrat, Bobbi Bennett-Wolcott, will also appear on the ballot despite dropping out in July.) Republican Spokane Country treasurer and former state Sen. Michael Baumgartner is the race's top fundraiser, while OBGYN Dr. Bernadine Bank holds a slight lead over the Democratic candidates in campaign contributions.\n\n6th Congressional District\n\nIn Washington's Sixth Congressional District, 5 candidates are vying to replace retiring Rep. Derek Kilmer (D). This includes state senators Emily Randall (D) and Drew MacEwen (R), Washington Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz (D), and independent Graham Ralston. Each one brings a different perspective on addressing the district's challenges, including rising living costs, economic development, and healthcare shortages.\n\nFranz, with a strong background in public lands and housing, advocates for increased housing production, support for workers' rights, and enhanced Medicare benefits. Randall emphasizes economic policies that support the middle class, clean energy investments, and expanding healthcare access. MacEwen focuses on reducing government spending, enhancing infrastructure, and addressing healthcare facility closures. Ralston, as an independent, stresses curbing inflation and expanding healthcare infrastructure while leveraging the district's natural beauty to boost the economy.8th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep Kim Schrier (D) is facing competition from both the left and right as she looks to retain Washington's 8th congressional district. Imraan Siddiqi (D), the executive director of the Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is critical of Schrier's response to the Gaza crisis. Meanwhile Republican Carmen Goers. a commercial banker and former military spouse, focuses on issues like inflation, mental health care, and rural health care access.\n\nSchrier, the district's first Democrat representative, emphasizes her bipartisan track record and commitment to healthcare and abortion rights. As the primary approaches, the more moderate incumbent hopes that a significant fundraising advantage will propel her to the finish line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on St. Cloud Times: Key

Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence official and acting assistant secretary in the Defense Department who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District. Slotkin is expected to win.\n\nThe Republican primary is leading with former Rep. Mike Rogers against ex-Congressman Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell, a former congressional candidate.\n\nDemocrats currently hold the majority of Michigan's congressional delegation, 7-6, but seats are up for grabs in several districts that could decide control of the U.S. House.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Republicans Paul Hudson and Michael Markey are running for the chance to challenge incumbent Democratic first-term U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who has her own primary challenger in Salim Al-Shatel but is favored to win.\n\nIn the 8th District, U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., is stepping down from Congress this year after six terms. Three Democrats and three Republicans are running in their respective primaries.\n\nIn the 10th District, Democrat Carl Marlinga, Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley, and Diane Young are vying for the Democratic nomination against Republican Rep. John James. James barely beat out Marlinga in this race two years ago.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Rep. Cori Bush is expected to have a run for her money against St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell in the party's primary for Missouri's 1st District.\n\nBell, who has backing from pro-Israel groups, is attacking Bush, who is being framed as a partisan disruption to Democratic cooperation in the House. A member of \"The Squad\" made up of progressive congressional Democrats, if Bush falls short of votes, she would be the second ouster following New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman's stunning upset in June.\n\nTwo other Democrats, Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Ron Harshaw, will also appear on the Democratic ballot. Five candidates are on the Republican primary ballot.\n\nLeft-leaning Washington state will see contested primaries for its fifth and sixth congressional districts as the current representatives in each, GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Democrat Rep. Derek Kilmer, respectively, are retiring.\n\nIn the 8th District, centrist Democrat Rep. Kim Schrier faces disruption from a new candidate focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Meanwhile, in the 3rd District, Trump-endorsed Joe Kent is looking to unseat Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in what appears to be a tightly contested race.\n\nWashington has a nonpartisan primary system in which all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of party, and the top two finishers in the race advance to the general election.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nTwo years ago, Democrat Gluesenkamp Perez pulled off a major upset by winning a congressional seat against Trump-backed candidate Joe Kent in a district that hadn't voted Democratic in over a decade. Now, with Trump's endorsement again, Kent is back to reclaim the seat in Washington's southwest corner. However, he faces strong competition from former King County Prosecutor Leslie Lewallen, who has raised $820,000 compared to Kent's nearly $1.4 million. Lewallen focuses on crime and homelessness, criticizing both Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent for being too extreme.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez has outpaced her challengers with $6.7 million in fundraising. She supports abortion access and climate change policies while advocating for increased border security to combat the fentanyl crisis. Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for President Biden's impeachment, accuses Gluesenkamp Perez of pretending to be a moderate.\n\n4th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse faces Trump-endorsed Jerrod Sessler and former nurse Tiffany Smiley in Washington's reddest congressional district, spanning from the Canadian border to the Columbia River. Newhouse, one of the few Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, focuses on agriculture and border security, key issues for a district reliant on immigrant labor.\n\nSessler, a Navy veteran and ex-NASCAR driver, proudly embraces Trump's endorsement, while Smiley criticizes Newhouse's stance on Trump. Newhouse has raised $1.6 million, outpacing Smiley and Sessler combined.\n\nTen candidates are battling to succeed McMorris Rogers, who has served in Congress for two decades, in the Fifth District, a Republican-leaning district encompassing the eastern third of the state and Spokane.\n\nSix Republicans and four Democrats are competing for the top two spots to advance to the November ballot. (A fifth Democrat, Bobbi Bennett-Wolcott, will also appear on the ballot despite dropping out in July.) Republican Spokane Country treasurer and former state Sen. Michael Baumgartner is the race's top fundraiser, while OBGYN Dr. Bernadine Bank holds a slight lead over the Democratic candidates in campaign contributions.\n\nIn Washington's Sixth Congressional District, 5 candidates are vying to replace retiring Rep. Derek Kilmer (D). This includes state senators Emily Randall (D) and Drew MacEwen (R), Washington Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz (D), and independent Graham Ralston. Each one brings a different perspective on addressing the district's challenges, including rising living costs, economic development, and healthcare shortages.\n\nFranz, with a strong background in public lands and housing, advocates for increased housing production, support for workers' rights, and enhanced Medicare benefits. Randall emphasizes economic policies that support the middle class, clean energy investments, and expanding healthcare access. MacEwen focuses on reducing government spending, enhancing infrastructure, and addressing healthcare facility closures. Ralston, as an independent, stresses curbing inflation and expanding healthcare infrastructure while leveraging the district's natural beauty to boost the economy.8th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep Kim Schrier (D) is facing competition from both the left and right as she looks to retain Washington's 8th congressional district. Imraan Siddiqi (D), the executive director of the Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is critical of Schrier's response to the Gaza crisis. Meanwhile Republican Carmen Goers. a commercial banker and former military spouse, focuses on issues like inflation, mental health care, and rural health care access.\n\nSchrier, the district's first Democrat representative, emphasizes her bipartisan track record and commitment to healthcare and abortion rights. As the primary approaches, the more moderate incumbent hopes that a significant fundraising advantage will propel her to the finish line.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) - Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers has secured the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Michigan and will face Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the November election. Slotkin and Rogers, long considered the front-runners for their respective party nominations, will now shift focus to the general election. Slotkin enters with a massive fundraising advantage and emerges nearly unscathed from a sparse primary, while Rogers has the backing of national Republican groups and former President Donald Trump. Slotkin defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic primary, while Republicans chose Rogers over former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell. Both candidates will now compete for a seat left open by longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan voters on Tuesday will decide which Republican and Democratic candidates will compete in November for the state's highly coveted open U.S. Senate seat, in addition to several of the nation's most competitive U.S. House races. Many Democrats have coalesced around U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the Senate race while Republicans have united behind former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who received an endorsement from Donald Trump earlier this year. Both candidates are vying for a seat left open by longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement, but they must first defeat underdog challengers on Tuesday. Slotkin is up against actor Hill Harper, while Republicans will choose between Rogers, former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell. Although businessman Sandy Pensler dropped out and endorsed Rogers at a July 20 rally with Trump, his name will still appear on the ballot due to his late withdrawal. With Democrats holding a razor-thin majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House, competitive races like those in Michigan are drawing lots of attention. The state's status as a key presidential swing state raises the stakes for those seats even higher, with party control on the line from the top of the ballot all the way down to the state Legislature. Michigan's open Senate seat is one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine control of the upper chamber in November. With a later congressional primary, candidates will have a short period to transition from competing against their own party members to appealing to a broader base of voters for the Nov. 5 general election, which may explain why Slotkin and Rogers have campaigned with their eyes on the general election. National groups on both sides have already reserved millions for advertisements after the primary. Both Slotkin and Rogers, viewed for months as the overwhelming favorites in their primaries, have skipped debates and refrained from holding large campaign events. Several U.S. House seats with primaries on Tuesday could influence the balance of power in the lower chamber, but there, too, the biggest battles will be fought in the fall campaign. Slotkin's entry into the Senate race has left her mid-Michigan 7th Congressional District seat open, historically one of the nation's top battleground districts. Both party candidates are running unopposed in their primaries there, setting the table for a November matchup between Democrat Curtis Hertel Jr. and Republican Tom Barrett. The 8th Congressional District is also an open race with U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee's retirement. The Democratic congressman has endorsed state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet to take his place, but state Board of Education President Pamela Pugh and Matt Collier, the former mayor of Flint, are also vying for the party's nomination. On the Republican side, former TV anchor Paul Junge is making another bid after losing to Kildee by over 10 percentage points last year. Joining him in the race are Mary Draves, a former chemical manufacturing executive at Dow Inc., and Anthony Hudson. Meanwhile, several incumbents in battleground seats are waiting to see who they will face in November. U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who in 2022 became the first Democrat to represent Grand Rapids in decades, is awaiting the outcome of the Republican primary between attorney Paul Hudson and businessman Michael Markey Jr. in the western Michigan district. National Democrats are also hoping to flip a district just north of Detroit currently held by freshman GOP Rep. John James. Carl Marlinga, a longtime Macomb County prosecutor who lost to James in 2022 by 1,600 votes, is facing Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley and Diane Young in the Democratic primary. In a heavily Democratic district encompassing downtown Detroit, U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar faces a challenge from Detroit City Council member Mary Waters, who is endorsed by Mayor Mike Duggan. Thanedar has significantly outraised her and is favored to win the Democratic nomination, which would likely leave Detroit - a city that is nearly 80% Black - without Black representation in Congress for a second consecutive term. Down-ballot races are holding primaries across the state on Tuesday. Control of the state House of Representatives will be at stake in November, with all 110 seats up for election. Democrats took control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in four decades in 2022 and will be trying to defend those majorities. ___ Associated Press writer Isabella Volmert

Cori Bush's Democratic primary in Missouri is one of the most expensive and hotly contested races Tuesday, when voters in four states (Missouri, Washington, Michigan and Kansas) choose their party's candidates in congressional and state races.\n\nFour years after ousting longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in the heavily Democratic 1st District, Bush is seeking to win an election that has exposed the party's divisions over Israel.\n\nShe faced a barrage of attacks from the United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group. The super PAC also spent millions to defeat another member of the team, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., in a June primary.\n\nSquad Member Cori Bush Prepares for Democratic Primary, Putting Israel in Spotlight\n\nRep. Cori Bush faces a tough primary in her fight for a third term. Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nThe pro-Israel super PAC also worked to support Bush's opponent, St. Louis County District Attorney Wesley Bell, who was originally running for Senate but decided to go after Bush weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nAnd Bush isn't the only House member weighing in on the defense issue Tuesday.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., is once again seeking to advance in a primary after drawing Trump's ire for voting to impeach him following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nAlong with California Rep. David Valadao, Newhouse is one of two pro-impeachment Republicans still serving in the House. The other eight Republicans have either retired or lost primaries to Trump-backed opponents two years ago.\n\nValadao and Newhouse benefited from their state's two-candidate primary system, in which all candidates run on the same primary ballot and the two candidates with the most votes advance to November, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nTrump had initially backed Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler in the race against Newhouse. But on Sunday, he also voiced support for former nurse Tiffany Smiley, who outspent the rest of the candidates on the airwaves, according to ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Smiley also received support from a super PAC that supports her. Meanwhile, America Leads Inc., a group that has backed two other Republican lawmakers heading into primaries, spent money on ads to support Newhouse.\n\nA third House member, Democrat Shri Thanedar, is in a defensive position in his primary in Michigan's 13th District. He faces two intraparty opponents vying for the seat he has held for nearly two years: Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters, who was endorsed by Mayor Mike Duggan, and attorney Shakira Lynn Hawkins.\n\nMichigan battles take shapeDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers are on a collision course in the Michigan Senate race.AP; Getty\n\nTuesday's primaries will also determine the matchups in a series of competitive races in Michigan, a swing state in presidential elections that is also home to one of the most important Senate races of the year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is not seeking a fifth term, and both parties have lined up candidates to succeed her.\n\nTrump has endorsed former Rep. Mike Rogers, who was once a vocal critic of him. But Rogers is seen as one of the National Republican Senatorial Committee's big recruitment victories, giving the GOP a candidate with a track record of electoral success and appeal to independent voters.\n\nOther potential contenders, including former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, former Rep. Peter Meijer and wealthy businessman Sandy Pensler, have all ended their campaigns. That leaves former Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party in 2019 after becoming disenchanted and scared off by the GOP, as Rogers' main challenger.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is considered the party's frontrunner, given her support from top party leaders and labor organizations. She faces a challenge from Hill Harper, a political newcomer and actor best known for his work on ABC's The Good Doctor.\n\nTuesday's primaries will also determine matchups in a number of competitive House races, including several in Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan's 3rd District, Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten faces multiple challenges for the seat she has held for nearly two years.\n\nScholten has the advantage of being an incumbent over Democratic challenger Salim Al-Shatel, a former small business owner, former substitute teacher and real estate agent who graduated from Michigan State University in 2015.\n\nOn the Republican side, attorney Paul Hudson and financial adviser Michael Markey are vying to take on the Democratic winner in November. So far, Trump has not commented on the Republican primary race.\n\nScholten defeated Republican John Gibbs by nearly 13 percentage points in the 2022 general election, flipping the seat in favor of Democrats.\n\nOn July 11, Scholten notably joined the chorus of congressional Democrats calling on President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, praising his leadership while encouraging him to pass the torch. She has since participated in a surrogate event for Vice President Kamala Harris in Grand Rapids late last month.\n\nThe 3rd District, in western Michigan, includes most of the Grand Rapids area and is home to Kent County, which leaned toward Biden by about 6 points in 2020. (Biden won the statewide by less than 3 points.)\n\nThere are also competitive primaries on both sides in Michigan's 8th Congressional District, where Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat, is not seeking reelection.\n\nRepublican candidates include Paul Junge, a former criminal prosecutor and news anchor who served in the Trump administration and has Trump's endorsement; Mary Draves, a former Dow Chemical executive; and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver. Former Flint Mayor Matt Collier, state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet and state Board of Education Chairwoman Pamela Pugh are running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nGeneral elections are considered child's play there.\n\nThe contest will also be in Michigan's 7th Congressional District, a hotly contested district to replace Slotkin. The parties have coalesced around two former state senators: Republican Tom Barrett, who lost a close race to Slotkin two years ago, and Democrat Curtis Hertel.\n\nMore Trump Tests\n\nTrump's approval will be tested in a handful of other elections on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has endorsed several candidates in the Missouri gubernatorial race, backing three of the leading Republican contenders: Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nWith the state leaning right, the winner of the Republican primary is likely to win the governor's race in November. Tuesday's primary will also determine the matchup in the state's Senate race, with Marine veteran Lucas Kunce making a second run against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley after losing the 2022 Democratic primary.\n\nFurther down the ballot, Trump endorsed former state Sen. Bob Onder to replace retiring Republican Rep. Blaine Leutkemeyer in the deeply red 3rd District.\n\nThe primaries attracted millions of dollars in outside funding. The Club for Growth Action, a conservative party, endorsed Onder, while two establishment groups active in other Republican primaries, Conservatives for American Excellence and America Leads Action Inc., ran ads attacking him.\n\nBut in Kansas's solidly Republican 2nd District, Trump and Conservatives for American Excellence are on the same side in Tuesday's primary to replace retiring Republican Rep. Jake LaTurner. Both are backing former state Attorney General Derek Schmidt.\n\nKansas Republicans will also choose a candidate to face Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids in the more competitive 3rd District, which Trump has not ruled on.\n\nTrump took sides in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, where Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is a top Republican target as one of five Democrats representing a district Trump won in 2020. He has endorsed controversial Army veteran Joe Kent.\n\nKent lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by less than a percentage point in 2022 as he faced allegations about his ties to extremist groups. Kent will face Camas City Councilmember Leslie Lewallen in the primary. She argued that Kent would lose again if he were the GOP nominee.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern Time in Michigan and Missouri and at 9 p.m. Eastern Time in Kansas. Washington elections are conducted entirely by mail, and ballots must be postmarked by Election Day or placed in drop boxes by 11 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car

(AP) -- Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers has secured the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Michigan and will face Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the November election.\n\nSlotkin and Rogers, long considered the front-runners for their respective party nominations, will now shift focus to the general election. Slotkin enters with a massive fundraising advantage and emerges nearly unscathed from a sparse primary, while Rogers has the backing of national Republican groups and former President Donald Trump.\n\nSlotkin defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic primary, while Republicans chose Rogers over former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell. Both candidates will now compete for a seat left open by longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan voters on Tuesday will decide which Republican and Democratic candidates will compete in November for the state's highly coveted open U.S. Senate seat, in addition to several of the nation's most competitive U.S. House races.\n\nMany Democrats have coalesced around U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the Senate race while Republicans have united behind former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who received an endorsement from Donald Trump earlier this year. Both candidates are vying for a seat left open by longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement, but they must first defeat underdog challengers on Tuesday.\n\nSlotkin is up against actor Hill Harper, while Republicans will choose between Rogers, former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell. Although businessman Sandy Pensler dropped out and endorsed Rogers at a July 20 rally with Trump, his name will still appear on the ballot due to his late withdrawal.\n\nWith Democrats holding a razor-thin majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House, competitive races like those in Michigan are drawing lots of attention. The state's status as a key presidential swing state raises the stakes for those seats even higher, with party control on the line from the top of the ballot all the way down to the state Legislature.\n\nMichigan's open Senate seat is one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine control of the upper chamber in November. With a later congressional primary, candidates will have a short period to transition from competing against their own party members to appealing to a broader base of voters for the Nov. 5 general election, which may explain why Slotkin and Rogers have campaigned with their eyes on the general election.\n\nNational groups on both sides have already reserved millions for advertisements after the primary. Both Slotkin and Rogers, viewed for months as the overwhelming favorites in their primaries, have skipped debates and refrained from holding large campaign events.\n\nSeveral U.S. House seats with primaries on Tuesday could influence the balance of power in the lower chamber, but there, too, the biggest battles will be fought in the fall campaign.\n\nSlotkin's entry into the Senate race has left her mid-Michigan 7th Congressional District seat open, historically one of the nation's top battleground districts. Both party candidates are running unopposed in their primaries there, setting the table for a November matchup between Democrat Curtis Hertel Jr. and Republican Tom Barrett.\n\nThe 8th Congressional District is also an open race with U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee's retirement. The Democratic congressman has endorsed state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet to take his place, but state Board of Education President Pamela Pugh and Matt Collier, the former mayor of Flint, are also vying for the party's nomination.\n\nOn the Republican side, former TV anchor Paul Junge is making another bid after losing to Kildee by over 10 percentage points last year. Joining him in the race are Mary Draves, a former chemical manufacturing executive at Dow Inc., and Anthony Hudson.\n\nMeanwhile, several incumbents in battleground seats are waiting to see who they will face in November.\n\nU.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who in 2022 became the first Democrat to represent Grand Rapids in decades, is awaiting the outcome of the Republican primary between attorney Paul Hudson and businessman Michael Markey Jr. in the western Michigan district.\n\nNational Democrats are also hoping to flip a district just north of Detroit currently held by freshman GOP Rep. John James. Carl Marlinga, a longtime Macomb County prosecutor who lost to James in 2022 by 1,600 votes, is facing Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley and Diane Young in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn a heavily Democratic district encompassing downtown Detroit, U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar faces a challenge from Detroit City Council member Mary Waters, who is endorsed by Mayor Mike Duggan. Thanedar has significantly outraised her and is favored to win the Democratic nomination, which would likely leave Detroit -- a city that is nearly 80% Black -- without Black representation in Congress for a second consecutive term.\n\nDown-ballot races are holding primaries across the state on Tuesday. Control of the state House of Representatives will be at stake in November, with all 110 seats up for election. Democrats took control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in four decades in 2022 and will be trying to defend those majorities.\n\nAssociated Press writer Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Debbie Stabenow. The seat is one of a handful in key battleground states that the GOP is aiming to flip as it works to win back control of the Senate it lost in the 2020 elections.\n\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers, a one-time FBI special agent who later served as chair of the House Intelligence Committee during his tenure in Congress, enjoys the backing of former President Trump, the GOP's presidential nominee, as well as support from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is the Senate GOP's campaign arm.\n\nWHAT MIKE ROGERS TOLD FOX NEWS DIGITAL ABOUT HIS SENATE SHOWDOWN IN MICHIGAN\n\nRogers is considered the clear front-runner in a field that also includes former Rep. Justin Amash, and physician Sherry O'Donnell.\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin is the clear front-runner for the Democratic Party's Senate nomination in a race that also includes actor and Detroit small business owner Hill Harper.\n\nIn the race to succeed Slotkin in the Lansing-area swing seat in Michigan's 7th Congressional District are Democrat Curtis Hertel and Republican Tom Barrett, two former state senators who are uncontested as they seek their party's nominations.\n\nOther Michigan congressional seats that could decide control of the U.S. House - where Republicans currently hold a razor-thin majority - are in the 3rd, 8th and 10th districts, all of which have contested primaries on Tuesday.\n\nIn Missouri, conservative Sen. Josh Hawley is unopposed in the GOP primary as he runs for re-election. The winner of the Democratic primary, which includes 2022 nominee Lucas Kunce, will face a steep uphill climb against Hawley in November.\n\nBut the primary in Missouri that's grabbing plenty of national attention is the Democrati nomination battle in the St. Louis-area 1st Congressional District. That's where Rep. Cori Bush, a member of the so-called \"Squad\" of diverse progressives, is facing a challenge from St. Louis county prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell in a primary that's seen more than $15 million in outside spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA key issue in the race is Bush's criticism of how Israel is handling its war against Hamas in the densely populated Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, in the GOP nomination race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Mike Parson, Trump has endorsed three of the nine candidates in the primary field: Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Mike Kehoe and Air Force veteran and state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrats and Republicans are holding primaries in the race to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Jake LaTurner in the 2nd Congressional District, which covers much of the eastern part of the state, including parts of metropolitan Kansas City.\n\nIn the overwhelmingly urban 3rd Congressional District, two Republicans are vying to challenge three-term Rep. Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in the Kansas congressional delegation.\n\nIn Washington state, Democrat Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is running for re-election to a second term in a seat she flipped blue two years ago. She goes before voters in an all-party primary that also includes Republican Joe Kent, the Trump supporter she defeated in 2022. In Washington, the top two vote getters in the primary face off in November.\n\nThere are also primaries in the races to succeed retiring Democrat Rep. Derek Kilmer and Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n\nIn the race for governor, nearly 30 candidates are vying to succeed retiring three-term Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_steinhauser@foxnews.com", "name": "Paul Steinhauser", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Gretchen Whitmer, who largely took herself out of the race by last week, or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a Traverse City resident, who gets the spot.\n\nHarris and her vice presidential nominee will then begin a swing through battleground states in Philadelphia, before visiting Michigan on Wednesday and Thursday for events that have not yet been made public but will no doubt command lots of attention.\n\nThen there's also Monday's big stock sell-off globally and whether it portends a temporary slow down or a potential recession, as some fear.\n\nIt's been a recurring theme this election year, national news overtaking local political races, but here are three things to keep an eye on as the returns start to come in on Tuesday night, after polls close at 8 p.m.\n\nHow do the U.S. Senate races shake out?\n\nThe open U.S. Senate seat in Michigan, being vacated by Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow after four six-year terms, is the big statewide contest being voted on in November (other than the presidency, which Michigan will help decide with a handful of other swing states). No Republican has won a U.S. Senate race in Michigan in 30 years, but it's considered a close call this year, depending on how circumstances play out.\n\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, has long been considered the frontrunner for her party's nomination, having a considerable advantage in fundraising and political experience over her competition. But Detroit actor Hill Harper has been working hard to try to close the gap with Slotkin and was closing out the primary Monday night with a virtual get-out-the-vote rally with rappers Ludacris and Akon.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic nomination, he or she was set to face one of three Republicans: Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of Brighton, former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash of Cascade Charter Township or west Michigan Dr. Sherry O'Donnell. Rogers is considered the likely nominee, having the support of institutional Republicans and former President (and current GOP nominee) Donald Trump. If it were to be other than a Slotkin-Rogers matchup, it would spell a major upset but how the votes shake out could tell us a lot about just how engaged voters are in this race and if the favorites are as strong as they seem.\n\nWhat about those toss-up U.S. House races?\n\nThere are three, maybe four, races among Michigan's 13 U.S. House seats that could be considered toss-ups, only two of which have incumbents - one Republican, one Democrat - running for reelection.\n\nTuesday's voting, once we have the results, will give us a better idea of how the fall races will shake out.\n\nIn Michigan's 10th Congressional District, centered on southern Macomb County and eastern Oakland County, U.S. Rep. John James, R-Shelby Township, is running unopposed for a nomination to a second two-year term. But after winning by a slim margin in 2022, he (and we) will have to wait to see if he again faces former Macomb County Judge Carl Marlinga or one of the other Democrats: Emily Busch of Oxford, Diane Young of Warren or state Board of Education member Tiffany Tilley of West Bloomfield.\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, faces Salim Al-Shatel, a west Michigan businessman in her reelection primary. If she were to somehow lose, it would be a major upset. The Democratic winner will face either Paul Hudson, an East Grand Rapids lawyer, or Grand Haven financial planner Michael Markey, who are running for the GOP nomination in this marginally Democratic district.\n\nThen there are the two open U.S. House seats.\n\nIn the 8th Congressional District, a tossup seat was put up for grabs by the surprise announcement of U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, that he would not run for reelection in the district that includes Bay City, Flint and Saginaw. Running for the Republican nomination are Paul Junge, of Grand Blanc, who lost to Kildee two years ago but has Trump's endorsement; Mary Draves, of Midland, a former Dow Chemical executive; and Anthony Hudson, a small businessman from Grand Blanc. Meanwhile, state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City is running for the Democratic nod with Kildee's endorsement. She faces Pamela Pugh, of Saginaw, who is the president of the state Board of Education, and former Flint Mayor Matt Collier. However this race turns out, expect lots of attention and outside money to be showered on it in the fall.\n\nThe other tossup race is in mid-Michigan's 7th Congressional District and we already know the nomination winners there because both were unopposed Tuesday: former state Sen. Tom Barrett of Charlotte, in the Republican primary, and former state Sen. Curtis Hertel of Lansing, in the Democratic primary. They'll face each other in November for the seat Slotkin (see U.S. Senate race above) is relinquishing.\n\nWhat are the other factors at play?\n\nSince Michigan adopted no-reason absentee voting in 2018, turnout has generally been up (substantially so in some elections) and the restrictions on early voting that were loosened ahead of this year's balloting could further help that. But for much of this election, enthusiasm has appeared to be down among voters, especially those who weren't overwhelmed by the fact that it appeared President Joe Biden and Trump would face each other in this year's presidential election.\n\nSince Biden stepped aside for Harris as the Democratic nominee late last month, however, Democrats have felt a surge in enthusiasm and the primary - not to mention Harris' impending visit - could be indicators of just how much energy there is. They could also help determine if Republicans embrace absentee voting after Trump bashing it as inherently corrupt four years ago (even if he has changed his tune somewhat this year). For anyone who does plan to vote in person at the polls on Tuesday, there is expected to be rain across much of Michigan, which could potentially reduce turnout. We'll certainly be keeping an eye out for any oddities, problems or trends.\n\nPolls will open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. (though remember there are four counties in the western Upper Peninsula in the Central time zone). It's anyone's guess how long it will take to get winners called in the races: Because absentee votes can't be counted early, it often takes hours - if not into the next morning or longer - to get the unofficial results completed.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gomez and Jillian Frankel and Julie Tsirkin and Kyle Stewart and Wil Courtney\n\nAugust 6, 2024 at 11:00 AM\n\nAnother member of the \"squad\" of progressive lawmakers is fighting for political survival in Tuesday's primaries, which will also put former President Donald Trump's endorsement to the test once again, including in Michigan's crucial battleground Senate race.\n\nRep. Cori Bush's Democratic primary in Missouri is among the most expensive and hotly contested races Tuesday, when voters in four states -- Missouri, Washington, Michigan and Kansas -- pick their parties' nominees in congressional and state races.\n\nFour years after she ousted longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in the heavily Democratic 1st District, Bush is looking to win a race that has exposed the party's divisions over Israel.\n\nShe has faced an onslaught of attacks from United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group. The super PAC also spent millions to defeat a fellow \"squad\" member, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., in a June primary.\n\n'Squad' member Cori Bush faces Democratic primary putting a spotlight on Israel\n\nThe pro-Israel super PAC has also worked to boost Bush's challenger, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell, who was initially running for the Senate but decided to take on Bush a few weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nAnd Bush isn't the only House member on defense Tuesday.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., is once again looking to advance through a primary after he drew Trump's ire for voting to impeach him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nAlong with Rep. David Valadao of California, Newhouse is one of two pro-impeachment House Republicans still in office. The eight other Republicans either retired or lost to Trump-backed primary challengers two years ago.\n\nValadao and Newhouse have benefited from their states' top-two primary systems, in which all candidates compete on the same primary ballot and the top two vote-getters advance to November, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nTrump initially endorsed Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler in the race against Newhouse. But on Sunday, he also voiced support for former nurse Tiffany Smiley, who has outspent the rest of the field on the airwaves, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Smiley has also gotten a boost from a supportive super PAC. Meanwhile, America Leads Inc., a group that has backed two other GOP lawmakers facing primaries, has spent on ads to bolster Newhouse.\n\nA third House member -- Democrat Shri Thanedar -- is on defense in his primary in Michigan's 13th District. He faces two intraparty challengers vying for the seat he has held for nearly two years: Detroit City Council member Mary Waters, who has been endorsed by Mayor Mike Duggan, and attorney Shakira Lynn Hawkins.\n\nMichigan battles take shape\n\nTuesday's primaries will also set the matchups in a slew of competitive races in Michigan, a swing state in presidential elections, which is also home to one of the top Senate races of the year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is not seeking a fifth term, and both party establishments have rallied around candidates to succeed her.\n\nTrump has endorsed former Rep. Mike Rogers, who had once been a strident critic of his. But Rogers is seen as one of the National Republican Senatorial Committee's big recruiting victories of the cycle, giving the GOP a candidate with a history of electoral success and appeal to independent voters.\n\nOther potentially strong contenders, including former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, former Rep. Peter Meijer and wealthy businessman Sandy Pensler, all ended their campaigns. That leaves former Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party in 2019 after having grown \"disenchanted\" and \"frightened\" by the GOP, as Rogers' top competition.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is seen as the party's front-runner, given her support from key party leaders and labor organizations. She faces a challenge from Hill Harper, a political newcomer and actor known for his work on the ABC series \"The Good Doctor.\"\n\nTuesday's primaries will also set the matchup in a number of competitive House races, including multiple ones in Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan's 3rd District, Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten faces multiple challenges to the seat she has held for nearly two years.\n\nScholten has the benefit of incumbency against Democratic challenger Salim Al-Shatel, a former small-business owner, former substitute teacher and real estate agent who graduated from Michigan State University in 2015.\n\nOn the GOP side, attorney Paul Hudson and financial adviser Michael Markey are competing to face off against the Democratic winner in November. So far, Trump has not weighed in on the Republican primary race.\n\nScholten defeated Republican John Gibbs by nearly 13 percentage points in the 2022 general election, flipping the seat for Democrats.\n\nNotably, on July 11, Scholten joined the chorus of congressional Democrats who called for President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, praising his leadership while encouraging him to pass the torch. She has since participated in a surrogate event for Vice President Kamala Harris in Grand Rapids late last month.\n\nThe 3rd District, in western Michigan, includes most of the Grand Rapids area and is home to battleground Kent County, which swung for Biden by about 6 points in 2020. (Biden won the entire state by less than 3 points.)\n\nThere are also competitive primaries on both sides in Michigan's 8th Congressional District, where Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election.\n\nRepublican contenders include Paul Junge, a former criminal prosecutor and TV news anchor who served in the Trump administration and has Trump's endorsement; Mary Draves, a former Dow Chemical executive; and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver. Former Flint Mayor Matt Collier, state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet and State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh are running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe general election there is seen as a tossup.\n\nThe matchup will also be set in Michigan's competitive 7th District to replace Slotkin. The parties have coalesced around two former state senators: Republican Tom Barrett, who lost a close race to Slotkin two years ago, and Democrat Curtis Hertel.\n\nMore Trump tests\n\nTrump's endorsement will be put to the test in a handful of other races Tuesday.\n\nTrump endorsed multiple candidates in the Missouri governor's race, backing three of the top Republican contenders: Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nWith the state trending to the right, the winner of the GOP primary is expected to win the governor's race in November. Tuesday's primary will also set the matchup in the state's Senate race, with Marine veteran Lucas Kunce making another run against GOP Sen. Josh Hawley after he lost the 2022 Democratic primary.\n\nFurther down the ballot, Trump has backed former state Sen. Bob Onder to replace retiring GOP Rep. Blaine Leutkemeyer in the deep-red 3rd District.\n\nThe primary has attracted millions of dollars in outside spending. The conservative Club for Growth Action has backed Onder, while two establishment groups active in other GOP primaries, Conservatives for American Excellence and America Leads Action Inc., have launched ads attacking him.\n\nBut in Kansas' solidly Republican 2nd District, Trump and Conservatives for American Excellence are on the same side in Tuesday's primary to replace retiring GOP Rep. Jake LaTurner. Both are backing former state Attorney General Derek Schmidt.\n\nKansas Republicans will also pick a candidate to take on Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids in the more competitive 3rd District, which Trump has not weighed in on.\n\nTrump has taken sides in Washington's 3rd District, where Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is a top Republican target as one of five Democrats representing a district Trump won in 2020. He has backed controversial Army veteran Joe Kent.\n\nKent lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by less than 1 percentage point in 2022 as he faced allegations about his ties to extreme groups. Kent faces Camas City Council member Leslie Lewallen in the primary. She has argued Kent would once again lose if he is the GOP nominee.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET in Michigan and Missouri and 9 p.m. ET in Kansas. Washington elections are conducted entirely by mail, and ballots must be postmarked on or before Election Day or placed in drop boxes by 11 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

Cori Bush's Democratic primary in Missouri is among the most expensive and hotly contested races Tuesday, when voters in four states -- Missouri, Washington, Michigan and Kansas -- pick their parties' nominees in congressional and state races.\n\nFour years after she ousted longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in the heavily Democratic 1st District, Bush is looking to win a race that has exposed the party's divisions over Israel.\n\nShe has faced an onslaught of attacks from United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group. The super PAC also spent millions to defeat a fellow \"squad\" member, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., in a June primary.\n\n'Squad' member Cori Bush faces Democratic primary putting a spotlight on Israel\n\nThe pro-Israel super PAC has also worked to boost Bush's challenger, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell, who was initially running for the Senate but decided to take on Bush a few weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nAnd Bush isn't the only House member on defense Tuesday.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., is once again looking to advance through a primary after he drew Trump's ire for voting to impeach him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nAlong with Rep. David Valadao of California, Newhouse is one of two pro-impeachment House Republicans still in office. The eight other Republicans either retired or lost to Trump-backed primary challengers two years ago.\n\nValadao and Newhouse have benefited from their states' top-two primary systems, in which all candidates compete on the same primary ballot and the top two vote-getters advance to November, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nTrump initially endorsed Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler in the race against Newhouse. But on Sunday, he also voiced support for former nurse Tiffany Smiley, who has outspent the rest of the field on the airwaves, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Smiley has also gotten a boost from a supportive super PAC. Meanwhile, America Leads Inc., a group that has backed two other GOP lawmakers facing primaries, has spent on ads to bolster Newhouse.\n\nA third House member -- Democrat Shri Thanedar -- is on defense in his primary in Michigan's 13th District. He faces two intraparty challengers vying for the seat he has held for nearly two years: Detroit City Council member Mary Waters, who has been endorsed by Mayor Mike Duggan, and attorney Shakira Lynn Hawkins.\n\nTuesday's primaries will also set the matchups in a slew of competitive races in Michigan, a swing state in presidential elections, which is also home to one of the top Senate races of the year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is not seeking a fifth term, and both party establishments have rallied around candidates to succeed her.\n\nTrump has endorsed former Rep. Mike Rogers, who had once been a strident critic of his. But Rogers is seen as one of the National Republican Senatorial Committee's big recruiting victories of the cycle, giving the GOP a candidate with a history of electoral success and appeal to independent voters.\n\nOther potentially strong contenders, including former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, former Rep. Peter Meijer and wealthy businessman Sandy Pensler, all ended their campaigns. That leaves former Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party in 2019 after having grown \"disenchanted\" and \"frightened\" by the GOP, as Rogers' top competition.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is seen as the party's front-runner, given her support from key party leaders and labor organizations. She faces a challenge from Hill Harper, a political newcomer and actor known for his work on the ABC series \"The Good Doctor.\"\n\nTuesday's primaries will also set the matchup in a number of competitive House races, including multiple ones in Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan's 3rd District, Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten faces multiple challenges to the seat she has held for nearly two years.\n\nScholten has the benefit of incumbency against Democratic challenger Salim Al-Shatel, a former small-business owner, former substitute teacher and real estate agent who graduated from Michigan State University in 2015.\n\nOn the GOP side, attorney Paul Hudson and financial adviser Michael Markey are competing to face off against the Democratic winner in November. So far, Trump has not weighed in on the Republican primary race.\n\nScholten defeated Republican John Gibbs by nearly 13 percentage points in the 2022 general election, flipping the seat for Democrats.\n\nNotably, on July 11, Scholten joined the chorus of congressional Democrats who called for President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, praising his leadership while encouraging him to pass the torch. She has since participated in a surrogate event for Vice President Kamala Harris in Grand Rapids late last month.\n\nThe 3rd District, in western Michigan, includes most of the Grand Rapids area and is home to battleground Kent County, which swung for Biden by about 6 points in 2020. (Biden won the entire state by less than 3 points.)\n\nThere are also competitive primaries on both sides in Michigan's 8th Congressional District, where Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election.\n\nRepublican contenders include Paul Junge, a former criminal prosecutor and TV news anchor who served in the Trump administration and has Trump's endorsement; Mary Draves, a former Dow Chemical executive; and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver. Former Flint Mayor Matt Collier, state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet and State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh are running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe general election there is seen as a tossup.\n\nThe matchup will also be set in Michigan's competitive 7th District to replace Slotkin. The parties have coalesced around two former state senators: Republican Tom Barrett, who lost a close race to Slotkin two years ago, and Democrat Curtis Hertel.\n\nTrump's endorsement will be put to the test in a handful of other races Tuesday.\n\nTrump endorsed multiple candidates in the Missouri governor's race, backing three of the top Republican contenders: Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nWith the state trending to the right, the winner of the GOP primary is expected to win the governor's race in November. Tuesday's primary will also set the matchup in the state's Senate race, with Marine veteran Lucas Kunce making another run against GOP Sen. Josh Hawley after he lost the 2022 Democratic primary.\n\nFurther down the ballot, Trump has backed former state Sen. Bob Onder to replace retiring GOP Rep. Blaine Leutkemeyer in the deep-red 3rd District.\n\nThe primary has attracted millions of dollars in outside spending. The conservative Club for Growth Action has backed Onder, while two establishment groups active in other GOP primaries, Conservatives for American Excellence and America Leads Action Inc., have launched ads attacking him.\n\nBut in Kansas' solidly Republican 2nd District, Trump and Conservatives for American Excellence are on the same side in Tuesday's primary to replace retiring GOP Rep. Jake LaTurner. Both are backing former state Attorney General Derek Schmidt.\n\nKansas Republicans will also pick a candidate to take on Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids in the more competitive 3rd District, which Trump has not weighed in on.\n\nTrump has taken sides in Washington's 3rd District, where Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is a top Republican target as one of five Democrats representing a district Trump won in 2020. He has backed controversial Army veteran Joe Kent.\n\nKent lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by less than 1 percentage point in 2022 as he faced allegations about his ties to extreme groups.

Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., in the Senate race while Republicans have united behind former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who received an endorsement from Donald Trump earlier this year. Both candidates are vying for a seat left open by longtime Democrat Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement, but they must first defeat underdog challengers Tuesday.\n\nSlotkin is up against actor Hill Harper, while Republicans will choose between Rogers, former Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., and physician Sherry O'Donnell. Although businessman Sandy Pensler dropped out and endorsed Rogers at a July 20 rally with Trump, his name will still appear on the ballot due to his late withdrawal.\n\nWith Democrats holding a razor-thin majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House, competitive races like those in Michigan are drawing lots of attention. The state's status as a key presidential swing state raises the stakes for those seats even higher, with party control on the line from the top of the ballot all the way down to the state Legislature.\n\nMichigan's open Senate seat is one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine control of the upper chamber in November. With a later congressional primary, candidates will have a short period to transition from competing against their own party members to appealing to a broader base of voters for the Nov. 5 general election, which may explain why Slotkin and Rogers have campaigned with their eyes on the general election.\n\nNational groups on both sides have already reserved millions for advertisements after the primary. Both Slotkin and Rogers, viewed for months as the overwhelming favorites in their primaries, have skipped debates and refrained from holding large campaign events.\n\nSeveral U.S. House seats with primaries on Tuesday could influence the balance of power in the lower chamber, but there, too, the biggest battles will be fought in the fall campaign.\n\nSlotkin's entry into the Senate race has left her mid-Michigan 7th Congressional District seat open, historically one of the nation's top battleground districts. Both party candidates are running unopposed in their primaries there, setting the table for a November matchup between Democrat Curtis Hertel Jr. and Republican Tom Barrett.\n\nThe 8th Congressional District is also an open race with Rep. Dan Kildee's retirement. The Democratic congressman has endorsed state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet to take his place, but state Board of Education President Pamela Pugh and Matt Collier, the former mayor of Flint, are also vying for the party's nomination.\n\nOn the Republican side, former TV anchor Paul Junge is making another bid after losing to Kildee by over 10 percentage points last year. Joining him in the race are Mary Draves, a former chemical manufacturing executive at Dow Inc., and Anthony Hudson.\n\nMeanwhile, several incumbents in battleground seats are waiting to see who they will face in November.\n\nRep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., who in 2022 became the first Democrat to represent Grand Rapids in decades, is awaiting the outcome of the Republican primary between attorney Paul Hudson and businessman Michael Markey Jr. in the western Michigan district.\n\nNational Democrats are also hoping to flip a district just north of Detroit currently held by freshman GOP Rep. John James. Carl Marlinga, a longtime Macomb County prosecutor who lost to James in 2022 by 1,600 votes, is facing Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley and Diane Young in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn a heavily Democrat district encompassing downtown Detroit, Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., faces a challenge from Detroit City Council member Mary Waters, who is endorsed by Mayor Mike Duggan. Thanedar has significantly outraised her and is favored to win the Democratic nomination, which would likely leave Detroit -- a city that is nearly 80% Black -- without Black representation in Congress for a second consecutive term.\n\nDown-ballot races are holding primaries across the state on Tuesday. Control of the state House of Representatives will be at stake in November, with all 110 seats up for election. Democrats took control of both chambers and the governor's office for the first time in four decades in 2022 and will be trying to defend those majorities.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com",

Jake LaTurner's announcement that he wasn't running for another term in the 2nd District -- citing a desire to be with his children and the \"dysfunction\" on the Hill -- came as a surprise, given he's one of the youngest members of Congress.\n\nHis departure has led to a crowded field of Republicans jockeying to succeed him. Frontrunners include former state Attorney General Derek Schmidt; former LaTurner staffer Jeff Kahrs; and Shawn Tiffany, a rancher. Schmidt unsuccessfully ran for governor in the midterms, but he has a perceived leg up, thanks to an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Nancy Boyda is also looking to make a comeback, though she'll face an uphill climb in this deep-red seat.\n\nKansas also features a battleground House race in the 3rd District, a seat that President Joe Biden won by around 5 points in 2020. Prasanth Reddy, a physician with the backing of Speaker Mike Johnson, is the favorite for the GOP nod against Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, and 9 p.m. Eastern in the small part in the Mountain Time Zone.\n\n-- Michigan: A high-stakes open Senate race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow tops Tuesday's primaries in this battleground state. Both parties have their presumed candidates -- Rep. Elissa Slotkin for Democrats, and former Rep. Mike Rogers for Republicans -- though they have contested primaries.\n\nHill Harper, an actor and activist, is looking to complicate Slotkin's path to victory, but Slotkin has a hefty fundraising advantage and the backing of establishment Democrats. Rogers, meanwhile, has the support of Republicans' Senate campaign arm. He'll be fending off a challenge from former Rep. Justin Amash (who previously left the GOP to become a Libertarian) and physician Sherry O'Donnell. Businessperson Sandy Pensler ended his bid and endorsed Rogers last month, but will still appear on the ballot.\n\nA handful of battleground House primaries are also on the docket. One of the most competitive down-ballot contests here is in the 8th District, a seat the Biden narrowly won in 2020 and will be open as Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee calls it quits. On the Democratic side, state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet has the backing of Kildee and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, but faces a challenge from former Flint Mayor Matt Collier and state Board of Education President Pamela Pugh. Republican Paul Junge, who lost in the general election for this seat in the midterms, has the stiffest challenge from former chemical company executive Mary Draves. Trump threw his backing behind Junge.\n\nOther battleground races in the Great Lakes State will be taking place in the 3rd, 7th and 10th districts. In the 3rd, a seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten that Biden won by around 9 points in 2020, attorney Paul Hudson and businessperson Michael Markey are competing for the GOP nod. There's little intrigue in the 7th, currently held by Slotkin: Former Democratic state Sen. Curtis Hertel and 2022 Republican nominee Tom Barrett don't have opponents in their respective primaries. And in the 10th, a seat that Trump won by around 1 point in 2020, Republican Rep. John James could face a rematch from unsuccessful 2022 candidate Carl Marlinga, who has to get through a busy Democratic primary first.\n\nEarlier this cycle, it seemed that Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar, an Indian-American lawmaker representing a predominantly Black seat in the Detroit-based 13th District, could be in trouble during his primary. But he faces an easier path to reelection after his most serious threat failed to submit enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The incumbent now has two lesser-known challengers, both of whom are Black.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, and 9 p.m. Eastern in the rest.\n\n-- Missouri: Despite the barrage of spending against Bush, she's not without reinforcements. Progressive group Justice Democrats is her biggest supporter, pouring in more than $2 million on advertising.\n\nAnd not all the drama in the state is happening in the Democratic primary between Bush and Bell.\n\nA contentious Republican primary is underway to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Mike Parson. Parson-backed Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Sen. Bill Eigel have emerged as the leading candidates, and have leaned into red-meat issues in the lead-up to the election, including immigration and China.\n\nTrump pulled a familiar gambit in this race: He endorsed all three of them, all but certainly guaranteeing him a win. Democratic state House Minority Leader Crystal Quade and businessperson Mike Hamra are the frontrunners for the Democratic primary, though the winner will face an uphill climb in this red state.\n\nDemocrats are also hoping that a familiar name can help them in a tough battle against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley. Democrat Lucas Kunce, who unsuccessfully ran in a Senate primary in the midterms, is the favorite for his party's nomination this time around.\n\nThere's also a crowded GOP primary in the 3rd District, an open, deep-red seat currently held by retiring Republican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer. Heavy spending has poured in -- around $5 million -- against Trump-endorsed Bob Onder, a former state senator. That includes more than $1 million each from Conservatives for American Excellence and America Leads Action Inc., two groups that have spent in safe GOP primaries nationally this cycle in an attempt to block potential rabble-rousers from Congress. National Interest Action, a recently formed group that also played in an Arizona primary, also has dropped more than $1 million on advertising.\n\nBut Onder has been boosted by more than $2 million from the Club for Growth and affiliated groups. Kurt Schaefer, also a former state legislator, is in the running as well, and has been supported by more than $1 million in spending from Missouri Conservatives for Congress, a group bankrolled by Luetkemeyer, who endorsed him.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m Eastern.\n\n-- Washington: Along with Missouri, Washington also has an open gubernatorial seat. Outgoing Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, along with Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, are all backing state Attorney General Bob Ferguson. Former Republican Rep. Dave Reichert is also a favorite to secure a spot out of the all party, top-two primary -- though Semi Bird, a former local school board member, has the backing of the state GOP.\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, one of the most vulnerable House Democrats, faces off against two Republicans in the 3rd District, which Trump carried by around 4 points. Republican Joe Kent, who lost by less than 1 point in 2022, is back for a second attempt; and Leslie Lewallen, a local city councilmember, is trying to convince the district she has a better chance of beating Gluesenkamp Perez in November. Lewallen is campaigning as a more moderate Republican option, but has trailed both other candidates in fundraising.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez, meanwhile, continues to push her working-class, party renegade image, while Kent aims to paint her as too progressive for the district. The two have spent the runup to Election Day embroiled in a battle on X, and at their campaign rallies, over Gluesenkamp Perez's vote against a 2023 House bill that would have banned transgender athletes.\n\nIn Washington's 8th District, another battleground, just one Republican, Carmen Goers, is running to take on Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier. But Goers doesn't have strong fundraising, putting her at a disadvantage for the general election.\n\nWashington's safe seats also have seen a flurry of campaigning ahead of the primary. One of the last two Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 is fighting for his political life in the safe red 4th District. GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse faces off against not one but two Trump-endorsed candidates: former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler and Tiffany Smiley, a nurse who lost her Senate run in 2022.\n\nNewhouse outraised and outspent the field, but political experts and strategists say this is the most vulnerable he's ever been. Some voters in his district last week who spoke to POLITICO criticized Newhouse for not showing up to local events and not taking a strong enough stance on issues like border security.\n\nThe state's unique all-party primary adds an additional layer to uncertainty. Democrats have made up roughly a third of the electorate in recent elections, so two Republicans could theoretically advance to a general election. That could be Newhouse versus another, Trump-endorsed Republican -- or Newhouse could get locked out entirely.\n\nSimilar dynamics are at play in the 6th District, a deep-blue seat held by retiring Rep. Derek Kilmer. Democrats Hilary Franz, the state's public lands commissioner, and state Sen. Emily Randall are the leading contenders. Kilmer endorsed Franz, while Randall has the backing of Murray, Gluesenkamp Perez and Rep. Marilyn Strickland. It's possible both make it to the general election, though it's unlikely given a split Democratic vote.\n\nAnd in the 5th District, a crowded Republican field is vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, including former state Sen. Michael Baumgartner, who has raised and spent the most out of the contenders.\n\nA version of this story first appeared in POLITICO Pro's Morning Score newsletter.

While not every race on Aug. 6 will capture Americans' attention, more than a few could have major ramifications.\n\nIn Michigan, Democrats and Republicans are stepping up to replace Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who has held her seat for almost a quarter century. Other races in competitive districts will help drive events ahead of November's general election when many eyes will be on the battleground state.\n\nVoters across Missouri will cast their ballots in crucial statewide elections. Those in St. Louis will decide the fate of Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), who risks a Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.)-style primary loss triggered by her criticism of Israel.\n\nWashington State is host to many competitive races, including a few that test the power of an endorsement, or co-endorsement, from former President Donald Trump.\n\nHere's a rundown of the biggest Aug. 6 races by state.\n\nStabenow's retirement announcement in January opened up another seat Republicans will contest as the party attempts to take the Senate this cycle. The race also adds to the attention Michigan will already get as a critical presidential battleground state.\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) has a huge fundraising lead, with more than $24 million in receipts placing her ahead of any Democrat or Republican hopeful. The polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight shows the former CIA analyst has held a consistent lead over a likely GOP rival, former Rep. Mike Rogers.\n\nIn the Aug. 6 Democratic primary, Slotkin will face actor Hill Harper, who has raised over $2.8 million.\n\nAnother hopeful, Nasser Beydoun, was disqualified from appearing on the ballot. His challenge to that decision was shot down by the Michigan Court of Appeals in June.\n\nThe Republican field is a little more crowded.\n\nRogers, who has raised more than $5.3 million to date, will compete against physician Sherry O'Donnell and another former congressman, Justin Amash. Elected as a Republican, Amash briefly served as a Libertarian after changing parties in 2020. Sandy Pensler, another candidate, dropped out in late July and threw his support behind Rogers.\n\nIn central Michigan, the state's Eighth District is rated a \"Democrat toss-up\" by the Cook Political Report and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball. Its current representative, Rep. Dan Kildee (R-Mich.), is not seeking reelection.\n\nThe Democratic primary for territory that includes Saginaw, Bay City, and Flint will feature Matt Collier, the former mayor of Flint, Michigan; Pamela Pugh, the president of the Michigan Board of Education; and state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet.\n\nOn the Republican side, retired Dow Chemical executive Mary Draves will compete against truck driver Anthony Hudson and Paul Junge, a past hopeful in the district who served in the Trump administration.\n\nThe district that Slotkin is vacating is also competitive between the two parties. It is rated a \"toss-up\" by Sabato and a \"Democrat toss-up\" by Cook.\n\nRanging from territory west of Lansing to the outer suburbs of Detroit, the district will feature uncontested primaries on both sides. Republicans will be able to vote for Tom Barrett, a former state senator. Democrats will be able to vote for Curtis Hertel, also a previous member of the Michigan Senate. Federal campaign finance data shows that, so far, the financial advantage belongs to Hertel.\n\nFreshman Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) is defending her seat in a primary in the 3rd, rated \"likely Democrat\" by Cook. Entrepreneur Salim Al-Shatel is challenging her in that contest.\n\nThe Republican primary in the 3rd District, a chunk of western Michigan that includes Grand Rapids and Grand Haven, is also a two-person race. Lawyer Paul Hudson is running against entrepreneur Michael Markey Jr.\n\nThe district, which is made up of suburban territory north of Detroit, is also helmed by a freshman, Rep. John James (R-Mich.). He's running unopposed in his party's primary. Cook labels the district \"lean Republican\" this cycle.\n\nFour Democrats -- Carl Marlinga, Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley, and Diane Young -- are competing in that primary. Marlinga, a retired judge, lost to James in the 2022 general election. Busch is a gun safety advocate. Tilley serves on the Michigan Board of Education. Young is a financial planner.\n\nWhile much of the Show Me State leans Republican, in St. Louis, the 1st Congressional District will judge whether Bush will serve a third term in the House. The district's heavily Democratic skew means the primary winner is virtually guaranteed an easy win in the general.\n\nBush, who unseated longtime Democrat congressman Lacy Clay in the largely black and urban district covering most of St. Louis and its northern suburbs in 2020, is facing a stiff primary challenge from Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is dumping millions into anti-Bush and pro-Bell advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in St. Louis. According to its latest federal campaign finance reports, AIPAC-linked super political action committee United Democracy Project had spent about $8.6 million to knock out Bush as of Aug. 2.\n\nIf Bell prevails, Bush will be the second member of the so-called \"Squad\" of left-wing Democrats to lose an intraparty primary contest this election cycle.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are positioning themselves to run for five of the six positions in Missouri's executive branch up for grabs in the fall. No Democrat has held a statewide office since Nicole Galloway was elected state auditor in 2018. She left office in 2023.\n\nThe biggest race of the night is the three-way contest to replace outgoing Gov. Mike Parson. Three other Republicans -- Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, and state Sen. Bill Eigel -- are running a close race with no clear favorite.\n\nMissouri will also winnow the field for the positions of Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, and Attorney General. The only incumbents are Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Missouri State Treasurer Vivek Malek.\n\nThe down-ballot race attracting the most national attention is the intra-Republican contest between incumbent Bailey and his lone challenger, Will Scharf.\n\nScharf, who worked on the legal team for former President Donald Trump, is backed by conservative activist Leonard Leo, wealthy GOP megadonor Paul Singer and the influential Club for Growth. Bailey, who was appointed by Parson and looking for his first full term as the state's top law enforcement official, is backed by local power players, including Missouri megadonor Rex Sinquefield.\n\nWhile Michigan and Missouri have partisan primaries, in Washington, all candidates, regardless of party, will be on the same ballot. The top two finishers, regardless of party, will advance to the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nFirst-term Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) is running for reelection in a Republican-leaning district in the state's southwest. Cook rates the district a \"Democrat toss-up.\"\n\nGluesenkamp Perez succeeded former Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), a six-term member who voted for the second impeachment of then-President Trump in 2021. Beutler was subsequently denounced by Trump and defeated in the 2022 primary by former U.S. Army officer Joe Kent -- the widower of an American soldier who was killed in Syria. Kent, who was endorsed by Trump, lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by 0.8 percent in 2022.\n\nKent is running again, and again with Trump's backing. Leslie Lewallen, a Camas City Councillor, is also running as a Republican. John Saulie-Rohman is running as an independent.\n\nAs a vulnerable House Democrat with no Democratic challengers, Gluesenkamp Perez has gained more than $6.7 million in campaign contributions, over five times Kent's fundraising of $1.3 million.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), a five-term incumbent, is running for re-election in a heavily Republican seat. Yet, he is facing a primary challenge from Republican candidates Jerrold Sessler and Tiffany Smiley. Both were co-endorsed by Trump, part of a trend in split endorsements by the party's presidential nominee. Like Beutler, Newhouse voted in favor of the second impeachment of Trump in 2021, following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nIn 2022, no Trump-endorsed candidate advanced from the primary to the general election. Newhouse won the latter with 66.5 percent of the vote.\n\nWhile he currently leads in fundraising, polling from Smiley's campaign showed her leading Newhouse by 9 percentage points.\n\nWashington's Fifth has an open primary after 10-term Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) -- a former House Republican Conference chair who leads the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee -- announced in February that she would not seek re-election. The seat, which covers eastern Washington, leans solidly Republican, according to Cook.\n\nPolling on the race has not been published, though Republican candidate and Spokane County Treasurer Michael Baumgartner is ahead in fundraising with $790,000 in receipts. Baumgartner is a former state senator and, in 2012, lost to U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) as the Republican nominee for Senate.\n\nOther notable Republicans running are state Rep. Jacquelin Maycumber and former state Sen. Brian Dansel.\n\nSix-term Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) is retiring, creating an open primary. The race has attracted prominent Democratic challengers -- the state's Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz and state Sen. Emily Randall.\n\nWhile the district has elected Democrats since 1965, one Republican challenger, state Sen. Drew MacEwen, previously flipped a Democratic-held seat to enter the state Senate in 2022. Non-profit founder Janis Clark is another Republican contending for the seat.\n\nFranz and Randall have raised over $1 million each, while MacEwen has raised over $153,000. The district leans Democratic by six points according to Cook, meaning that -- if MacEwen makes it to the second round -- the sole Democratic candidate is favored to win the general election. Should Franz and Randall advance, however, it would set up a Democrat v. Democrat election campaign.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Stabenow", "type": "person",

Gretchen Whitmer, who largely took herself out of the race by last week, or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a Traverse City resident, who gets the spot.\n\nHarris and her vice presidential nominee will then begin a swing through battleground states in Philadelphia, before visiting Michigan on Wednesday and Thursday for events that have not yet been made public but will no doubt command lots of attention.\n\nThen there's also Monday's big stock sell-off globally and whether it portends a temporary slow down or a potential recession, as some fear.\n\nIt's been a recurring theme this election year, national news overtaking local political races, but here are three things to keep an eye on as the returns start to come in on Tuesday night, after polls close at 8 p.m.\n\nThe open U.S. Senate seat in Michigan, being vacated by Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow after four six-year terms, is the big statewide contest being voted on in November (other than the presidency, which Michigan will help decide with a handful of other swing states). No Republican has won a U.S. Senate race in Michigan in 30 years, but it's considered a close call this year, depending on how circumstances play out.\n\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, has long been considered the frontrunner for her party's nomination, having a considerable advantage in fundraising and political experience over her competition. But Detroit actor Hill Harper has been working hard to try to close the gap with Slotkin and was closing out the primary Monday night with a virtual get-out-the-vote rally with rappers Ludacris and Akon.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic nomination, he or she was set to face one of three Republicans: Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of Brighton, former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash of Cascade Charter Township or west Michigan Dr. Sherry O'Donnell. Rogers is considered the likely nominee, having the support of institutional Republicans and former President (and current GOP nominee) Donald Trump. If it were to be other than a Slotkin-Rogers matchup, it would spell a major upset but how the votes shake out could tell us a lot about just how engaged voters are in this race and if the favorites are as strong as they seem.\n\nThere are three, maybe four, races among Michigan's 13 U.S. House seats that could be considered toss-ups, only two of which have incumbents - one Republican, one Democrat - running for reelection.\n\nTuesday's voting, once we have the results, will give us a better idea of how the fall races will shake out.\n\nIn Michigan's 10th Congressional District, centered on southern Macomb County and eastern Oakland County, U.S. Rep. John James, R-Shelby Township, is running unopposed for a nomination to a second two-year term. But after winning by a slim margin in 2022, he (and we) will have to wait to see if he again faces former Macomb County Judge Carl Marlinga or one of the other Democrats: Emily Busch of Oxford, Diane Young of Warren or state Board of Education member Tiffany Tilley of West Bloomfield.\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, faces Salim Al-Shatel, a west Michigan businessman in her reelection primary. If she were to somehow lose, it would be a major upset. The Democratic winner will face either Paul Hudson, an East Grand Rapids lawyer, or Grand Haven financial planner Michael Markey, who are running for the GOP nomination in this marginally Democratic district.\n\nThen there are the two open U.S. House seats.\n\nIn the 8th Congressional District, a tossup seat was put up for grabs by the surprise announcement of U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, that he would not run for reelection in the district that includes Bay City, Flint and Saginaw. Running for the Republican nomination are Paul Junge, of Grand Blanc, who lost to Kildee two years ago but has Trump's endorsement; Mary Draves, of Midland, a former Dow Chemical executive; and Anthony Hudson, a small businessman from Grand Blanc. Meanwhile, state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City is running for the Democratic nod with Kildee's endorsement. She faces Pamela Pugh, of Saginaw, who is the president of the state Board of Education, and former Flint Mayor Matt Collier. However this race turns out, expect lots of attention and outside money to be showered on it in the fall.\n\nThe other tossup race is in mid-Michigan's 7th Congressional District and we already know the nomination winners there because both were unopposed Tuesday: former state Sen. Tom Barrett of Charlotte, in the Republican primary, and former state Sen. Curtis Hertel of Lansing, in the Democratic primary. They'll face each other in November for the seat Slotkin (see U.S. Senate race above) is relinquishing.\n\nSince Michigan adopted no-reason absentee voting in 2018, turnout has generally been up (substantially so in some elections) and the restrictions on early voting that were loosened ahead of this year's balloting could further help that. But for much of this election, enthusiasm has appeared to be down among voters, especially those who weren't overwhelmed by the fact that it appeared President Joe Biden and Trump would face each other in this year's presidential election.\n\nSince Biden stepped aside for Harris as the Democratic nominee late last month, however, Democrats have felt a surge in enthusiasm and the primary - not to mention Harris' impending visit - could be indicators of just how much energy there is. They could also help determine if Republicans embrace absentee voting after Trump bashing it as inherently corrupt four years ago (even if he has changed his tune somewhat this year). For anyone who does plan to vote in person at the polls on Tuesday, there is expected to be rain across much of Michigan, which could potentially reduce turnout. We'll certainly be keeping an eye out for any oddities, problems or trends.\n\nPolls will open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. (though remember there are four counties in the western Upper Peninsula in the Central time zone). It's anyone's guess how long it will take to get winners called in the races: Because absentee votes can't be counted early, it often takes hours - if not into the next morning or longer - to get the unofficial results completed.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

This week, voters will head to the polls in four states: Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Washington.\n\nWhile Kansas has four congressional districts, there's a particularly crowded primary to replace Republican Rep. Jacob LaTurner in the 2nd Congressional District. He announced in April that he would not seek reelection.\n\nWhile there are two Democrats running for the seat, there are five Republicans running to replace LaTurner in this race that's considered to be \"Safe\" or \"Solid Republican.\"\n\nMissouri has perhaps the race to watch tonight, as Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), a member of The Squad, could lose her primary to DA Wesley Bell in Missouri's 1st Congressional District. There's also three other challengers running against Bush. Just as we saw with soon-to-be former Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), another member of The Squad with his primary from late June, Bush has been targeted by pro-Israel groups such as AIPAC and DMFI for her anti-Israel stance.\n\nThe Show-Me State has plenty of other races, from U.S. Senate, to governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, treasurer, and attorney general. There are also ballot questions regarding \"Property Tax Exemption for Childcare Establishments Measure\" (Amendment 1) and to \"Allow Legislature to Require a City to Increase Funding without State Reimbursement for a Police Force Established by State Board Measure\" (Amendment 4).\n\nAlthough Republican Sen. Josh Hawley does not face a primary challenger, there are four Democrats running to face him in November.\n\nThe gubernatorial race may be another one to watch, given there are five Republicans running, with former and potentially future President Donald Trump having endorsed three candidates.\n\nMichigan is just now finally having its primary, though we should know who the Republican and Democratic nominees will be not long after the polls close at 8:00p.m. ET in most of the state, but 9:00p.m. ET in other parts which go by Central Time.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is considered the heavy favorite to win her party's nomination, while former Rep. Mike Rogers is heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. This is an open seat due to Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement.\n\nWashington has plenty of statewide races, where they use a jungle primary system. We could thus see a Democrat facing another Democrat in the general election, for instance. There's also non-party affiliation candidates.\n\nThe race to watch in the Evergreen State is the 3rd Congressional District, where Joe Kent is running once again. He managed to unseat former Republican Rep. Jaime Lynn Herrera Beutler in 2022, who was then the incumbent, but ultimately lost to now Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez.\n\nWe're partnering with Decision Desk HQ to bring you the most up-to-date election results, which you can find below.

While not every race on Aug. 6 will capture Americans' attention, more than a few could have major ramifications.\n\nIn Michigan, Democrats and Republicans are stepping up to replace Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who has held her seat for almost a quarter century. Other races in competitive districts will help drive events ahead of November's general election when many eyes will be on the battleground state.\n\nVoters across Missouri will cast their ballots in crucial statewide elections. Those in St. Louis will decide the fate of Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), who risks a Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.)-style primary loss triggered by her criticism of Israel.\n\nWashington State is host to many competitive races, including a few that test the power of an endorsement, or co-endorsement, from former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the Aug. 6 Democratic primary, Slotkin will face actor Hill Harper, who has raised over $2.8 million.\n\nAnother hopeful, Nasser Beydoun, was disqualified from appearing on the ballot. His challenge to that decision was shot down by the Michigan Court of Appeals in June.\n\nThe Republican field is a little more crowded.\n\nThe Democratic primary for territory that includes Saginaw, Bay City, and Flint will feature Matt Collier, the former mayor of Flint, Michigan; Pamela Pugh, the president of the Michigan Board of Education; and state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet.\n\nBush, who unseated longtime Democrat congressman Lacy Clay in the largely black and urban district covering most of St. Louis and its northern suburbs in 2020, is facing a stiff primary challenge from Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.\n\nMissouri will also winnow the field for the positions of Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, and Attorney General. The only incumbents are Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Missouri State Treasurer Vivek Malek.\n\nThe down-ballot race attracting the most national attention is the intra-Republican contest between incumbent Bailey and his lone challenger, Will Scharf.\n\nScharf, who worked on the legal team for former President Donald Trump, is backed by conservative activist Leonard Leo, wealthy GOP megadonor Paul Singer and the influential Club for Growth. Bailey, who was appointed by Parson and looking for his first full term as the state's top law enforcement official, is backed by local power players, including Missouri megadonor Rex Sinquefield.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez succeeded former Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), a six-term member who voted for the second impeachment of then-President Trump in 2021. Beutler was subsequently denounced by Trump and defeated in the 2022 primary by former U.S. Army officer Joe Kent -- the widower of an American soldier who was killed in Syria. Kent, who was endorsed by Trump, lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by 0.8 percent in 2022.\n\nKent is running again, and again with Trump's backing. Leslie Lewallen, a Camas City Councillor, is also running as a Republican. John Saulie-Rohman is running as an independent.\n\nIn 2022, no Trump-endorsed candidate advanced from the primary to the general election. Newhouse won the latter with 66.5 percent of the vote.\n\nPolling on the race has not been published, though Republican candidate and Spokane County Treasurer Michael Baumgartner is ahead in fundraising with $790,000 in receipts. Baumgartner is a former state senator and, in 2012, lost to U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) as the Republican nominee for Senate.\n\nWhile the district has elected Democrats since 1965, one Republican challenger, state Sen. Drew MacEwen, previously flipped a Democratic-held seat to enter the state Senate in 2022. Non-profit founder Janis Clark is another Republican contending for the seat.\n\nFranz and Randall have raised over $1 million each, while MacEwen has raised over $153,000. The district leans Democratic by six points according to Cook, meaning that -- if MacEwen makes it to the second round -- the sole Democratic candidate is favored to win the general election. Should Franz and Randall advance, however, it would set up a Democrat v. Democrat election campaign.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The biggest storm tonight will take place in Missouri, where yet another Squad member may get bounced out of Congress. We have other \"whether fronts\" forming in Michigan, Kansas, and Washington state tonight too. Settle in for a long evening, and potentially a sea change in St. Louis, just to mix a metaphor or two!\n\nAs always, we'll have live results as they come in. And once again, we are partnering with our friends at Decision Desk HQ to provide real-time vote results after polls close, which will happen at various times tonight. The widgets below will list those times, and will automatically update. Please note: The House primaries are all available in a single widget for each party; you will need to use the drop-down box to choose the race you want.\n\nWe're able to do this, of course, in large part because of the support of our VIP and VIP Gold members. Become a HotAir VIP member today and use promo code 2024 to receive a 50% discount on your membership.\n\nLet's take these in order of poll closing times ...\n\nThis is the Big Kahuna tonight. In Missouri's first CD, Democrat incumbent and Squad member Cori Bush faces a well-funded Democrat challenger in Wesley Bell. Bush has more endorsements from current party leader, but Bell has been ahead in the polls; the most current survey puts him up six points over Bush. Needless to say, whoever wins tonight will essentially win the D+27 district in November. A red wave that puts a Republican in this seat would be a 50-state tsunami.\n\nBoth parties have open primaries for the gubernatorial race, thanks to term limits on current incumbent Mike Parson. All three GOP candidates have Trump's endorsement, and it appears that this will be mainly between Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe. Bill Eigel has plenty of experience in the legislature, though, and could be a threat. Democrats probably won't be able to compete in November in this increasingly red state; five are on the ballot, but it will come down to either Crystal Quade or Mike Hamra.\n\nFinally, expect to see Lucas Kunce to win the Democrat nomination to take on Josh Hawley for the US Senate seat. He has raised almost $8 million in this cycle, and he might be tough in the general election.\n\nPolls close at 8 pm ET across the state. Missouri requires all mail and early ballots to be in when the polls close, so we should get firm results by the end of the night. You may be waiting a long time to see what happens in the Bush/Bell race, though, because St. Louis is slooooow with their vote counting.\n\nThe big stories in Kansas come from two congressional seats. First up is KS-02, where incumbent Republican Jake LaTurner is retiring in this R+11 district that went for Trump in 2020 by 15 points. Derek Schmidt has a wide lead in the only poll taken in this eastern-state district and he has the Trump endorsement. He has three challengers, but expect him to win handily. He'll likely go up against former Rep. Nancy Boyda, the last Dem to hold this seat -- for one session after the 2006 blue wave.\n\nKS-03 is more interesting. This R+1 district is the only one in Kansas represented by a Democrat, Sharice Davids. Karen Crnkovich and Prasanth Reddy will square off to win the nomination; Reddy has a lot more funding and is slightly less moderate.\n\nPolls close at 8 pm ET in most of the state, although the few counties in Mountain Time will close at 9 ET. Kansas does have some mail-in balloting that could take up to three days to complete, but we expect almost all of the votes to be counted by the end of the night.\n\nDemocrat incumbent Sen Gary Peters will retire at the end of this session, so both parties have an opportunity to make some changes. The favorite in the Democrat primary is Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who should get an early call. Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers is a heavy favorite to defeat Justin Amash, also a former House member, and has raised a lot of money and gotten the Trump endorsement to boot. If Rogers wins as expected, he might be the most formidable GOP nominee for a Senate race in a while, in terms of political standing.\n\nIn the House races, the most promising comes in Michigan's 8th, an R+1 district with a retiring Dan Kildee, the current incumbent. Slotkin had this district before she got redistricted to MI-07, but before that the GOP had it for nine straight terms -- seven by Rogers, a bit of irony tonight considering their likely contest for the Senate seat. State Senator Kristen McDonald Rivet is favored for the Democrat nomination but still faces a fight from former Flint mayor Matthew Collier and Pamela Pugh, a black woman with experience on the state board of education.\n\nFor the GOP, Paul Junge returns after coming close in the last two cycles against both Kildee and Slotkin. He's expected to ride a fundraising and polling advantage to a clear victory over two lesser-known Republicans.\n\nPolls close at 8 pm ET in most of the state, but four counties in the Upper Peninsula will remain open until 9. All ballots including mail and absentee have to be in by poll closing, so the results will be known at some point overnight ... or maybe closer to daybreak.\n\nIs there any interest for Republicans in this primary? Maybe only in WA-05, where both parties are holding competitive primaries for an R+8 district. WA-06 is a D+6 district and could be primed for a Republican takeaway in November, depending on how the national trends look. WA-04 has a Republican incumbent (Dan Newhouse) in a R+11 district facing a Trump-endorsed challenger in Jerrod Sessler. Washington is a jungle-primary state, however, so both Newhouse and Sessler may face each other in November as the Democrats didn't organize well enough to have a serious contender.\n\nDon't get too invested in any of them tonight. Polls close at 11 ET, but Washington is a mail-only state, and only about 60% of the vote will get counted tonight. They'll be at it for days on end.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_morrissey@hotair.com", "name": "Ed Morrissey", "type": "author",

Gretchen Whitmer - campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire - says she's staying in Michigan when asked about serving as running mate.\n\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers won the Republican primary for Senate in Michigan on Tuesday and will battle it out in the November election for the state's open Senate seat.\n\nRogers served in the House from 2001-2015. During his tenure in Congress, he was chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n\nHe faced off against another former Rep. Justin Amash, who aligned himself with more libertarian-leaning politicians. Amash served from 2011-2021.\n\nAmash left the Republican Party in 2019, criticizing the two-party system in particular. He has also been an outspoken voice against former President Trump -- which is unusual among elected Republicans.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS 'INVISIBLE' IN CRITICAL SWING STATE OF MICHIGAN: REPORT\n\nHe is also a Palestinian-American, like many others in the state of Michigan, and has been critical of U.S. funding to Israel. The Michigan Republican primary field was initially much larger, with former Rep. Peter Meijer making a run as well, before ending his bid earlier this year.\n\nKEY PRIMARIES IN 4 STATES ON TUESDAY TO SET TABLE FOR NOVEMBER SENATE, HOUSE SHOWDOWNS\n\nBusinessman Sandy Pensler recently suspended his campaign for the nod and endorsed front-runner Rogers at a Trump rally in Michigan. Trump endorsed Rogers in the primary in March.\n\nRogers will now take on the winner of Tuesdays Democrat primary in the November general election, in what will be pivotal race to determine whether Republicans will hold the Senate majority and by how many seats. Non-Partisan political handicapper the Cook Political Report rated the race as a \"Toss Up\" alongside races in Montana, Ohio, and Nevada.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_johnson@foxnews.com", "name": "Julia Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Michigan_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Amash", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Amash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-party system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Meijer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Meijer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/RNC-Donald-Trump-Day-2_34.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794330", "eventUri": "eng-9794330", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Elissa Slotkin on pandemic relief spending, according to an ad shared first with NBC News.\n\nSlotkin easily won her party's primary Tuesday, setting up a race against GOP former Rep. Mike Rogers in November. And Republicans are wasting no time attacking Slotkin, who is in her third term, in a race that will be key to Senate control.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee's independent expenditure ad, its first of the election cycle, kicks off a $10 million buy in the Michigan race.\n\nThe NRSC's ad, which will run on TV, radio and digital platforms, targets Slotkin's support for government spending during the coronavirus pandemic, criticizing her support for a measure that provided stimulus checks to millions of people, as well as prisoners.\n\nThe ad notes that stimulus check recipients included former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, who was convicted of committing sexual assaults against hundreds of girls and women on the national team and in Michigan, and convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\n\n\"Elissa Slotkin voted for wasteful spending that sent inflation through the roof and made life unaffordable for Michigan families,\" NRSC spokeswoman Maggie Abboud said in a statement. \"Larry Nassar and the Boston Marathon bomber benefitted from Slotkin's policies -- Michiganders got hosed.\"\n\nFederal judges did order Tsarnaev and Nassar to hand over their stimulus payments, as well as other funds in their accounts, to victims.\n\nOne Nation, the nonprofit arm of the GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, also launching its first ad in the race as part of a $9.4 million buy that will run through Labor Day, and targeted Slotkin on pandemic spending.\n\n\"Elissa Slotkin's votes for reckless spending have cost Michigan families thousands,\" a narrator says in the ad. \"Tell Elissa Slotkin 'no thank you' to the wasteful spending and to start putting Michigan families first.\"\n\nThe 30-second spot, which will run on television, radio and online platforms, will run in Michgian's competitive 7th District, which Slotkin represents in the House.\n\nOne Nation President and CEO Steven Law said in a statement, \"Elissa Slotkin's constituents trusted her to be a good steward of their hard-earned money, but instead she's costing them thousands of dollars.\"\n\nSlotkin said when she supported the pandemic relief measure in early 2021 that the pandemic was \"the number one threat to Michiganders' health and economic security right now.\"\n\n\"That said, there are certainly aspects of this bill I don't like,\" Slotkin said in a statement at the time. \"As with earlier COVID relief packages we have considered, it's far from perfect. I would have preferred a more targeted distribution of stimulus checks, and that we had kept this package narrowly tailored to COVID relief.\"\n\nSlotkin faced attacks over her support for government spending in her 2022 re-election to the House, which was one of the most expensive races in the country. She defeated then-state Sen. Tom Barrett by 5 percentage points.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also hit the airwaves in Michigan, with its independent expenditure arm launching new TV ads in the Wolverine State as well as Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe DSCC's ad targets Rogers' himself, highlighting his Florida home and his business dealings, alleging he is tied to special interests.\n\n\"Rogers made millions and now he wants to be senator so he can cash in again,\" a narrator says in the ad.\n\nRogers' campaign has previously said the former congressman has been transparent about his business dealings.\n\n\"Mike Rogers has always believed that Michiganders deserve full and complete transparency from their elected leaders, which is why he has consistently complied with Senate Ethics and FEC financial disclosure requirements,\" said campaign spokesman Chris Gustafson told Business Insider in February.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"},

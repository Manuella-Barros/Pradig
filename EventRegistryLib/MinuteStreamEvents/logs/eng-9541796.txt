Image: Reuters\n\nBrent crude oil price news: Oil prices fell in early Asian trading hours on Wednesday after market sources said that data from the American Petroleum Institute showed an increase in US crude and fuel stockpiles, an indicator of weak demand.\n\nBrent crude oil futures fell 21 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $82.95 a barrel by 0020 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 13 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $78.25 a barrel.\n\nUS crude stocks rose by 509,000 barrels in the week ended May 3, market sources said citing American Petroleum Institute figures. Gasoline and distillate fuel inventories also rose, they said.\n\nOfficial US government data on stockpiles is due at 1430 GMT. Analysts polled by Reuters expect US crude oil inventories to have fallen by about 1.1 million barrels last week. Both benchmarks fell marginally in the previous session on signs of easing supply tightness. The EIA updated its forecasts for 2024 and now expects world oil and liquids output to grow more this year than earlier projections, and demand to grow less than it previously thought.\n\nHopes of a ceasefire in Gaza have also put pressure on oil prices in recent sessions.

Both contracts had posted the steepest weekly losses in three months as the market focused on weak U.S. jobs data and the possible timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nPalestinian militant group Hamas on Monday agreed to a Gaza ceasefire proposal from mediators, but Israel said the terms did not meet its demands and pressed ahead with strikes in Rafah while planning to continue negotiations on a deal.\n\nIsraeli forces struck Rafah on Gaza's southern edge from the air and ground and ordered residents to leave parts of the city, which has been a refuge for more than 1 million displaced Palestinians.\n\nA lack of settlement between the parties in the now seven-month long conflict has supported oil prices, as investors worry regional escalation of the war will disrupt Middle Eastern crude supplies.\n\nSaudi Arabia's move to raise the official selling prices for its crude sold to Asia, Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean in June also supported prices, signalling expectations of strong demand this summer.\n\nThe world's top exporter hiked its flagship Arab Light crude oil price to Asia to $2.90 a barrel above the Oman/Dubai average in June, the highest since January and at the upper end of traders' expectations in a Reuters survey.\n\nMeanwhile, a stronger dollar capped gains in oil futures as it makes crude more expensive for traders holding other currencies. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, rose to 105.18 at 0400 GMT.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns traveled to Israel on Wednesday and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an Israel official said.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts said they see the geopolitical risk for oil prices dissipating as fears of further escalation in the conflict subside.\n\nCautious expectations on supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) ahead of a June 1 policy meeting also weighed on markets.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that there had been no discussions about an oil output increase by OPEC+.\n\nThis came after an earlier statement in the day in which he said the group had the option of increasing production.\n\n(Reporting by Nicole Jao in New York; additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar in London, Trixie Yap in Singapore; editing by Jason Neely, Kirsten Donovan, Elaine Hardcastle and Leslie Adler)", "source": {"uri": "globalbankingandfinance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Banking & Finance Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns traveled to Israelon Wednesday and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an Israel official said.\n\n(Reporting by Nicole Jao in New York; additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar in London, Trixie Yap in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler)", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns will travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nSome analysts expectations that short-term demand remains well-supported limited overall price declines.\n\n\"Much talk of economic run cuts in recent weeks is overblown in our opinion, with margins still healthy enough, which means rather that Asian demand could rather pick up once turnarounds peak and diminish,\" said Sparta Commodities analyst Neil Crosby. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Petroleum Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Israel Strikes Gaza, While Truce Talks Continue", "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Oil prices ticked up early on Tuesday after Israel struck Rafah in Gaza while negotiations for a ceasefire with Hamas continued without resolution.\n\nBrent crude futures were up 46 cents, or 0.55%, at $83.79 per barrel at 0010 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 46 cents, or 0.59%, to $78.94 a barrel.\n\nPrices had edged upward on Monday, partially reversing the declines of last week in which both contracts posted their steepest weekly loss in three months, with the focus on weak U.S. jobs data and the possible timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nPalestinian militant group Hamas on Monday agreed to a Gaza ceasefire proposal from mediators, but Israel said the terms did not meet its demands and pressed ahead with strikes in Rafah while planning to continue negotiations on a deal.\n\nIsraeli forces struck Rafah on Gaza's southern edge from the air and ground and ordered residents to leave parts of the city, which has been a refuge for more than a million displaced Palestinians.\n\nA lack of settlement between the parties in the now seven-month long conflict has supported prices, as investors worry that regional escalation of the war will disrupt Middle Eastern crude supplies.\n\nRiyadh's move to raise the official selling prices for its crude sold to Asia, Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean in June also supported prices, signalling expectations of strong demand this summer.\n\nThe world's top exporter hiked its flagship Arab Light crude oil price to Asia to $2.90 a barrel above the Oman/Dubai average in June, the highest since January and at the upper end of traders' expectations in a Reuters survey.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew

US Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns will travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nSome analyst expectations that short-term demand remains well-supported limited overall price declines.\n\n\"Much talk of economic run cuts in recent weeks is overblown in our opinion, with margins still healthy enough, which means rather that Asian demand could rather pick up once turnarounds peak and diminish,\" said Sparta Commodities analyst Neil Crosby.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Petroleum Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

News - 8th May, 2024) Oil prices fell on Wednesday following data indicating an increase in crude inventories in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude traded at $82.64 per barrel at 09.31 a.m. local time (0631 GMT), a decrease of 0.62% from the closing price of $83.16 per barrel in the previous trading session.\n\nAmerican benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at $77.88 per barrel at the same time, a 0.64% fall from the previous session that closed at $78.38 per barrel.\n\nOil prices were buoyed by data released by the American Petroleum Institute (API) late on Tuesday showing an increase of 509,000 barrels in US crude oil inventories, against the market expectation of a draw of 1.4 million barrels.\n\nThe rise in commercial crude oil reserves reflected market perceptions of weakening domestic demand to drive prices down.\n\nFurther price reductions are likely if US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data later on Wednesday shows an inventory drawdown against estimates of a stock rise.\n\nMeanwhile, the increasing value of the US dollar against other currencies, which rose by 0.12% to 105.54, curtailed the fall in prices by making oil expensive for other currency-holding traders.\n\nHowever, the escalating geopolitical tensions on the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing due to the Israeli attacks continue to influence oil prices.\n\nYemen's Houthi group threatened Tuesday to expand its attacks on shipping if the Israeli army invaded the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.\n\n\"The Israeli escalation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and their threat to invade Rafah will be met with a Yemeni response and the launching of the fourth round of escalation,\" Allama Muhammad Muftah, the chairman of the Houthi-run Supreme Committee for Supporting Al-Aqsa, told the Al-Masirah TV channel.\n\nThese developments are raising market fears that the conflict in the Middle East, the main oil-producing

US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 25c, or 0.32%, to $78.13 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell marginally in the previous session on signs of easing supply tightness and weaker global oil demand from an Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast report on Tuesday.\n\nUS crude stocks rose by 509,000 barrels in the week ended May 3, market sources said citing American Petroleum Institute (API) figures. Petrol and distillate fuel inventories also rose, they said.\n\n\"API numbers released overnight were moderately bearish due to stock builds in both crude and products.... Concern over weaker-than-usual US gasoline [petrol] demand and this stock-build have weighed on the prompt RBOB gasoline crack,\" said ING analysts in a client note.\n\nOfficial US government data on stockpiles is due at 2.30pm GMT. Analysts polled by Reuters expect US crude oil inventories to have fallen by about 1.1-million barrels last week.\n\nCautious expectations on supply cuts from oil cartel Opec and associates (Opec+) ahead of a June 1 policy meeting also weighed on markets.\n\n\"Oil prices have come under further pressure as noise around Opec+ production policy grows.... Expectations are that members will extend their additional voluntary supply cuts beyond the second quarter of this year,\" said ING analysts.\n\nMeanwhile, the hope of a ceasefire in Gaza have also put pressure on oil prices in recent sessions, with some analysts saying that the risk premium on oil declined in tandem.\n\n\"The fall in oil prices since Iran and Israel's back-and-forth attacks suggests that some of the risk premium in prices has now unwound,\" said economist Bill Weatherburn from Capital Economics in a client note.\n\n\"Prices continue to be supported by Opec+ production cuts but we suspect that members will gradually unwind these cuts from July, pushing oil prices lower,\" he said.\n\nThe US believes negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire should be able to close the gaps between Israel and Hamas. US Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns will travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nSome analyst expectations that short-term demand remains well supported, however, limited overall price declines.\n\n\"Much talk of economic run cuts in recent weeks is overblown in our opinion, with margins still healthy enough, which means rather that Asian demand could rather pick up once turnarounds peak and diminish,\" said Sparta Commodities analyst Neil Crosby.", "source":

Israel also decided to continue negotiations on the ceasefire deal.\n\nMarket reports said Israeli forces struck Rafah from the air and ground, and asked residents to leave parts of the city.

Meanwhile, market participants remained vigilant for any indications of de-escalation in the Middle East.\n\nBrent oil futures, set to expire in July, saw a 0.4 percent rise to reach $83.93 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased by 0.5 percent to $78.96 per barrel at 23:39 ET (03:39 GMT).\n\nRead more: Oil prices slide as U.S. inventories surge, demand weakens\n\nThe previous day, prices had risen slightly following data showing a decrease in overall crude inventories. However, the positive impact was offset by an increase in gasoline and distillate inventories.\n\nAdditionally, the strength of the dollar prevented significant gains in crude, as several Federal Reserve officials cautioned that interest rates would remain high for an extended period.\n\nAccording to government data released on Thursday, China's trade balance for April grew less than anticipated, particularly due to higher-than-expected imports.\n\nAlthough the surge in imports indicated improved domestic demand and resilience in the Chinese economy, the data revealed a decline in China's oil imports from 49.1 million tons in March to 44.7 million tons in April.\n\nThe import figure remained relatively unchanged compared to April 2023. These statistics suggest that demand in the world's largest crude importer may be cooling, despite an overall economic recovery.\n\nThe Chinese government's promotion of electric vehicle adoption and ongoing limitations on travel have likely contributed to this trend.\n\nNevertheless, travel is expected to increase in May with the Labor Day holiday, and Chinese refiners are anticipated to boost production in the upcoming summer months.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie predict that Brent prices will fall below $80 in the near future, citing bearish market fundamentals and a growing anticipation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFurthermore, increased production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) is expected to alleviate supply constraints, while persistently high inflation and long-term high interest rates are likely to dampen demand. However, any potential interest rate cuts later this year could help stimulate demand. The Macquarie analysts also noted that an extension of the ongoing production cuts by OPEC+ would provide relief to oil prices.", "source": {"uri": "economymiddleeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economy Middle East"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://economymiddleeast.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/Xfg_b7GtigYi5mxeAzkt9w/economymiddleeast.com/2024/05/Oil-prices-1-2.jpg/w=1024,h=682", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541796", "eventUri": "eng-9541796", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Middle East's unpredictability put pressure on Brent yesterday.\n\nAccording to market statistics, the closing price of ICE Brent crude dropped by 0.6% to $82.64 per barrel from $83.16 per barrel during the previous trading session. Additionally, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 0.64% from the previous session's closing price of $78.38 per barrel, trading at $77.88 per barrel at the same time.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) reported data late on Tuesday that showed US crude oil stocks had increased by 509,000 barrels, against the market's anticipation of a drawdown. This data helped to support oil prices.\n\nThe rise in commercial crude oil reserves reflected market perceptions of weakening domestic demand to drive prices down. Further price reductions are likely if US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data later on Wednesday shows a inventory drawdown against estimates of a stock rise.\n\nMeanwhile, the increasing value of the US dollar against other currencies, which rose by 0.12% to 105.54, curtailed the fall in prices by making oil expensive for other currency-holding traders.\n\nHowever, the escalating geopolitical tensions on the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing due to the Israeli attacks continue to influence oil prices. Yemen's Houthi group threatened Tuesday to expand its attacks on shipping if the Israeli army invaded the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli escalation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and their threat to invade Rafah will be met with a Yemeni response and the launching of the fourth round of escalation,' Allama Muhammad Muftah, the chairman of the Houthi-run Supreme Committee for Supporting Al-Aqsa, told the Al-Masirah TV channel.\n\nThese developments are raising market fears that the conflict in the Middle East, the main oil-producing region, could intensify and put upward pressure on prices.\n\nOil prices came under further pressure yesterday. ICE Brent briefly traded below US$83 and to its lowest level since mid-March, ING said in a note. A dampening factor was a report that Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said that OPEC+ was looking at the possibility of increasing oil output.\n\nHowever, Novak has since denied that the group is considering a potential increase in supply. Expectations are that members will extend their additional voluntary supply cuts beyond the second quarter of this year.\n\n\"Our oil balance suggests that there is no need for a full rollover of the 2.2m b/d of cuts. Instead, a partial rollover should be enough to keep the market balanced for the remainder of the year\", analysts sated.\n\nHowever, recent price action increases the risk that full cuts are rolled over, which in turn increases the risk of OPEC+ overtightening the oil market later in the year.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, API, numbers released overnight were moderately bearish due to stock builds in both crude and products. While US crude oil inventories are estimated to have increased by only 500k barrels over the week, gasoline and distillate stocks increased by 1.5m barrels and 1.7m barrels, respectively. In addition, crude oil stocks at the WTI delivery hub, cushing, grew by 1.3m barrels over the week.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest Short-Term Energy Outlook saw little change in US production estimates. The EIA forecasts that US crude oil output will grow by around 280k b/d year on year to a record 13.2m b/d in 2024, and then grow a further 520k b/d in 2025 to average 13.72m b/d.\n\nAccording to ING note, both estimates are essentially unchanged from the previous month's forecast. For natural gas, the EIA has revised its production estimates down for this year. Dry gas production is expected to fall 0.77bcf/day YoY to 103bcf/day in 2024, slightly less than last month's 103.59bcf/day forecast.\n\nING said low-price environment in the US and reduced drilling activity will be key reasons behind this expected slowdown. However, the EIA expects dry gas production to return to growth in 2025, growing by 1.78bcf/day to a record 104.78bcf/day. This supply growth will be price-dependent, analysts stated.", "source": {"uri": "bizwatchnigeria.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "BizWatchNigeria.Ng"}, "authors": [{"uri":

U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures rose 15 cents to $78.63 a barrel.\n\nEarlier, prices were about 1% lower, but they recovered after the U.S. government launched a solicitation to buy more than 3 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).\n\nWhile the SPR purchase put a bid in the market, the focus remained on U.S. oil storage reports due on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mizuho analyst Robert Yawger said.\n\n\"We need to see refiners running more barrels heading into peak summer driving season. If the inventories data goes in the wrong direction, the SPR and rest of it does not matter,\" Yawger said.\n\nU.S. crude oil and product stockpiles were expected to have fallen last week, a Reuters poll showed. Crude inventories could have fallen by about 1.2 million barrels in the week to May 3, based on analyst forecasts. [EIA/S]\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute will post its weekly U.S. oil and fuel inventories data after 4:30 p.m. ET, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly update on stockpiles is due on Wednesday.\n\nCurrent inventory data shows crude oil and petroleum supplies are running 1.1 million barrel per day above forecasts in countries that are part of the Organisation For Economic Co-operation and Development, according to an analysis by energy brokerage StoneX.\n\n\"Global inventories remain in a building phase and has accelerated recently,\" StoneX analyst Alex Hodes wrote to clients on Tuesday.\n\nOil traders largely looked past escalating tensions in the Middle East, where the Israeli military seized control of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt and its tanks pushed into the southern Gazan town of Rafah, as mediators struggled to secure a ceasefire agreement.\n\n\"Crude traders seem to have developed a higher tolerance for geopolitical risk in the Middle East and its potential to disrupt global oil supply,\" said Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at financial brokerage ActivTrades.\n\n\"Instead, their focus appears directed towards the uncertainties surrounding global economic growth prospects and the anticipated impact of sluggish growth on oil demand,\" Evangelista added.\n\nLast week, Brent and WTI had their steepest weekly losses in three months as weak U.S. jobs data fueled hopes for interest rate cuts.\n\n(Reporting by Shariq KhanAdditional reporting by Alex Lawler, Deep Vakil, Andrew Hayley and Jeslyn LerhEditing by

Oil prices are rising on the confusion surrounding ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, as well as reports of a potential Israeli invasion of Rafah. Ultimately, geopolitical tensions are propping up prices to kick off the trading week.\n\nJune West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose $0.43, or 0.55%, to $78.53 per barrel at 18:51 GMT on Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices are coming off a weekly loss of around 5% but are still up more than 10% year-to-date.\n\nBrent, the international benchmark for oil prices, firmed above $83 to start the trading week. July Brent crude futures jumped $0.40, or 0.48%, to $83.36 a barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange. Brent was down 4.5% last week, but the benchmark is still up 8.15% so far this year.\n\nReports are circulating that Hamas has ostensibly accepted a Gaza ceasefire from Egypt. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, reportedly confirmed to Egypt and Qatar that the group has given its \"approval of their proposal regarding a cease-fire agreement.\"\n\nIsrael has not issued a statement on the issue. However, according to Reuters, Israeli officials believe Hamas accepted a softened Egyptian proposal that is not acceptable to the government. In other words, it was a framework that was agreed upon by both sides.\n\nThis comes after it was reported that the Israel Defense Forces told tens of thousands of Palestinians to leave the southern Gaza city of Rafah. This comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country will not concede to international pressure.\n\n\"If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone,\" Netanyahu said in a speech. \"And I say to you, we will defeat our genocidal enemies. Never again is now.\"\n\nOil prices have come under tremendous pressure in recent sessions as traders diminished the war risk premium. Crude futures further slumped on a bearish build in domestic oil stockpiles.\n\nDemand does not appear to be an issue for investors right now after the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) remained in positive territory and suggests China could still maintain heavy imports of oil.\n\nAt the same time, Saudi Aramco announced that it would be raising crude prices for markets in Asia, Northwest Europe, and the Mediterranean.\n\nIn other energy commodities, June natural gas futures tacked on $0.057, or 2.66%, to $2.199 per million British thermal units (Btu).

Chinese refiners are also expected to increase output in the coming summer months.\n\nOil prices more likely to dip below $80 than rise above $90- Macquarie\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie said they expected Brent to break below $80 in the coming months, citing \"bearish fundamentals\" and increasing expectations of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n\nIncreased production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) is also expected to factor into less tighter supplies, while sticky inflation and high for longer interest rates are likely to weigh on demand.\n\nStill, any potential interest rate cuts could help buoy demand later this year. Macquarie analysts also said that any extension of ongoing production cuts by the OPEC+ will offer relief to oil prices.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541796", "eventUri": "eng-9541796", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The US benchmark crude is +0.12% up hovering around 79.00$ per barrel and Brent is trading is also +0.16% up trading at $82.91 per barrel, at the time of writing.\n\nIn recent trading sessions, oil prices have exhibited volatility, with intraday losses nearly erased following the Energy Information Administration (EIA) release. Let's delve into the key factors driving these fluctuations:\n\nIran's Output Plans:\n\nIran's announcement of plans to increase its daily oil output by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels this year has introduced uncertainty. Market participants are closely monitoring this development, as it may impact the upcoming OPEC meeting where production cuts are on the agenda. If Iran significantly ramps up production, it could affect global oil supply and prices.\n\nUS Dollar's Influence:\n\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has posted gains for three consecutive days, exerting influence on oil prices. A stronger dollar tends to put downward pressure on commodities priced in USD, including crude oil. Traders are closely watching the DXY's movements and assessing its impact on the oil market.\n\nCrude Stockpile Figures:\n\nThis week's EIA report revealed a drawdown of 1.326 million barrels in crude stockpiles. In contrast, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 509,000-barrel increase in US crude inventories for the week ending May 3. These inventory levels provide insights into supply dynamics and can sway market sentiment.\n\nBalanced Oil Market for 2024:\n\nThe EIA's note emphasized that the oil market remains balanced for 2024. Non-OPEC countries are stepping in to fill the gap left by OPEC's production cuts. As global demand recovers from pandemic-related disruptions, maintaining this delicate balance will be crucial for price stability.\n\nMiddle East Risks, Price Expectations:\n\nDespite geopolitical tensions, actual interruptions in oil production from the Middle East have not materialized. Traders appear frustrated with pricing in a risk premium for an event that has yet to occur. However, a potential turnaround could occur if oil prices recover above $78.07, this has already happened during the American session. The 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the green ascending trend line provide technical support levels to watch.\n\nIn summary, market uncertainty, the US Dollar's strength, inventory data, and geopolitical risks all play a role in shaping oil prices. Traders will closely monitor these factors as they navigate the complex landscape of the energy market.\n\nSaid, Mohamed Hashad: chief market strategist at Noor capital, Investors always need to stay informed about developments in the oil sector, keep an eye on technical levels, global economic factors, and geopolitical events that could impact oil prices in the coming days. Remember, the oil market is dynamic, and unexpected events can significantly influence prices.\n\nOPEC's Plans and Intentions in May 2024:\n\nOn November 30, 2023, OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, agreed to cut oil production by 1 million barrels per day (bpd). This decision aimed to stabilize oil prices and manage supply in response to market dynamics.\n\nMonthly Oil Market Report (MOMR):\n\nOPEC's Monthly Oil Market Report provides a detailed analysis of key developments impacting oil market trends. It covers world oil demand, supply, and the oil market balance for the coming year. The report is a valuable resource for understanding OPEC's outlook and assessing market conditions.\n\nIt is worth noting that crude oil prices have increased by almost $6.96 per barrel or 9.72% since the beginning of 2024. Geopolitical events, supply-demand dynamics, and economic growth projections play a significant role in shaping oil prices.", "source": {"uri": "mid-east.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-east.info"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rizza_pawaon@mid-east.info", "name": "Rizza Pawaon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(crude_oil)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (crude oil)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Petroleum Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/mid-east.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mohamed-Hashad-Chief-Market-Strategist-Noor-Capital_Landscape-1-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541796", "eventUri": "eng-9541796", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1573, "textEnd": 1578}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The decrease of 1.361 million barrels fell slightly short of market expectations, leading to a tempered market response. However, reports suggesting potential discussions within OPEC+ about increasing crude production contributed to a drop in crude oil prices during trading. Meanwhile, the US Energy Department's announcement of plans to purchase up to 3.3 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) highlighted ongoing efforts to replenish reserves, which were depleted following President Biden's directive for a significant sale of 180 million barrels after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to halt oil purchases for the reserve reflects crude oil prices consistently trading above the desired price threshold. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revised its forecasts, anticipating slower growth in global oil demand compared to earlier projections. The agency attributed this adjustment to increased output from regions outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and decreased demand from developed economies. Despite the slight downward revision, the EIA maintains expectations for growth in oil consumption this year.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the market observed short covering, with a decrease in open interest and a modest increase in prices.

One major catalyst has been the decline in U.S. crude oil inventories, which fell by 1.4 million barrels last week, surpassing expectations of a 1.0 million barrel decrease, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nThis decline has provided support for crude oil prices, helping them rebound from their recent lows.\n\nAdditionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have contributed to the recovery in crude oil prices.\n\nHowever, gains have been tempered by factors such as the strengthening of the dollar index and diminishing hopes of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nDespite these headwinds, crude oil prices have managed to recover sharply from their three-month low levels.\n\n\"Given the problems associated with imputing the per barrel costs from different sources (owing to different densities across crude varieties), we have looked at the imputed unit value of such imports in $/tonne. Interestingly, the imputed unit value for imports from Russia (on an annual basis) was 16.4% and 15.6% lower than the corresponding levels from West Asia during FY2023 and 11M FY2024, respectively, which contrasts with the trends observed during FY2019-21, when the former had exceeded the latter, providing an estimate of the discounts on imports from Russia in the last two fiscals\" ICRA said in report.\n\nWTI crude, for instance, bounced back from lows of $76.91 to settle up by 0.8% at $78.99 a barrel.\n\nThe recent correction in prices can be attributed in part to hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza, which have exerted downward pressure on oil prices in recent trading sessions and diminished risk premiums.\n\nIn terms of inventory data, U.S. weekly crude inventories fell to 459.5 million barrels last week, while refinery utilisation rates rose to 88.5% of total capacity. Despite this increase, utilisation rates remain lower compared to a year ago.\n\nMoreover, gasoline demand has shown signs of weakness, indicating subdued activity at gas stations. Distillates also experienced a buildup, further influencing market dynamics.\n\n\"This is estimated to have led to savings amounting to $5.1 billion in India's oil import bill in FY2023 (0.15% of GDP), amounting to 3.1% of India's crude petroleum imports during that fiscal,\" ICRA reports. Accordingly, if the average crude oil price rises to $95/bbl in FY2025, then the CAD is likely to widen to 1.5% of GDP from our current estimate of 1.2% of GDP. However, this would still be lower than the levels seen in FY2023 (2.0% of GDP), as tepid demand may keep a lid on the prices of other commodities,\" ICRA added in the report.\n\nLooking ahead, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) has revised its outlook for global oil and liquid fuel demand, projecting a growth of 920,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year to 102.84 million bpd. Total world crude oil and liquid fuel production is expected to rise by 970,000 bpd to 102.76 million bpd in 2024.\n\nThe United States is anticipated to maintain its position as the leading crude oil producer, with production levels hovering around 13.20 million bpd.\n\nIn the context of India, crude oil consumption has shown a year-on-year increase, reaching 19.86 million tonnes, or 4.85 million barrels per day, in April 2024.\n\nHowever, there was a month-on-month decline of 5.8%, with fuel oil usage dropping by more than 16% compared to April 2023. Despite these fluctuations, India's economic growth is expected to remain robust at 6.5% in 2024, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing economies globally.\n\nLooking forward, crude oil markets are likely to experience continued volatility. While prices have corrected by around 10% over the past five weeks, prompting some U.S. drillers to consider scaling back production in shale basins, geopolitical risks persist.\n\nUncertainties surrounding the Gaza-Israel conflict and the potential for escalation in Rafah could further influence market sentiment.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, crude oil's 100-day moving average currently sits at $78.22, with prices settling above this level on Wednesday.\n\nThe next key target is the 200-day moving average at $80.06. Overall, crude oil prices are expected to trade with an upward bias in the range of $77 to $80 per barrel, with the possibility of WTI crude testing the $80-mark in the near term.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe views and financial advice provided by investment professionals on Goodreturns.in are personal and do not necessarily reflect those of the website or its management.

However, the broader weakness in the market will likely add further noise around OPEC+ output policy ahead of the next Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting. OPEC+ members will also become uncomfortable if Brent starts flirting with $80/bbl, a level that is not too far away. As we have mentioned previously, price weakness increases the likelihood that OPEC+ members will fully rollover their 2.2m b/d of additional voluntary cuts into the second half of the year, which risks overtightening the market later in 2024, assuming no downside surprises on the demand side.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly inventory report aided the recovery in oil prices yesterday, which contradicted previously released API crude oil inventory numbers. EIA data shows that US commercial crude oil inventories fell by 1.36m barrels over the last week, different to the 500k barrel build the API reported. The decline in crude oil stocks was driven by stronger exports, which increased by 550kk b/d WoW to 4.47m b/d, and stronger refinery activity. Refinery run rates increased by 1pp over the week to 88.5%, which saw crude oil inputs grow 307k b/d WoW. Stronger refinery activity meant gasoline and distillate inventories increased by 915k barrels and 560k barrels respectively, which were still lower than the builds the API reported this week. A recent concern for the oil market has been weaker than usual US gasoline demand. While demand increased over the week, the 4-week average implied gasoline demand is still at its lowest level since 2014 for this stage of the year at 8.63m b/d (excluding 2020 due to COVID). Concerns over gasoline demand have seen the prompt RBOB gasoline crack trade to its lowest level since February.\n\nIn Asia, weaker refinery margins will also be a concern and in recent weeks there have been reports of some refiners in the region cutting or set to cut run rates given the weakness. There will probably not be any respite for margins in the short term, particularly after China recently released its second batch of refined product export quotas for the year, totaling 14m tonnes. This takes total quota releases for 2024 to 33m tonnes, 18% higher than the first two batches of last year.\n\nThe US Department of Energy (DoE) is looking to purchase up to 3.3m barrels of US sour crude oil for delivery in October 2024, at a price no higher than $79.99/bbl.

June's natural gas production will average 102 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d), down 4% from the monthly record set in December 2023.\n\n\"Some producers have announced curtailments in production or reductions in upstream spending on natural gas-directed activities this year,\" EIA administrator Joe DeCarolis said in March. \"But with so much domestic natural gas production tied to growing crude oil production, we expect natural gas production to decrease far more slowly than prices have.\"\n\nAccording to the report, dry natural gas production in the US will fall by 1% this year compared with last year, before rising by 2% in 2025 to a record of almost 105bcf/d.\n\n\"The increase in production next year is the result of our forecast of rising natural gas prices, which will create an incentive for more drilling in dry natural gas production regions,\" the report reads.\n\nThe agency has estimated that domestic gas consumption will increase from the current record of 89.10bcf/d in 2023 to 89.31bcf/d in 2024, and 89.64bcf/d in 2025.\n\nIf the projections turn out to be correct, it would be the first time demand has declined since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 cut fuel demand.\n\nNatural gas emissions are expected to increase by 1% in 2024, primarily due to greater natural gas-fired power production in Q1 2024 and higher consumption in the residential and commercial sectors in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, petroleum emissions are projected to remain relatively stable throughout the year.", "source": {"uri": "offshore-technology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Offshore Technology"}, "authors": [{"uri": "smruthi_nadig@offshore-technology.com", "name": "Smruthi Nadig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/05/GettyImages-71446098.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541796", "eventUri": "eng-9541796", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 2051, "textEnd": 2056}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Previous studies indicate that certain conditions must be met to ensure that the commencement of these refineries leads to significant economic growth, job creation, reduced imports, and other anticipated economic and business advantages.\"\n\n\"These conditions encompass factors such as regulatory reforms, infrastructure development, investment in human capital, technological advancement, and market liberalisation. Without addressing these underlying challenges and implementing necessary reforms, the reactivation of the midstream segment may fall short of its potential to drive transformative change in Nigeria's oil and gas industry and foster sustainable economic development.\"\n\n\"Failure to position Nigeria to capitalise on these opportunities by sticking to the status quo, the country would risk allowing other emerging economies to exploit them to fuel their economic growth process. A pertinent example is the recent export of Naphtha by the Dangote Refinery to industrial complexes in Asia with Nigeria as a principal destination for goods produced using inputs sourced from the country.\"\n\nFurthermore, the report highlighted that the absence of industries capable of utilizing all the refinery's products significantly reduces the socioeconomic benefits Nigeria could have gained from local refining. Refiners are limited to selling specific products domestically while exporting other by-products. The finished goods made from these by-products are then imported back into the country.\n\nThe report further emphasized that Nigeria may not experience substantial economic growth solely through local crude oil refining, as the prices of petrol and diesel are likely to remain high due to structural challenges in the sector, such as crude oil theft, which results in limited crude oil supply.\n\nTo ensure the country does not lose out on the socioeconomic benefits of local crude oil refining, the NESG called on the federal government to ensure adequate crude oil supply which will reduce import and domestic crude oil pricing for local refiners to catalyse the allied benefits of local refining.\n\nHowever, they noted that the tradeoff for prioritising crude oil supply to local refiners would mean reduced earnings from crude oil sale for the government.\n\nOn pricing, they stated that contrary to expectations of the populace on reduced prices of petroleum products due to local refining, petrol prices would remain high as current refiners such as Dangote are importing crude oil.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"},

ICE (NYSE:ICE) Brent briefly traded below US$83/bbl and to its lowest level since mid-March. A dampening factor was a report that Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said that OPEC+ was looking at the possibility of increasing oil output. However, Novak has since denied that the group is considering a potential increase in supply. Expectations are that members will extend their additional voluntary supply cuts beyond the second quarter of this year. Our oil balance suggests that there is no need for a full rollover of the 2.2m b/d of cuts. Instead, a partial rollover should be enough to keep the market balanced for the remainder of the year. However, recent price action increases the risk that full cuts are rolled over, which in turn increases the risk of OPEC+ overtightening the oil market later in the year.\n\nAPI numbers released overnight were moderately bearish due to stock builds in both crude and products. While US crude oil inventories are estimated to have increased by only 500k barrels over the week, gasoline and distillate stocks increased by 1.5m barrels and 1.7m barrels respectively. In addition, crude oil stocks at the WTI delivery hub, Cushing, grew by 1.3m barrels over the week. Concern over weaker-than-usual US gasoline demand and this stock-build have weighed on the prompt RBOB gasoline crack, which has fallen below US$29/bbl, from more than US$33/bbl in mid-April.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest Short-Term Energy Outlook saw little change in US production estimates. The EIA forecasts that US crude oil output will grow by around 280k b/d YoY to a record 13.2m b/d in 2024, and then grow a further 520k b/d in 2025 to average 13.72m b/d. Both estimates are essentially unchanged from the previous month's forecast. For natural gas, the EIA has revised its production estimates down for this year. Dry gas production is expected to fall 0.77bcf/day YoY to 103bcf/day in 2024, slightly less than last month's 103.59bcf/day forecast.

ICE Brent briefly traded below US$83/bbl and to its lowest level since mid-March. A dampening factor was a report that Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said that OPEC+ was looking at the possibility of increasing oil output. However, Novak has since denied that the group is considering a potential increase in supply. Expectations are that members will extend their additional voluntary supply cuts beyond the second quarter of this year. Our oil balance suggests that there is no need for a full rollover of the 2.2m b/d of cuts. Instead, a partial rollover should be enough to keep the market balanced for the remainder of the year. However, recent price action increases the risk that full cuts are rolled over, which in turn increases the risk of OPEC+ overtightening the oil market later in the year.\n\nAPI numbers released overnight were moderately bearish due to stock builds in both crude and products. While US crude oil inventories are estimated to have increased by only 500k barrels over the week, gasoline and distillate stocks increased by 1.5m barrels and 1.7m barrels respectively. In addition, crude oil stocks at the WTI delivery hub, Cushing, grew by 1.3m barrels over the week. Concern over weaker-than-usual US gasoline demand and this stock-build have weighed on the prompt RBOB gasoline crack, which has fallen below US$29/bbl, from more than US$33/bbl in mid-April.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest Short-Term Energy Outlook saw little change in US production estimates. The EIA forecasts that US crude oil output will grow by around 280k b/d YoY to a record 13.2m b/d in 2024, and then grow a further 520k b/d in 2025 to average 13.72m b/d. Both estimates are essentially unchanged from the previous month's forecast. For natural gas, the EIA has revised its production estimates down for this year. Dry gas production is expected to fall 0.77bcf/day YoY to 103bcf/day in 2024, slightly less than last month's 103.59bcf/day forecast. The low-price environment in the US and reduced drilling activity will be key reasons behind this expected slowdown. However, the EIA expects dry gas production to return to growth in 2025, growing by 1.78bcf/day YoY to a record 104.78bcf/day. This supply growth will be price-dependent. This latest release reinforces our view that US natural gas prices have likely bottomed and should trend higher from current levels.\n\nMetals - China's gold buying continues\n\nChina's central bank expanded its gold reserves for an 18th straight month in April adding 1.87 tonnes and taking its total holdings to 2,264.3 tonnes. However, the pace of buying slowed last month amid record gold prices. Gold demand from central banks posted its strongest start to any year on record in the first quarter. Central banks added 290 tonnes of gold to their official holdings in the quarter. China was the biggest buyer according to data from the World Gold Council. Gold hit an all-time high above $2,400/oz in April after a rally underpinned by strong demand from central banks and rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nAgriculture - Robusta coffee declines on better supply prospects\n\nRobusta coffee prices extended losses for a seventh consecutive session yesterday on prospects of improving weather conditions this week in major producer Vietnam. Cumulative coffee exports from Vietnam increased by 5.4% YoY to 756kt in the first four months of 2024. Similarly, the International Coffee Organization (ICO) reported that global robusta coffee exports rose 6% YoY to 5.6m bags in March. The spread between Robusta and the higher-quality Arabica coffee has also tightened, reflecting less concern over robusta supply.\n\nVolatility continues in the cocoa market. After London cocoa prices fell almost 20% last week amid lower liquidity, prices rallied more than 7% yesterday, leaving them just shy of GBP8,000/t. This volatility is likely to continue due to reduced liquidity and concern over market tightness. Farmers in the key producer, Ivory Coast, have delivered around 1.37mt of cocoa to ports so far this season, down from around 1.97mt over the same period last season.\n\nSource: ING, https://think.ing.com/articles/the-commodities-feed-oil-remains-under-pressure080524/", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Novak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Novak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Petroleum Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffea canephora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffea arabica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541796", "eventUri": "eng-9541796", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1}

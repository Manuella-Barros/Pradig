{"id": 225048066, "title": "The unlikely women fighting for abortion rights", "text": "For a long time, many women who had abortions because of catastrophic fetal diagnoses told their stories only privately. Grieving pregnancies they dearly wanted and fearing the stigma of abortion, they sought the closely guarded comfort of online communities identified by the way many doctors had described the procedure \u2014 TFMR, or \u201ctermination for medical reasons.\u201dIn the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, their pain has been compounded into anger by new abortion bans across the country. Although these women account for a fraction of abortions in the United States, they have emerged as the most powerful voices in the nation\u2019s post-Roe debate, speaking out against bans with their stories of being forced across state lines and left to feel like criminals in seeking care.Many of these women started out opposing abortion, but as they have changed their minds, they have changed the way Americans speak about it. Shifting from private anguish to public outrage, they have also helped shift public opinion toward more support for abortion.\u201cAfter going through all this, I wondered, why are we not the poster child for abortion rights?\u201d said Riata Little Walker, who traveled from her home in Casper, Wyoming, for an abortion in Colorado at 22 weeks, after doctors diagnosed Down syndrome and a heart defect in her fetus, which they said would require surgery and later a transplant if it survived until delivery.\u201cYes, your body, your choice, but that\u2019s not the story that pulls people in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to bring our stories to the front because otherwise it\u2019s so easy for those over here to do, \u2018But they\u2019re killing babies.\u2019\u201dWalker is Catholic and had worked for Wyoming Republicans, including US Sen. John Barrasso. She opposed abortion and did not realize she was having one because doctors called it \u201ctermination.\u201d In the months that followed, she came to support abortion whatever the reason, and after Roe was overturned in June 2022, she testified against the ban on abortion passed by the Wyoming Legislature.Although most bans allow abortions to save the life or health of the pregnant woman, few women have been granted these exceptions, and only a handful of bans allow abortions for fatal fetal anomalies. There are no bright lines to define \u201cfatal\u201d or \u201cmedical reason,\u201d and the procedure is the same whether it\u2019s described as termination, TFMR or abortion.That makes these cases complicated for doctors, lawmakers and for the women themselves: What qualifies as a medical reason?The women speaking out say their experiences made them believe that the law can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t try to address complex and endlessly varying medical cases. In this, they appeal to rare common ground in what has been a bitter, decades-long debate: Regardless of whether they identify as \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice\u201d in polls, Americans overwhelmingly say that the decision to have an abortion should be up to women and doctors, not the government.These women say they now feel compelled not only to speak out but also to use the word \u201cabortion,\u201d to remove the stigma they themselves put on it.\u201cAll these things we never even knew before; because before all of this, it was never spoken about,\u201d said Kimberly Manzano, who flew from Texas for an abortion in New Mexico at 18 weeks after scans showed her fetus was missing limbs, organs and genitalia.Manzano describes herself and her husband as \u201cbig Christians,\u201d who thought abortion was something \u201cpromiscuous women\u201d did to end unwanted pregnancies. Their pastor assumed they would qualify as a medical exception to Texas\u2019 ban. They did not. Megan Kling talks with her daughter Greta, 4, at their family farm in Taylor, Wis., on May 1, 2024. She had to travel out of state for an abortion because the fetus she was carrying had no kidneys. (Andy Manis/The New York Times)\u201cWe feel it\u2019s our calling to our child that we lost that we do need to talk about it, to educate people, because I feel that we were so uneducated,\u201d she said.Some of the women are appearing in ads in favor of abortion rights ballot measures or candidates. Others are confronting politicians on the campaign trail, testifying or joining lawsuits. But mostly, they are talking to friends, family members and colleagues.Polls show that people who have heard stories about women who had to cross state lines for abortions because of severe pregnancy complications are more likely to support legalized abortion. That is true even for Republicans or those who think that abortion should be illegal in most cases. Stories like these have also moved voters who oppose abortion to support ballot measures that have enshrined broad abortion rights in conservative states such as Ohio and Kansas.\u201cBy telling people\u2019s stories, it makes it reality,\u201d said Megan Kling, who traveled from her home in Wisconsin to Minnesota for an abortion at 23 weeks after a scan revealed that her fetus had no kidneys, so was not creating amniotic fluid, and would die after delivery, if not in utero. \u201cYou want to think every woman is perfectly healthy, every pregnancy is perfectly healthy, when in reality there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong.\u201dKling said some family members have argued that her situation is different: They support abortion if the fetus has a devastating condition, but they just don\u2019t want women using it as birth control. She understands, because she never thought of herself as someone who would choose abortion. \u201cBut women need health care options, and that\u2019s what they don\u2019t understand: Abortion is health care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what these stories raise up.\u201dResearchers say it\u2019s not clear how many of the roughly 1 million abortions each year in the United States would be considered \u201cfor medical reasons\u201d but that they are rare. Ashley Brandt holds her 17-month-old daughter Marley, the surviving twin, at their home in Frisco, Texas, on April 30, 2024. The end of Roe has turned women who terminated pregnancies for medical reasons into a political force. (Shelby Tauber/The New York Times)Still, TFMR or \u201cending wanted pregnancy\u201d communities have flourished online, with websites, private groups on social media where thousands of women share their stories \u2014 and separate sites for their partners \u2014 as well as podcasts and psychotherapists devoted solely to TFMR, and an awareness day in early May.Many of these women don\u2019t fit the usual angles of the abortion debate. They bristle at the clinical language of abortion rights groups; instead of \u201cfetus,\u201d they speak of the pregnancies they lost as unborn children. They name them, mark birthdays and imprint their tiny feet on keepsakes.Kling found herself in an awkward position after she wrote letters to her state legislators, including the Republicans who represent her, in an attempt to move beyond her grief and anger after losing her pregnancy. She heard back only from a Democrat, and later, from Planned Parenthood and other groups who asked her to speak at events in support of President Joe Biden. She agreed but explained that she did not necessarily support him. She doesn\u2019t think of herself as a Democrat, but she doesn\u2019t feel like a Republican anymore, either.\u201cI feel like most people feel that way,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the extremists are so loud, you almost feel like you can\u2019t speak up.\u201dAnti-abortion groups argue that bans prohibit only what they call \u201celective abortions\u201d for unwanted pregnancies and that any woman who needs an abortion for medical reasons can get one under the exceptions in those bans. They accuse Democrats of manipulating medical patients for political ends.\u201cWomen have been falsely told this is a compassionate option. However, it feeds into the growing trend of disability discrimination and the pressure women face from the medical community to abort children who might have a disability,\u201d said Dr. Ingrid Skop of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.On the other side, abortion rights groups fear that elevating TFMR stories promotes the message that abortion should be protected only if it is \u201cjustified,\u201d not that it should be every woman\u2019s right. \u201cPeople need abortions for all kinds of reasons \u2014 financial, medical, life circumstances \u2014 and none should be stigmatized,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Riata Little Walker shows a photo book of her daughter whose doctors called for a termination of the pregnancy because of medical reasons, in Casper, Wyo., on May 2, 2024. Like many families who terminate for medical reasons, the Walkers named the pregnancy they aborted, a daughter, and made mementos including a photo book to preserve their memories of her. (Jimena Peck/The New York Times)Even within online communities, there is debate: Is it acceptable to terminate if a child would live only a few hours? A few days? A few years? What about the \u201cgray\u201d diagnoses \u2014 in which a fetus is likely to survive into childhood but live a life severely constrained by surgeries, medications, machinery and hospitalizations?Women describe weeks of waiting for additional scans, hoping for miracles, poring over statistics on survival rates and research on quality of life. Some elect to continue their pregnancies.\u201cTheoretically, if I had a Down syndrome diagnosis, I would keep them,\u201d said Martha Sheppard. She and her husband, a teacher, learned on a 20-week anatomy scan that their daughter\u2019s spine had not fused \u2014 the diagnosis was spina bifida \u2014 and would require an unknown number of surgeries, the first in utero. They moved from their home in Virginia to a Ronald McDonald House near a hospital in North Carolina for further tests and researched. Three weeks later, they decided to terminate.\u201cTo keep a child with spina bifida is also a loving decision,\u201d Sheppard said, \u201cbut my husband and I decided that it was a loving decision not to bring her into the world with the body that she had.\u201dThe women might seem to be making the case for medical exceptions \u2014 dozens have joined lawsuits filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights in four states, seeking to clarify what conditions qualify as exceptions under abortion bans. Instead, \u201cExceptions don\u2019t work, is what we\u2019re proving,\u201d said Ashley Brandt, a plaintiff in Texas.Brandt traveled to Colorado to abort a twin that had acrania \u2014 it had no skull \u2014 and posed a threat to her other fetus. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me at risk; it was my viable daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still were not an exception.\u201d Riata Little Walker, right, with her husband, Ian Walker, and their family in Casper, Wyo., on May 2, 2024. The end of Roe has turned women who terminated pregnancies for medical reasons into a political force. (Jimena Peck/The New York Times)She learned of the option to selectively abort only from a TFMR group online; her doctors had been afraid to mention termination for fear of prosecution. She saw the shame and isolation that women in those groups felt, and felt it herself. Some of the harshest comments, Brandt said, came from women struggling with infertility who cannot imagine choosing to end any pregnancy. Like many of the women now telling their stories in public, she said her experience has made her feel more compassion for women who choose abortion no matter what the reason.\u201cPicking and choosing, it has to stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to trust people to make their own decisions.\u201dBut the women say it remains a fight simply to explain that what they had was an abortion.Months after Manzano\u2019s abortion, she noticed her doctor had recorded it as \u201cspontaneous miscarriage\u201d on her chart.\u201cWe had to travel to New Mexico,\u201d Manzano said. \u201cThere was nothing spontaneous about it.\u201dShe has been seeing a grief counselor, who refers to it as her \u201cmedical miscarriage,\u201d even after Manzano told him she prefers to say \u201cabortion.\u201d\u201cNeither one of us corrects the other,\u201d she said. Still, \u201cfor me to be able to grieve and heal through the process, I have to be able to say what it is.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/unlikely-women-fighting-for-abortion-rights-9359626/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Abortion-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:12:08", "author": "New York Times", "authors": ["New York Times"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.151}

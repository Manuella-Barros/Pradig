The Light Blues announced five players would be leaving the club following the expiry of their contracts with the hitman - injury plagued through his time in Glasgow - joining Borna Barisic, John Lundstram, Jon McLaughlin and Ryan Jack in heading for the exit door and now on the lookout for a fresh challenge. Philippe Clement is ready to kick off another summer rebuild with the quintet not needed by the Belgian. Roofe arrived in Govan under Steven Gerrard in a big money move from Anderlecht. This campaign he only managed 24 appearances across all competitions and found the back of the net twice. Most of those minutes came as cameos from the bench due to his ongoing fitness struggles. Taking to social media, he wrote: \"It\u2019s my turn to hand back the 25 jersey after four years at this special club! The video showcases the memorable moments on the pitch but I\u2019ve made friendships for life off the pitch too. I\u2019m officially a fan of @rangersfc now. Thank you Gers for having me.\" The video montage showcased his most memorable moments from the time he first arrived in Glasgow to THAT stunning Europa League halfway line goal against Standard Liege with then boss Steven Gerrard doing a voice over of the clip. His shared footage also showed off strikes against Celtic and the crucial goal against Real Betis in Seville that booked top spot and qualification to the knockout round for Clement and his troops amongst other key moments in his Ibrox career. Fans showed their appreciation to Roofe in the comments with one writing: \"Fired us to 55 and one of the greatest Rangers goals of all time.\" Another posted: \"Fantastic player. Thank you for everything you did for the club!!\" while a further supporter added: \"Thanks for all your effort and good luck for the future.\" It wasn't just supporters who left well wishes with past colleagues chipping in. Andy Firth said: \"All the best Kem.\" while Cedric Itten also left a three word comment which read: \"Well done bro.\"", "summary": "The hitman was one of the big names to leave with his contract up including Borna Barisic, John Lundstram and Ryan Jack.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/kemar-roofe-hails-special-rangers-32989680", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32989777.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS309005003.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:32:34", "author": "Alan Galindo", "authors": ["Alan Galindo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.552}

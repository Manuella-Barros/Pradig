Terrence Cook, 88, took a stand against council highway workers who were attempting to install the speed limit signs on his lane in Trinant, Caerphilly borough, saying he has no regrets about his dispute with the council and hopes they will reconsider their decision. Horeb Lane, where Mr Cook resides, is a typical country lane, narrow and winding with poor visibility. During a drive down the lane, Mr Cook pointed out how easy it would be for two vehicles to collide or for a pedestrian to be hit if drivers were to speed. Despite this, the bridle path is a national speed limit route and last week, the council arrived to erect national speed limit signs, Wales Online reports. Upon seeing the council worker with the signs, Terrence quickly reversed his car from his driveway, blocking the worker from entering the lane with the sign. He stated he was prepared to be arrested over the matter and has since been in dispute with the council. A spokesperson for Caerphilly council clarified that Horeb Lane has always been a national speed limit route, despite signs indicating a 20mph limit. It appears someone had manipulated the 20mph signs to make it seem as though the speed limit was lower than it actually is, reports Wales Online. These signs are meant for the road heading in the opposite direction. A council worker has since visited the site to correct the positioning of the signs. Terrence insists he didn't tamper with the signs and is clueless about who did, but points out it highlights the community's worries about speeding in the country lane. He believes numerous crashes on the lane have been due to drivers exceeding 20mph. \"It is a challenging lane to drive, a typical country lane, and in no circumstances should people be driving at high speeds on the road,\" he said. \"I have to reverse my car around a corner on the road. I've had to put a traffic cone out because of how quickly cars come down here and they come down so fast that before they've seen the cone it's underneath their car. I'm very worried that with the national speed limit sign it would encourage motorists to drive quickly.\" \"I've tried to challenge this on my own and feel I've not got anywhere so I need to make what is happening here public knowledge. It's bizarre to me that a council would want to fund the installation of a national speed limit sign on a road where it's clearly dangerous. I have lived here for 42 years and I've seen it all. Dogs getting knocked over, a little girl got hit on a horse and went over.\" Terrence, distressed about cars whizzing too fast past his home, has taken matters into his own hands by creating a DIY 'Go Slow' sign. He confessed: \"I think generally it works, although sometimes people tell me to go to hell. Most people are respectful but it only takes one for a serious accident. No way can people be driving 70mph. I'm horrified by this. There are stables up on the right hand side and people are riding up and down here all the time, people use it as a walking route. It's incredibly dangerous.\" In response, a representative from the council explained: \"Sections of road within Trinant village have been reduced to 20mph but this lane has always been subject to the national speed limit. As part of the associated signage works for the new 20mph speed limits we identified that national speed limit signs were missing from the junction with this lane and need to be provided. We have spoken to Mr Cook and advised him of the position and the national speed limit sign will need to be installed at this site.\"", "summary": "Terrence Cook, of Horeb Lane in Trinant, Caerphilly borough, claimed he would be ready to be arrested over the matter and said he has since been in dispute with the council", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pensioner-88-blocks-road-car-32942701", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article32942698.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2090524terrencecook_02.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:29:01", "author": "Jonathon Hill", "authors": ["Jonathon Hill"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.105}

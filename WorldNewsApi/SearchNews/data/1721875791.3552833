(Bandai Namco) A reader is frustrated by FromSoftware\u2019s approach to storytelling and explains why he\u2019s not playing new release Shadow Of The Erdtree. Shadow Of The Erdtree is out this week and I\u2019m really not sure I\u2019m going to get it. It\u2019s had amazing reviews and I definitely enjoyed parts of Elden Ring, but I also found other parts extremely irritating, namely the storytelling. I have no idea what was going on in the game and speaking to others it\u2019s clear I\u2019m not the only one. It\u2019s so bad it\u2019s put me off playing any of From\u2019s other games and the DLC. For those that don\u2019t know, there is very little in the way of cut scenes or plot in Elden Ring. There\u2019s an intro, that\u2019s basically a fantasy world word salad, and some dialogue with characters but none of it is given any context and you\u2019re left to work out what\u2019s going on by reading item descriptions, of all things. These still don\u2019t make it clear though and after reading about how involved the fan community is I started reading wikis and watching YouTube videos. As interesting as it all was there\u2019s still no real consensus as to what\u2019s going on, with everything described as \u2018possibly meaning this\u2019 or \u2018maybe meaning that.\u2019 The thing that gets me is that it\u2019s not even really clear what the Elden Ring is. Not only that but it\u2019s not even presented as a secret or some amazing reveal, it\u2019s just this ambiguous magic object that can do\u2026 things. Why you want to be the Elden Lord is never explained, who you are is never explained, it\u2019s not even made clear what a tarnished is. I find this frustrating but what\u2019s worse is that it\u2019s all information the character you\u2019re playing as would know. It isn\u2019t a mystery to them, only to you the player. Other things in the game are a mystery, sure, but not the basics of what\u2019s going on and what your mission is. Things get even worse if you\u2019re trying to do some of the side quests, where you might as well make up your own story for all the difference it\u2019ll make. Again, I read the supposed explanations and I\u2019m both none the wiser and I have no idea how they make some of their deductions. It doesn\u2019t affect the gameplay, sure, and I\u2019m not someone that demands complex stories in all my games. If it\u2019s a straight action game, I don\u2019t want to be stopping all the time for 10 minute long cut scenes. But that\u2019s not what Elden Ring is like. There is some really complex lore there, but the game won\u2019t explain any of it and it\u2019s all so mixed up I\u2019m not convinced it makes sense even to the developers. I did beat Elden Ring but, just as I imagined, the ending explained nothing and whatever pride I felt at defeating the final boss was quickly diminished by not knowing what the heck I had just done and why. From what I can see the DLC is about a character that is barely in the first game and is maybe a prequel? And it seems like it\u2019s going to retcon things by adding in even more characters? I\u2019m not really sure and to be honest I\u2019m not sure I really care. I don\u2019t want to spend another 60 hours beating a game only to understand less about what\u2019s going on than I started. No one wants to be spoon-fed information like a dummy but take it too far in the other direction and, in my opinion, it just all becomes meaningless nonsense.

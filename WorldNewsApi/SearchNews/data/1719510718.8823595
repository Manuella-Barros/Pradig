{"id": 223668448, "title": "Magnetic switches vs mechanical switches: which keyboard is best for gaming?", "text": "There are a range of different keyboard switches on the market, here's a look at the differences between magnetic and mechanical switches. If you're in the market for one of the best gaming keyboards, then it's likely that you have come across a range of different switch types, with the newest being magnetic and the most prevalent being mechanical. If you're not entirely sure what the differences are between the two are, then you're in the right place. We're going over the key differences, including structural differences, customisation of actuation points and the additional features on offer from magnetic switches. When testing out the difference between magnetic and mechanical switches, I used the MelGeek Cyber01 keyboard, which contains MelGeek's very own magnetic switches. This keyboard comes in at \u00a3149 / $149 which roughly converts to AU$225, pricing it at a similar cost to mechanical alternatives while still providing you with the magnetic experience and features. Magnetic switches vs mechanical switches: key differences The difference between magnetic and mechanical switches lies in the structure of the switch itself, which then leads to different actuation points. Magnetic keyboards are also more customisable allowing gamers to either take full advantage of the switch's depth or activate keys with a light tap. Structural differences Magnetic and mechanical switches are built differently, and the contents inside each switch also affect how it registers an input. Magnetic switches, as the name suggests, contain magnets and springs which are activated by sensing magnetic flux changes. This means as you push in on a magnetic switch and a change in force is detected, this counts as an input making for a very quick input compared to alternatives. Mechanical switches on the other hand are made from metal shrapnel and springs. As you press down on the keycap, the metal is pushed down and makes contact with its contact point, which then registers as an input. Since you need to reach the contact point for your button press to register as an input, you're looking at a slightly longer registration time, otherwise known as the actuation point. Customisation of actuation points Although magnetic switches have a significantly smaller actuation point, this can easily be customised on most keyboards which utilise said switches. This means you don't have to worry about mis-inputs if you've got shaky hands or often fat-finger your keyboard and mash extra unnecessary keys in a panic. Magnetic switches can be fully adjusted through the full depth of the switch. On the other hand, the actuation point on mechanical switches cannot be adjusted due to the structure of the switch itself. The contact point within the switch is either activated or not meaning you have a specific actuation point which cannot be controlled. Additional features Unlike mechanical switches, using magnetic switches opens doors to a ton of otherwise unusable features so long as the keyboard you pick up supports it. The first is rapid trigger, for those who often find themselves having to tap keys multiple times in quick succession whether it be to fire a gun or activate a combo move. With magnetic switches, you don't have to wait for the key to move back to its resting position for it to count as deactivated instead, as soon as you release any type of pressure, it will deactivate. This means when rapidly pressing a key you don't have to lift your finger off the button before pressing down again, as you would with mechanical switches. Another feature you're able to take advantage of is dynamic keystroke. This allows you to execute multiple actions with one key press depending on how hard you push down on the key, making for an excellent way to adjust between running or walking within a game without having to consider any other keys. Magnetic switches vs mechanical switches: which is better for gaming When deciding what type of keyboard you'd like to pick up for gaming, magnetic is the clear winner in our opinion, due to the customisation options and additional features you can access. However, another factor to consider is, of course, that price will vary based on which option you decide to pick up. With magnetic switches being more of a recent development, they can still be somewhat costly, so its worth weighing up whether the extra features on offer are something you will find yourself using given the extra cost.", "summary": "Here are the key differences between these two major switch types so you know which keyboard you should pick up.", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/magnetic-switches-vs-mechanical-switches-32876986", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/gaming/article32885832.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Untitled-1sscdazsca.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:00", "author": "Jasmine Mannan,Jasmine-mannan", "authors": ["Jasmine Mannan", "Jasmine-mannan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.037}

They followed that by sweeping No. 26 duo of Australia's Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy.\n\nKloth and Nuss -- teammates at LSU, where Kloth transferred after four seasons of indoor at Creighton -- won Pool B and advanced to the single-elimination tournament with a come-from-behind win over the Chinese team of Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy.\n\nPhotos: Creighton volleyball practice on Dec. 4, 2023 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-01.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-02.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-03.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-04.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-05.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-06.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-07.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-08.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-09.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-10.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-11.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-12.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-13.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-14.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-15.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-16.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-17.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-18.JPG 120523-owh-spo-cuvol-19.JPG", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_walker@omaha.com", "name": "Jon Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Humana-Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Humana-Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9d\u00e9ration_Internationale_de_Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariafe_Artacho_del_Solar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariafe Artacho del Solar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliqua_Clancy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taliqua Clancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Bansley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heather Bansley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/8a/88a36fe8-527e-11ef-82fc-7be816c2bf37/66b1090da1476.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792429", "eventUri": "eng-9792429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nLyles breezes through 200 heat\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAllman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74. She put the competition totally out of reach with a 69.50 on her fourth attempt.\n\nAlso, Keely Hodgkinson gave Britain its first athletics gold medal of the Paris Olympics by winning the women's 800-meter final.\n\nThe victory made the 22-year-old Hodgkinson the third British woman to win Olympic 800-meter gold, joining Anne Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Games and Kelly Holmes in Athens in 2004.\n\nU.S. has mixed results in beach volleyball\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nSwimming in the Seine\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nSpain reaches second straight Olympic soccer final\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco.\n\nSpain will face host France in the final on Friday. France advanced with a 3-1 victory over Egypt in the second semifinal.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nBritish cyclists set world record in women's team sprint\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters.

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nLyles breezes through 200 heat\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAllman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74. She put the competition totally out of reach with a 69.50 on her fourth attempt.\n\nAlso, Keely Hodgkinson gave Britain its first athletics gold medal of the Paris Olympics by winning the women's 800-meter final.\n\nThe victory made the 22-year-old Hodgkinson the third British woman to win Olympic 800-meter gold, joining Anne Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Games and Kelly Holmes in Athens in 2004.\n\nU.S. has mixed results in beach volleyball\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nSwimming in the Seine\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nSpain reaches second straight Olympic soccer final\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco.\n\nSpain will face host France in the final on Friday. France advanced with a 3-1 victory over Egypt in the second semifinal.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nBritish cyclists set world record in women's team sprint\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics,

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Aug. 4 and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Aug. 5.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Aug. 4 that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco.\n\nSpain will face host France in the final on Aug. 9. France advanced with a 3-1 victory over Egypt in the second semifinal.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.", "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "dataType":

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nSam Kendricks captured silver in a pole vault competition that featured Sweden's Mondo Duplantis breaking his own world record. The medals from Allman and Kendricks gave the U.S. 11 so far in the meet, including three golds.\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com",

In contrast, Kloth and Nuss entered the Olympics as the second-ranked team.\n\nThose rankings didn't matter in Paris on Monday as the Canadian duo took home a victory, winning () in sets at the picturesque Eiffel Tower Stadium. Canada took an early lead in the second set\n\nIt was anything but easy for the Canadian duo as they had to erase a five-point deficit early and fought to take a razor-thin opening set 21-19. The second set was also a battle, as the Canadians took an early lead only for the Americans to erase it.\n\nIn the end, Humana-Parades and Wilkerson were able to weather the storm and take the second set 21-18 to propel Canada to a straight-set victory.\n\nThis is the second straight Olympics that Canada has advanced to the knockout stage in women's beach volleyball.

That's been our goal for the past four years. So to go out in the round of 16 is obviously an earlier exit than we would have liked.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nWilkerson isn't just a giant killer in Olympic beach volleyball: She's an American giant killer. She also eliminated the U.S. pair of Cheng and Sarah Sponcil in the first round of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games.\n\n\"That's what she's good at doing,\" Humana-Paredes said with a laugh.\n\n\"But honestly,\" Wilkerson said, \"they're an amazing team. And it's a whole new tournament. It's a whole new Games, whole new atmosphere. We're all different skill levels from what I was even, four years ago.\n\n\"We knew we were going to play this team at some point. They're one of the best teams in the world. We thought it would be later in the tournament, because we both deserve to have a shot at those medals. But when we're put in this situation, we were ready to respond.\"\n\nIn other matches on Monday, Spain beat Poland in the men's bracket, keeping six-time Olympian Pablo Herrera alive in his quest for his first medal since he won silver in Athens, 20 years ago. On the women's side, Latvia beat Germany and Spain beat the Netherlands.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions, on Monday afternoon. To start off the night session, first-time Olympians Benesh and Partain knocked out four-time Olympian Paolo Nicolai and his partner, Samuele Cottafava, 21-19, 21-18.\n\n\"I am very in awe of how long they've been playing at such a high level. It's definitely difficult to keep pushing your body after you're at such a level of excellence. So I'm really inspired by those guys,\" said Partain, who at 22 is the youngest person ever to represent the United States in Olympic beach volleyball.\n\n\"It's cool that beach volleyball is a lifelong sport that you can play at a really high level till how old they are -- and even past,\" he said. \"So I'm really glad to be a part of the sport that can do that encourages that and it's part of its, kind of aura.\"\n\nAlready at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe defending men's gold medalists from Norway are 27 and 28 and the top-ranked team from Sweden features a pair of 22-year-olds.\n\nNicolai said he hasn't made a decision on whether to go for a fifth Olympics. He would be 40 for Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"I'm 36, and I have to be sure that if I started a new Olympic journey, that I'm ready to do it,\" he said. \"Because I know how difficult it is to be focused for four more years.\"\n\nSo, is it a young person's sport?\n\n\"I hope so, because that means that we have a great future,\" Nicolai said. \"The Norwegians, Swedish, they are the top two in the rankings. And they are really young. So that's great because they are full of energy. And so maybe after this tournament we can do something more for our sport because we deserve it.\"\n\n\"In all the two weeks, the crowd was always full and always crazy for the beach volleyball,\" he said. \"That's the moment for us, for our sport to grow.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nU.S. has mixed results in beach volleyball\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nSwimming in the Seine\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nSpain reaches second straight Olympic soccer final\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nBritish cyclists set world record in women's team sprint\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics, visit https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The matchup will be broadcasted on Peacock at 11 a.m. CT, so fans can watch this quarterfinal matchup live online.\n\nTaryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss have been performing at a high level for America this summer, as they finished pool play with a 3-0 record. The American duo only lost one set through three matches, so they will be one of the strongest teams participating in the knockout stage.\n\nTeam USA notched a huge win during their second game of pool play, as they swept Australia's Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy. The Australian duo secured a silver medal at the 2020 Olympic Games, so they were one of the best teams at the competition this year. Since Kloth and Nuss were able to dominate in that matchup, they have a great chance to reach the podium this summer.\n\nNotably, Team USA lost the first set in their most recent match against China's Xue Chen and Xia Xinyi. However, the American squad was able to win back-to-back sets and earn the victory. Kloth and Nuss showcased their resilience in the match, as they had to overcome a large deficit and a weather delay.\n\nThe Canadian squad finished pool play in third place, as they barely reached the knockout stage with a 1-2 record. The team won their opening match in two sets, but they struggled mightily during their last two games.\n\nCanada was able to bounce back with a victory in the lucky loser match, sweeping Czechia's duo to earn a spot in the quarterfinal round.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariafe_Artacho_del_Solar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariafe Artacho del Solar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliqua_Clancy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taliqua Clancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_Xinyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xia Xinyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xue_Chen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xue Chen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/WTYO75L2DBG3BF7A7C3NVQZZA4.jpg?auth=26524a949c30ea143f7fe7ad9972773d3c9bf6272678b14f02c68cbaa24b0457&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792429", "eventUri": "eng-9792429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics,

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nLyles breezes through 200 heat\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAllman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74. She put the competition totally out of reach with a 69.50 on her fourth attempt.\n\nAlso, Keely Hodgkinson gave Britain its first athletics gold medal of the Paris Olympics by winning the women's 800-meter final.\n\nThe victory made the 22-year-old Hodgkinson the third British woman to win Olympic 800-meter gold, joining Anne Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Games and Kelly Holmes in Athens in 2004.\n\nU.S. has mixed results in beach volleyball\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nSwimming in the Seine\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nSpain reaches second straight Olympic soccer final\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nBritish cyclists set world record in women's team sprint\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics, visit

That's been our goal for the past four years. So to go out in the round of 16 is obviously an earlier exit than we would have liked.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nWilkerson isn't just a giant killer in Olympic beach volleyball: She's an American giant killer. She also eliminated the U.S. pair of Cheng and Sarah Sponcil in the first round of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games.\n\n\"That's what she's good at doing,\" Humana-Paredes said with a laugh.\n\n\"But honestly,\" Wilkerson said, \"they're an amazing team. And it's a whole new tournament. It's a whole new Games, whole new atmosphere. We're all different skill levels from what I was even, four years ago.\n\n\"We knew we were going to play this team at some point. They're one of the best teams in the world. We thought it would be later in the tournament, because we both deserve to have a shot at those medals. But when we're put in this situation, we were ready to respond.\"\n\nIn other matches on Monday, Spain beat Poland in the men's bracket, keeping six-time Olympian Pablo Herrera alive in his quest for his first medal since he won silver in Athens, 20 years ago. On the women's side, Latvia beat Germany and Spain beat the Netherlands.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions, on Monday afternoon. To start off the night session, first-time Olympians Benesh and Partain knocked out four-time Olympian Paolo Nicolai and his partner, Samuele Cottafava, 21-19, 21-18.\n\n\"I am very in awe of how long they've been playing at such a high level. It's definitely difficult to keep pushing your body after you're at such a level of excellence. So I'm really inspired by those guys,\" said Partain, who at 22 is the youngest person ever to represent the United States in Olympic beach volleyball.\n\n\"It's cool that beach volleyball is a lifelong sport that you can play at a really high level till how old they are -- and even past,\" he said. \"So I'm really glad to be a part of the sport that can do that encourages that and it's part of its, kind of aura.\"\n\nAlready at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe defending men's gold medalists from Norway are 27 and 28 and the top-ranked team from Sweden features a pair of 22-year-olds.\n\nNicolai said he hasn't made a decision on whether to go for a fifth Olympics. He would be 40 for Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"I'm 36, and I have to be sure that if I started a new Olympic journey, that I'm ready to do it,\" he said. \"Because I know how difficult it is to be focused for four more years.\"\n\nSo, is it a young person's sport?\n\n\"I hope so, because that means that we have a great future,\" Nicolai said. \"The Norwegians, Swedish, they are the top two in the rankings. And they are really young. So that's great because they are full of energy. And so maybe after this tournament we can do something more for our sport because we deserve it.\"\n\n\"In all the two weeks, the crowd was always full and always crazy for the beach volleyball,\" he said. \"That's the moment for us, for our sport to grow.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nLyles breezes through 200 heat\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAllman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74. She put the competition totally out of reach with a 69.50 on her fourth attempt.\n\nAlso, Keely Hodgkinson gave Britain its first athletics gold medal of the Paris Olympics by winning the women's 800-meter final.\n\nThe victory made the 22-year-old Hodgkinson the third British woman to win Olympic 800-meter gold, joining Anne Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Games and Kelly Holmes in Athens in 2004.\n\nU.S. has mixed results in beach volleyball\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nSwimming in the Seine\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nSpain reaches second straight Olympic soccer final\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nBritish cyclists set world record in women's team sprint\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics, visit

On the Champ de Mars, where the first mayor of Paris was sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror, the American beach volleyball squad got cut in half.\n\nParis, Aug 6 (AP) On the Champ de Mars, where the first mayor of Paris was sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror, the American beach volleyball squad got cut in half.\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium on Monday, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's round of 16 a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nAlso Read | Indian Hockey Team Good Luck Wishes: WhatsApp DP, Status, Instagram Images, Facebook Story to Send Best Wishes to Indian Men's Hockey Team Ahead of Paris Olympics 2024 Semifinal Against Germany.\n\nOnly Miles Partain and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\n\"Definitely a little heartbroken,\" said Nuss, who along with her former LSU teammate formed the No. 2 team in the world rankings. \"We came in wanting to bring home gold back to the United States. That's been our goal for the past four years. So to go out in the round of 16 is obviously an earlier exit than we would have liked.\"\n\nAlso Read | India at Olympics 2024 Schedule Today: Check Full List of Indian Athletes in Action on August 6 in Paris With Time in IST.\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nWilkerson isn't just a giant killer in Olympic beach volleyball: She's an American giant killer. She also eliminated the U.S. pair of Cheng and Sarah Sponcil in the first round of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games.\n\n\"That's what she's good at doing,\" Humana-Paredes said with a laugh.\n\n\"But honestly,\" Wilkerson said, \"they're an amazing team. And it's a whole new tournament. It's a whole new Games, whole new atmosphere. We're all different skill levels from what I was even, four years ago.\n\n\"We knew we were going to play this team at some point. They're one of the best teams in the world. We thought it would be later in the tournament, because we both deserve to have a shot at those medals. But when we're put in this situation, we were ready to respond.\"\n\nIn other men's matches on Monday, Qatar beat Chile in straight sets, setting up a quarterfinal matchup with Partain and Benesh. Spain beat Poland, keeping six-time Olympian Pablo Herrera alive in his quest for his first medal since he won silver in Athens, 20 years ago.\n\nOn the women's side, Latvia beat Germany, Spain beat the Netherlands and Brazil beat Japan.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions, on Monday afternoon. To start off the night session, first-time Olympians Benesh and Partain knocked out four-time Olympian Paolo Nicolai and his partner, Samuele Cottafava, 21-19, 21-18.\n\n\"I am very in awe of how long they've been playing at such a high level. It's definitely difficult to keep pushing your body after you're at such a level of excellence. So I'm really inspired by those guys,\" said Partain, who at 22 is the youngest person ever to represent the United States in Olympic beach volleyball.\n\n\"It's cool that beach volleyball is a lifelong sport that you can play at a really high level till how old they are -- and even past,\" he said. \"So I'm really glad to be a part of the sport that can do that encourages that and it's part of its, kind of aura.\"\n\nAlready at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe defending men's gold medalists from Norway are 27 and 28 and the top-ranked team from Sweden features a pair of 22-year-olds.\n\nNicolai said he hasn't made a decision on whether to go for a fifth Olympics. He would be 40 for Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"I'm 36, and I have to be sure that if I started a new Olympic journey, that I'm ready to do it,\" he said. \"Because I know how difficult it is to be focused for four more years.\"\n\nSo, is it a young person's sport?\n\n\"I hope so, because that means that we have a great future,\" Nicolai said. \"The Norwegians, Swedish, they are the top two in the rankings. And they are really young. So that's great because they are full of energy. And so maybe after this tournament we can do something more for our sport because we deserve it.\"\n\n\"In all the two weeks, the crowd was always full and always crazy for the beach volleyball,\" he said. \"That's the moment for us, for our sport to grow.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that the U.S. teams lost in the round of 16, not the quarterfinals. And Miles Partain, not Miles Evans, advanced.

That\u00b4s been our goal for the past four years. So to go out in the round of 16 is obviously an earlier exit than we would have liked.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women\u00b4s gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nWilkerson isn\u00b4t just a giant killer in Olympic beach volleyball: She\u00b4s an American giant killer. She also eliminated the U.S. pair of Cheng and Sarah Sponcil in the first round of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games.\n\nUnited States' Taryn Kloth, left, and Kristen Nuss walk off the court after a loss to Canada in a beach volleyball match at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\n\"That\u00b4s what she\u00b4s good at doing,\" Humana-Paredes said with a laugh.\n\n\"But honestly,\" Wilkerson said, \"they\u00b4re an amazing team. And it\u00b4s a whole new tournament. It\u00b4s a whole new Games, whole new atmosphere. We\u00b4re all different skill levels from what I was even, four years ago.\n\n\"We knew we were going to play this team at some point. They\u00b4re one of the best teams in the world. We thought it would be later in the tournament, because we both deserve to have a shot at those medals. But when we\u00b4re put in this situation, we were ready to respond.\"\n\nIn other matches on Monday, Spain beat Poland in the men's bracket, keeping six-time Olympian Pablo Herrera alive in his quest for his first medal since he won silver in Athens, 20 years ago. On the women's side, Latvia beat Germany and Spain beat the Netherlands.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions, on Monday afternoon. To start off the night session, first-time Olympians Benesh and Partain knocked out four-time Olympian Paolo Nicolai and his partner, Samuele Cottafava, 21-19, 21-18.\n\n\"I am very in awe of how long they\u00b4ve been playing at such a high level. It\u00b4s definitely difficult to keep pushing your body after you\u00b4re at such a level of excellence. So I\u00b4m really inspired by those guys,\" said Partain, who at 22 is the youngest person ever to represent the United States in Olympic beach volleyball.\n\n\"It\u00b4s cool that beach volleyball is a lifelong sport that you can play at a really high level till how old they are - and even past,\" he said. \"So I\u00b4m really glad to be a part of the sport that can do that encourages that and it\u00b4s part of its, kind of aura.\"\n\nAlready at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe defending men\u00b4s gold medalists from Norway are 27 and 28 and the top-ranked team from Sweden features a pair of 22-year-olds.\n\nNicolai said he hasn\u00b4t made a decision on whether to go for a fifth Olympics. He would be 40 for Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"I\u00b4m 36, and I have to be sure that if I started a new Olympic journey, that I\u00b4m ready to do it,\" he said. \"Because I know how difficult it is to be focused for four more years.\"\n\nSo, is it a young person\u00b4s sport?\n\n\"I hope so, because that means that we have a great future,\" Nicolai said. \"The Norwegians, Swedish, they are the top two in the rankings. And they are really young. So that\u00b4s great because they are full of energy. And so maybe after this tournament we can do something more for our sport because we deserve it.\"\n\n\"In all the two weeks, the crowd was always full and always crazy for the beach volleyball,\" he said. \"That\u00b4s the moment for us, for our sport to grow.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nUnited States' Taryn Kloth, top, and Kristen Nuss hug after a loss to Canada in a beach volleyball match at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Paris, France.

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAllman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74. She put the competition totally out of reach with a 69.50 on her fourth attempt.\n\nAlso, Keely Hodgkinson gave Britain its first athletics gold medal of the Paris Olympics by winning the women's 800-meter final.\n\nThe victory made the 22-year-old Hodgkinson the third British woman to win Olympic 800-meter gold, joining Anne Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Games and Kelly Holmes in Athens in 2004.\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics,

Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth lost to Canada's Melissa Humana-Paredes and Brandie Wilkerson in straight sets, 21-19, 21-18, on Monday.\n\nThe first set was a back-and-forth exchange, with the U.S. taking a 14-10 lead midway through the match. But Canada rallied to score the next five points to go on top, 15-14. From there, each team exchanged ties and the lead. But a block by Wilkerson earned a 19-17 lead, which Canada held onto to win the set.\n\nNuss and Kloth initially looked as if they would lose the second set badly, falling behind 10-5. But they fought back, finding the open spaces and forcing errors on the Canadian side. However, Humana-Paredes finally stopped the U.S. rally with an attack point to take an 11-9 lead.\n\nThe U.S. couldn't get any closer from there, falling behind 12-9 and 13-10. Wilkerson's serve soon led Canada to restore a four-point lead at 15-11. Yet Nuss and Kloth fought back again to tie the set at 18-18 on a block at the net.\n\nHowever, Wilkerson's defense at the net was ultimately too tough, getting a block to take a 19-18 lead, and Canada went on to score the next two points for the win. Wilkerson and Humana-Paredes will face Spain's Daniela Alvarez and Tania Moreno in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe U.S. women will have one pair in the quarterfinals with Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng defeating Italy's Valentina Gottardi and Marta Menegatti in three sets on Sunday. They will face Switzerland's Nina Brunner and Tanja H\u00fcberli in Tuesday's match.\n\nOn the men's side, USA's Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh advanced to the quarterfinals of the Olympic tournament. The pair defeated Italy's Samuele Cottafava and Paolo Nicolai in straight sets, 21-17, 21-18.\n\nIn the second set, Partain and Benesh took control after the score was tied 11-11. The pair scored the next five points to take a 16-11 lead, and Cottafava and Nicolai could not recover. Italy did close it to 20-18, but Partain and Benesh got the final point for the victory. The men's beach volleyball quarterfinals begin on Wednesday, with matchups yet to be announced.\n\nThe U.S. controlled the first set in similar fashion, twice building five-point leads at 12-7 and 14-9. Cottafava and Nicolai could never climb back to tie from there.\n\nPartain and Benesh made headlines off the court last week when they split from coach Mike Placek. Since the parting, the two have defeated teams from Brazil and Italy. In a statement about the parting, the team said they wanted to \"explore different strategic paths.\" Without Placek for the past two matches, that decision appears to have worked out.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Humana-Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Humana-Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandie_Wilkerson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandie Wilkerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Claes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Claes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sara Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Nicolai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Nicolai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Menegatti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marta Menegatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanja_H\u00fcberli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanja H\u00fcberli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Betschart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nina Betschart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/..stsC2j57EmPD.EmiHbnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/028cef80-534e-11ef-b9fe-983a394b4861", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792429", "eventUri": "eng-9792429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nNoah Lyles had no problem in his opening 200-meter heat. It was a 20.19-second, no-drama romp around the curve that was routine. So, nothing like his photo finish .005-second victory in the 100 on Sunday night.\n\nLyles beat defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse of Canada in the 200 by .11 seconds.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first man to double since Usain Bolt did it for the third time at the Rio Games in 2016. Carl Lewis is the last U.S. man to pull it off in the 100-200, back in 1984 in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso advancing in the 200 were Americans Erriyon Knighton (20.00) and Kenny Bednarek, who ran 19.97 and could very well be Lyles' biggest challenger for the final on Thursday.\n\nValarie Allman made it back-to-back golds as the American won women's discus. She also won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAllman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74. She put the competition totally out of reach with a 69.50 on her fourth attempt.\n\nAlso, Keely Hodgkinson gave Britain its first athletics gold medal of the Paris Olympics by winning the women's 800-meter final.\n\nThe victory made the 22-year-old Hodgkinson the third British woman to win Olympic 800-meter gold, joining Anne Packer at the 1964 Tokyo Games and Kelly Holmes in Athens in 2004.\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women's quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men's.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium's Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes -- of the more than 100 who competed in the men's and women's races last Wednesday -- became sick in the following days, though it's unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men's soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament's leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder's fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez's assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women's team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation's first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event's debut in 2008.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics,

The Canadian pair was ranked fourth heading in the Paris Olympics, while Kloth and Nuss entered the Games as the second-ranked team and arguably the gold-medal favourite.\n\nAs expected, it was quite the battle for the Canadian side, which overcame an early five-point deficit before eventually taking a nail-biter of a first set 21-19. The second frame was also a tight one, with Canada grabbing an early lead before the American duo came storming back. Wilkerson and Humana-Parades were able to hold on and take the second set 21-18 to seal a Canadian victory.\n\nCanada advances to the knockout stage in women's beach volleyball for the second straight Olympic Games. Wilkerson and Humana-Parades will face Tania Moreno Matveeva and Daniela Alvarez Mendoza of Spain in Wednesday's quarterfinal.\n\nCanada falls to top-seeded Germany, will play for bronze medal in women's 3x3 basketball\n\nGermany pulled off a thrilling 16-15 win over Canada in the women's 3x3 basketball semifinal on Monday, with Sonja Greinacher dropping the game-winning bucket on a drive with just one second remaining.\n\nCanadian star Michelle Plouffe tied the contest at 15-15 with less than 15 seconds left, before the top-ranked German side secured the dramatic victory.\n\nCanada took down Australia in a play-in game to reach the semifinals, while Germany got a bye to the semis after finishing first in the preliminary round.

She finished second to Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Third went to American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who was bumped to bronze when the U.S. coaches asked for a review of her degree of difficulty on the routine.\n\nThe review changed her score just enough to push her onto the podium, where the three Black women posed together four days after Biles, Andrade and Sunisa Lee, who is Hmong-American, stood in the same spot following the all-around. Their collective success is symbolic of a sport that is becoming more diverse and more inclusive at the highest level.\n\nPrior to the floor exercise, Biles and Lee failed to medal on the balance beam. Both gymnasts made mistakes and wondered if Paris organizers' decision not to play music during the events created a distracting eerie silence.\n\nBiles is now an 11-time Olympic medalist and hasn't ruled out trying to compete in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nJordan Chiles, of the United States, and Simone Biles, left, show off their medals after the women's artistic gymnastics individual apparatus finals Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nA look at some of the highlights of Day 10 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nTwo U.S. teams fell on the sand at Eiffel Tower Stadium, with Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss losing to Canada in the women\u00b4s quarterfinals a few hours after Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to Norway in the men\u00b4s.\n\nOnly Miles Evans and Andy Benesh advanced on the day, joining Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes in the elite eight.\n\nKloth and Nuss are ranked No. 2 in the world, and Nuss said she was \"definitely a little heartbroken.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women\u00b4s gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions. Already at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nThe Seine River was determined safe enough to swim in and Olympic triathletes plunged into the murky water for the mixed relay event after organizers said bacteria levels in the long-polluted Paris waterway were at acceptable levels.\n\nThe plan to hold the swimming portion of the triathlons and the marathon swimming events in the Seine was an ambitious one as swimming in the river has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923 because it has been too toxic.\n\nWater quality tests were reviewed Sunday night and the results indicated the water quality at the triathlon site had improved over the preceding hours and was within the limits mandated by World Triathlon by Monday morning.\n\nIn a very close sprint finish, the team from Germany won the gold medal in the team relay. The United States took silver and Britain clinched bronze.\n\nThe decision to allow the event to go forward with swims in the Seine came after Belgium\u00b4s Olympic committee announced Sunday that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the river last week fell ill. Another three triathletes - of the more than 100 who competed in the men\u00b4s and women\u00b4s races last Wednesday - became sick in the following days, though it\u00b4s unclear whether the water was to blame.\n\nJuanlu Sanchez came off the bench to lift Spain into a record-equaling fifth Olympic men\u00b4s soccer final. Sanchez scored in the 85th minute at Stade de Marseille to seal a 2-1 win over Morocco and set up a final against either France or Egypt.\n\nMorocco led 1-0 at halftime after the tournament\u00b4s leading scorer Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 37th.\n\nSpain evened the score in the 65th after Fermin Lopez showed quick feet in the box and fired a left-footed shot low in the bottom corner. It was the Barcelona midfielder\u00b4s fourth goal of the tournament and over-exuberant celebrations earned him a yellow card after kicking the corner flag and breaking it in two.\n\nIt was Lopez\u00b4s assist that set up Sanchez to sweep his winning goal low into the far corner.\n\nSpain, which won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, lost in the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago to Brazil.\n\nThe British trio of Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane shattered the world record in the women\u00b4s team sprint while beating New Zealand in a head-to-head showdown for the gold medal to open the track cycling program.\n\nIn the three-lap race, the British trio trailed Rebecca Petch, Shaane Fulton and Ellesse Andrews after the first 250 meters. But they quickly pulled ahead after the second lap, then blitzed the last to finish in 45.196 seconds, earning their nation\u00b4s first medal inside the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nDespite its proud sprinting tradition, the British had repeatedly missed the podium since the event\u00b4s debut in 2008.\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics, visit https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games.\n\nSimone Biles, of the United States, holds up her medals after the women's artistic gymnastics individual apparatus finals Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Paris, France.

That's been our goal for the past four years. So to go out in the round of 16 is obviously an earlier exit than we would have liked.\"\n\nBrandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes beat Nuss and Kloth 21-19, 21-18, leaving the country that has won four of the last five women's gold medals with just one team in the bracket.\n\nWilkerson isn't just a giant killer in Olympic beach volleyball: She's an American giant killer. She also eliminated the U.S. pair of Cheng and Sarah Sponcil in the first round of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games.\n\n\"That's what she's good at doing,\" Humana-Paredes said with a laugh.\n\n\"But honestly,\" Wilkerson said, \"they're an amazing team. And it's a whole new tournament. It's a whole new Games, whole new atmosphere. We're all different skill levels from what I was even, four years ago.\n\n\"We knew we were going to play this team at some point. They're one of the best teams in the world. We thought it would be later in the tournament, because we both deserve to have a shot at those medals. But when we're put in this situation, we were ready to respond.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn other matches on Monday, Spain beat Poland in the men's bracket, keeping six-time Olympian Pablo Herrera alive in his quest for his first medal since he won silver in Athens, 20 years ago. On the women's side, Latvia beat Germany and Spain beat the Netherlands.\n\nBudinger, a former NBA player, and Evans lost in straight sets to Norway, the defending Olympic champions, on Monday afternoon. To start off the night session, first-time Olympians Benesh and Partain knocked out four-time Olympian Paolo Nicolai and his partner, Samuele Cottafava, 21-19, 21-18.\n\n\"I am very in awe of how long they've been playing at such a high level. It's definitely difficult to keep pushing your body after you're at such a level of excellence. So I'm really inspired by those guys,\" said Partain, who at 22 is the youngest person ever to represent the United States in Olympic beach volleyball.\n\n\"It's cool that beach volleyball is a lifelong sport that you can play at a really high level till how old they are -- and even past,\" he said. \"So I'm really glad to be a part of the sport that can do that encourages that and it's part of its, kind of aura.\"\n\nAlready at Paris, five-time Olympian and Rio de Janeiro gold medalist Laura Ludwig of Germany has been eliminated, and the 42-year-old Herrera has said he will retire.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe defending men's gold medalists from Norway are 27 and 28 and the top-ranked team from Sweden features a pair of 22-year-olds.\n\nNicolai said he hasn't made a decision on whether to go for a fifth Olympics. He would be 40 for Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"I'm 36, and I have to be sure that if I started a new Olympic journey, that I'm ready to do it,\" he said. \"Because I know how difficult it is to be focused for four more years.\"\n\nSo, is it a young person's sport?\n\n\"I hope so, because that means that we have a great future,\" Nicolai said. \"The Norwegians, Swedish, they are the top two in the rankings. And they are really young. So that's great because they are full of energy. And so maybe after this tournament we can do something more for our sport because we deserve it.\"\n\n\"In all the two weeks, the crowd was always full and always crazy for the beach volleyball,\" he

The Canadian pair was ranked fourth heading in the Paris Olympics, while Kloth and Nuss entered the Games as the second-ranked team and arguably the gold-medal favourite.\n\nAs expected, it was quite the battle for the Canadian side, which overcame an early five-point deficit before eventually taking a nail-biter of a first set 21-19. The second frame was also a tight one, with Canada grabbing an early lead before the American duo came storming back. Wilkerson and Humana-Parades were able to hold on and take the second set 21-18 to seal a Canadian victory.\n\nCanada advances to the knockout stage in women's beach volleyball for the second straight Olympic Games. Wilkerson and Humana-Parades will face Tania Moreno Matveeva and Daniela Alvarez Mendoza of Spain in Wednesday's quarterfinal.\n\nThe Canadian women's 3x3 basketball team fell short of a medal on Monday, losing to the Americans in the bronze-medal game after falling to Germany in the semifinals earlier in the day.\n\nJust like the Canada-Germany semifinal, this one came right down to the wire. Dearica Hamby gave the Americans their first lead of the contest with just over a minute remaining before Cierra Burdick nailed a free throw -- but missed the second -- to give Team USA a two-point lead with 39 seconds left.\n\nA couple of Canada's two-point attempts over the final seconds missed and timely rebounding by the United States put Burdick at the free-throw line, where she made one-of-two to essentially ice it for the Americans with seven seconds remaining.\n\nCanada's gold-medal dreams were dashed earlier in the day when Germany pulled off a thrilling 16-15 win over Canada in the women's 3x3 semifinal, with Sonja Greinacher dropping the game-winning bucket on a drive with just one second remaining.\n\nCanadian star Michelle Plouffe tied the contest at 15-15 with less than 15 seconds left, before the top-ranked German side secured the dramatic victory.\n\nCanada took down Australia in a play-in game to reach the semifinals before losing to Germany.\n\nTeam USA, meanwhile, miraculously earned a medal after dropping its first three contests of the Paris Games -- following that up with four-straight wins to reach the semifinals before a loss to Spain set up the bronze-medal match with Canada.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3x3_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3x3 basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandie_Wilkerson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandie Wilkerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Humana-Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Humana-Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendoza,_Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mendoza, Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mendoza, Argentina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cierra_Burdick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cierra Burdick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dearica_Hamby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dearica Hamby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Plouffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Plouffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Bandy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Bandy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_hhCpG9DnidceO8z9Mnfdg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/f10f56c0-5353-11ef-9dbf-acc8bdf25610", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792429", "eventUri": "eng-9792429", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

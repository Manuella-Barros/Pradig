Why? It's the traditional opener for walleye and other game fish on Wisconsin's inland waters.\n\nThe year the start of the general inland season falls on May 4.\n\nAnglers should expect good conditions when they take to the waters for the opener, according to Justine Hasz, fisheries director for the Department of Natural Resources.\n\n\"Our fisheries are in good stead across the state,\" Hasz said during a Tuesday media briefing to preview and promote the season.\n\nThe run-up to the inland opener has been anything but normal, however.\n\nAn abnormally mild winter led to ice coming off some Wisconsin waters the earliest in recorded history. Then a cold snap in March saw some northern waters ice over. The last several weeks have settled into a semblance of normal for spring in Wisconsin.\n\n\"So we've definitely seen some erratic weather and the fish really do react to that,\" Hasz said. \"But now we are sitting here in late April and the fish are starting to get back on track and doing what they are supposed to be doing at this time of year.\"\n\nHasz said this year's timing for walleye activity should be especially good for the opener.\n\n\"We expect that by opening day, the majority of the walleyes in the state will have completed their spring spawning runs and they'll be very hungry,\" she said. \"The females put a lot of energy into producing eggs over winter and once they've laid those eggs they're pretty hungry and want to put some weight on.\"\n\nShe even offered advice to walleye anglers on lures and tactics (the time-honored jig and minnow or jig and plastic tail) and made a prediction.\n\n\"Most anglers fishing in walleye waters should get rewarded with a bite or two of walleye on opening day,\" Hasz said.\n\nWith regard to panfish, a term to cover the most caught species in the state including bluegill, yellow perch, black crappie and pumkinseed sunfish, Hasz said anglers should also find good action. She suggested panfish anglers target areas of the lake with the warmest water and near areas of new aquatic plant growth.\n\nThe inland trout fishery, with about 13,000 miles of classified trout streams, and the Great Lakes, for species such as chinook and coho salmon, are also expected to provide very good fishing in 2024, Hasz said.\n\n\"Overall, no matter whether you are north, south, east or west, whether you are on the Great Lakes or on the Mississippi River, there's a place for everyone to go fishing right now, a location is just around the corner from where people live,\" Hasz said. \"We expect fishing to be really solid for the whole year, but definitely as we go into the opening of the season.\"\n\nLicense requirements for Wisconsin fishing season\n\nWisconsin residents and nonresidents age 16 and older must have a fishing license to fish in any waters of the state. An annual license costs $20 for residents. A $5 option is available for first-time buyers.\n\nTo buy a license, visit a sales outlet such as a sporting goods store or bait and tackle shop or visit gowild.wi.gov.\n\nThe new rule pertains to walleyes and saugers or a combination of the species.\n\nOutlying waters, including Lake Michigan, Lake Superior and the Mississippi River, are not affected by the change.\n\nAnother new regulation pertains to fishing tournaments. Effective this year, all fishing tournaments, regardless of size, must at least file an application for the event. Registration for many is free of charge.\n\nThere are also dozens of new rules specific to local waters, including reduced bag limits or slot size limits. Anglers are advised to carefully review the 2024-25 state fishing regulations pamphlet to be certain of rules on waters they plan to fish. Copies of the booklet may be downloaded at dnr.wi.gov or picked up at license sales outlets.\n\nCatch-and-release recommendations\n\nMany fisheries, including bass, muskellunge and trout, have benefitted from catch-and-release practices.\n\nAnglers are advised to take care in their handling of fish to increase the odds it will survive after release.\n\nThe DNR offers these tips for anglers to successfully release fish: Land the fish as quickly as possible; keep the fish in the water as much as possible; handle the fish as little as possible and touch fish with wet hands or gloves; if the fish is deeply hooked, cut the line and let the fish go; treat the fish gently throughout the release.\n\nAvoid transporting invasive species and diseases\n\nAnglers are also reminded of rules and recommendations to help prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species and diseases.\n\nState rules require anglers to remove plants and animals from their boat before and after launching, draining all water from compartments and never moving live fish away from any waterbody.\n\nTo prevent the spread of fish diseases, remove all water, aquatic vegetation and mud from fishing equipment before leaving their fishing location. All fishing equipment, including boats, trailers, boots, waders, nets and float tubes, should be thoroughly cleaned and dried completely before being used again, according to the DNR.\n\nWear a flotation device\n\nRecreational safety specialists with the DNR and other agencies also remind anglers to follow safe boating procedures and always wear a life jacket. For boating safety tips, visit dnr.wi.gov.\n\nPick up trash\n\nAnglers should leave the land and water cleaner than they found it. Be sure to pick-up and properly discard any fishing line, damaged lures or other trash.", "source": {"uri": "wausaudailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wausau Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walleye", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walleye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panfish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panfish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jigging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Lakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_crappie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black crappie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrarchidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrarchidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salmon run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_perch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yellow perch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluegill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_salmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinook salmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coho salmon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d37554bb4c6c3d92d393a1798085f7ef66ad0b23/c=14-231-3451-2173/local/-/media/2018/05/05/WIGroup/Milwaukee/636611290579578003-Fishing-opener-20.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512001", "eventUri": "eng-9512001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 498, "textEnd": 503}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The Department of Natural Resources has some reminders about new rules and regulations.\n\nOne of the biggest changes, according to the DNR, is a change in the daily walleye bag limit on most inland lakes, to three.\n\n\"For those folks who are used to fishing in the northern third of Wisconsin, you have already been under the three bag limit for several years, at this point. So, you're used to this,\" said Justine Hasz, DNR Fisheries Management Program Bureau Director.\n\nJustine Hasz says the new regulation doesn't include the Great Lakes, nor the waters of Green Bay. At Smokey's on the Bay Bait Shop, owner Jeff Tilkens says the change is needed.\n\n\"They should put that three walleye limit too, on the Bay of Green Bay. Instead of having five over 15, they should be three over 15. We got to conserve our population of fish. Let them grow. Let them go, instead of harvesting so many,\" said Jeff Tilkens, Smokey's on the Bay Owner.\n\nAnother change involves requiring those who run small fishing tournaments to register with the DNR. Hasz says it comes down to accountability.\n\n\"This is really to capture some of these tournaments, that happen every Wednesday, and there's only 15 boats participating. There was a lot of questions, a lot of concerns about the use of waters by tournaments that were not permitted,\" she said.\n\n\"If you have these tournaments, and sometimes the boat launches get a little packed up, and stuff like that. But it's only fair to let people, the general public know, that there's a tournament going on, and what they're doing out there,\" said Tilkens.\n\n\"It's been a big change,\" said Hasz.\n\n\"We have had several hundred tournaments actually already register in the new system. And we're looking forward to gaining some insight and information from how well our fisheries are used by these smaller fishing tournaments,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "fox11online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_peterson@fox11online.com", "name": "Eric Peterson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_limits", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bag limits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walleye", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walleye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_(Lake_Michigan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay (Lake Michigan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Lakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://fox11online.com/resources/media/6802cf99-1d65-4c49-a559-406cfd3a3515-large16x9_WalleyeswimminginthePeshtigoRiverinPeshtigo.JPG?1617396186136", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512001", "eventUri": "eng-9512001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

There really is something magical about it and while I don't get to do it as often as I did when I was a kid, I do still enjoy it very much. Of course to fish in the Hoosier State you do have to have an Indiana state issued fishing license, except on free fishing days!\n\nMark your calendars and get ready to toss your rod and reel over your shoulder and grab your tackle box! The Indiana Department of Natural Resources has revealed their annual free fishing days! That means you don't need a fishing license to cast your line and hook the big one!\n\nAccording to the Indiana DNR, there are four free fishing days in 2024: Sunday, May 12th, Saturday and Sunday, June 1st - 2nd, and Saturday, September 28th.\n\nAccording to TakeMeFishing.org, you can also enjoy free fishing days in Illinois in 2024 too. Enjoy free fishing on Father's Day weekend, Friday through Monday, June 14th to 17th.\n\nIn Indiana, if you're wondering where you can purchase a fishing license so you can fish year-round, you can visit the Indiana Department of Natural Resources website. While you are there, be sure you check out their list of places to go fishing, including what's biting where, as well as guides and regulations for the state.\n\nPersonally, I've always been a fan of fishing for catfish. I feel like they're more fun to catch.

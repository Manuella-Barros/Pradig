While all brains function differently, those with significant cognitive differences such as autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may refer to themselves as neurodivergent or as part of the neurodiverse community. As with any aspect of diversity, there are many nuances in the language that we use to describe individuals and groups. As a best practice, an individual cannot be diverse\u2014only groups are diverse; therefore, calling one person \u201cneurodiverse\u201d is likely incorrect. It is also important to note that many people do not like to be called \u201cneurodivergent\u201d because they may perceive it to have a negative connotation. There is no universal approach to allyship, it is often in the perception of the receiver. If you're hoping to be a better ally to the neurodivergent community, it's important to understand inclusive language. As a general practice, it\u2019s best to listen for cues and mirror the language of the groups you're aspiring to be an ally for. As the mother of an autistic child, I am learning to be a better ally and realize this is a journey, not a destination. Language will shift over time, and I take my cues from those in the community to learn and be better. When I make a mistake, I own it and promise to be better. As allies, we\u2019re modeling the behavior for those around us every day. In my interview with Aimee Harman, a leader in neurodiverse thought leadership, she recommended starting with these ten terms. While there are many more terms to add to the neurodiversity dictionary, understanding these can be a starting point for learning and exploration. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autism spectrum condition (ASC) \u2013 ASD and ASC refer to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. It is often referred to as a \"spectrum\" because symptoms can vary greatly in severity and presentation among individuals. Asperger syndrome \u2013 Asperger syndrome used to be a separate diagnosis, often associated with difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Individuals with Asperger syndrome typically have average to above-average intelligence and language development but may struggle with social skills and understanding social cues. This has evolved to be a part of the ASD spectrum. Comorbidity/coexistence \u2013 Comorbidity refers to the presence of two or more different medical conditions or disorders in a person at the same time. In the context of autism, comorbidity might refer to the presence of other conditions alongside ASD, such as anxiety disorders, ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) or depression. Flexible working \u2013 Flexible working refers to arrangements in employment that allow employees to vary their working hours, patterns or locations to better suit their individual needs. This can include options such as part-time work, telecommuting, flextime or job sharing. High-functioning \u2013 High-functioning refers to individuals with ASD or other neurodevelopmental conditions who have average or above-average intellectual abilities and may exhibit a different range of traits compared to those with more typical ASD characteristics. However, they likely still experience challenges related to social interaction, communication and behavior. Hypersensitivity/hyposensitivity \u2013 Hypersensitivity refers to heightened sensitivity or over-responsiveness to sensory stimuli, such as loud noises, bright lights or certain textures. Hyposensitivity, on the other hand, refers to reduced sensitivity or under-responsiveness to sensory stimuli. Intersectionality \u2013 Intersectionality is a concept used to describe how various social identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, etc.) intersect and interact with each other, resulting in unique experiences of discrimination, privilege and oppression. Neurodivergence/neurodiverse/neurodiversity \u2013 Neurodivergence refers to variations in brain functioning and processing, including conditions such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia and others. Neurodiverse or neurodiversity advocates champion the need to recognize and respect these differences in cognitive and neurological functioning, promoting inclusivity, acceptance and accommodation for individuals with diverse neurological profiles. Reasonable adjustments \u2013 Reasonable adjustments, also known as accommodations, are modifications or adaptations made in various aspects of life (such as education, employment or social settings) to accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities or specific requirements. These adjustments aim to ensure equal opportunities and access for all individuals, and generally benefit everyone, not just those in the neurodiverse community. Self-stimulation/stimming \u2013 Self-stimulation, often referred to as \"stimming,\" refers to repetitive behaviors or movements that individuals with autism or other developmental conditions engage in to self-regulate or to stimulate their senses. Stimming behaviors can include actions like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth or repetitive vocalizations. These behaviors serve various functions, such as reducing anxiety, providing sensory input and expressing emotions.

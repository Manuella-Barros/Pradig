PTI photo A row erupted in Tripura Tuesday when Chief Minister Manik Sarkar, who heads a Left Front government in the state, alleged that Doordarshan and All India Radio (AIR) refused to broadcast his Independence Day address unless he \"reshaped\" it.\n\nA PTI report from Agartala quoted a statement from the Chief Minister's Office: \"The Chief Minister clearly stated that he would not change a single word and described it as unprecedented, undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant step.\"\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Prasar Bharati which runs Doordarshan and All India Radio.\n\nThe government statement alleged that Doordarshan and AIR had recorded Sarkar's speech on August 12. At 7 pm Monday, the Chief Minister's Office was informed via a letter that his speech would not be broadcast unless he \"reshaped it\".\n\nThe letter purportedly said, \"The message of the Chief Minister was closely examined by competent authority.

At 7 pm Monday, the Chief Minister's Office was informed via a letter that his speech would not be broadcast unless he \"reshaped it\".\n\nThe letter purportedly said, \"The message of the Chief Minister was closely examined by competent authority.

However, they subsequently informed him that the speech cannot be carried as it is and asked him to 'reshape' it,\" it said.\n\nDemanding action against those responsible for \"prohibiting\" the broadcast, the politburo said: \"The Modi government should stop treating Prasar Bharati as a department of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.\"\n\n\"This is a gross infringement on the right of a Chief Minister to address the people of his state on Independence Day.

Sarkar and his party, Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)), have alleged that the Prasar Bharati, India's largest public broadcasting agency, refused to broadcast the CM's speech on the Doordarshan (DD) and the All India Radio (AIR).\n\nBoth the DD and the AIR are run by the Prasar Bharati. Every year, as a custom, the DD and the AIR broadcast the speeches of all the CMs of the country in their respective states during the Independence Day.\n\nHowever, this time, the Prasar Bharati allegedly did not broadcast Sarkar's speech after he refused to \"reshape\" his speech recorded on August 12. Sarkar has termed the move as an \"undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant step\". However, the Prasar Bharati is yet to issue any statement in this regard.\n\nA Tripura government press statement alleged that the DD and the AIR had recorded Sarkar's speech on August 12.\n\nOn August 14, the CM's office was informed through a letter that his speech would not be broadcast unless he \"reshaped it\".\n\nThe letter purportedly said, \"The message of the CM was closely examined by the competent authority. In view of the sanctity of the occasion, the broadcast code and responsibility of the public broadcaster it is not possible to telecast it in the present format.\"\n\n\"However, the DD/Prasar Bharati will be happy if the CM agrees to reshape the content making it suitable to the solemnity of the occasion and sentiment of the people,\" it purportedly said.\n\nThe CM's office statement claimed, \"The CM clearly stated that he would not change a single word and described it as unprecedented, undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant step.\"\n\nSarkar's speech was supposed to be broadcast on August 15 by the DD and the AIR in Tripura.\n\nCPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the DD was \"not the private property\" of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of \"instructing his cronies to black out voices\" of the opposition, including that of an elected CM.\n\nIn a statement, the CPI-M Politburo said it \"strongly condemns the refusal by the DD and the AIR to broadcast the customary Independence Day address of Sarkar\".\n\n\"The DD and the AIR had recorded his speech for the occasion. However, they subsequently informed him that the speech cannot be carried as it is and asked him to 'reshape' it,\" it said.\n\nThe party demanded action against those responsible for \"prohibiting\" the broadcast.\n\n\"This is a gross infringement on the right of a CM to address the people of his state on the Independence Day. This act is reminiscent of the Emergency days and goes beyond as it seeks to gag the elected CM of a state. The central government is trampling upon the autonomy of the DD/AIR and the Prasar Bharati by such acts of censorship,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Doordarshan Refuses to Broadcast Tripura CM Manik Sarkar's Speech. Is this the Cooperative Federalism that PM Modi Talks About? Shame!\" the CPI (M)'s official Twitter handle said.\n\nTagging the tweet, Yechury hit out at the central government saying the channel's alleged refusal to air Sarkar's speech was \"illegal\".\n\n\"PM can pay homilies to cooperative federalism while instructing his cronies to black out voices of the Opposition, including an elected CM.\n\n\"If this isn't authoritarianism & undeclared Emergency, what is? This will be fought back by the CPM, people of Tripura and all our citizens,\" the Marxist leader tweeted.\n\nThe controversy, which has already turned political, has come at a time when both the BJP and the CPI (M) are looking to win the upcoming Assembly elections, scheduled early next year. The CPI (M) has a strong hold over the state.

The public broadcasters had written to the Tripura CM asking him to \"reshape\" the content of his speech \"keeping in view the sanctity and solemnity attached with the occasion the broadcast is meant for.\" The official communique from Prasar Bharati to Akashbani Agartala had also said, \"The CEO, Prasar Bharati was also consulted and the collective decision taken at Delhi advises that the broadcast may not go with its existing content.\"\n\nWhen the Tripura CM refused to change his speech and lodged his protest, the speech that was recorded by DD and AIR on August 12 -- to be aired at 6 am on August 15 -- was not broadcast.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, a letter issued by UK Sahoo, office chief of Doordarshan Kendra, Agartala, overlooked Prasar Bharati's August 14 communique to the Tripura government asking the Tripura CM to carry out changes in his speech. In the August 16 letter, Sahoo said, \"I would like to state that the news unit of the local station of Doordarshan at Agartala has given wide coverage to the public address of the Hon'ble chief minister of Tripura and the development activities of the state government. On August 15, 2017, Doordarshan also gave wide coverage to the chief minister's Independence Day programme and telecast report running to 29 minutes and 45 seconds, out of which, the Hon'ble chief minister's speech coverage was for 12 minutes. This was telecast at 1900 hours.\" Sahoo also said the Doordarshan Kendra had been giving wide publicity to the CM's speeches for 25 years, since its inception.\n\nSahoo's note did not clarify whether he was referring to Sarkar's pre-recoded I-Day message, or a separate speech delivered on Independence Day.\n\nWhen TOI reached out to the Tripura government for confirmation, officials said the speech mentioned by DD Kendra Agartala was not the same the CM had recorded for playout on August 15. Senior government functionaries also said Manik Sarkar's disputed recorded message was six minutes long and it was difficult to understand, therefore, how DD could have played it out over 12 minutes. \"On the 71st Independence Day... the speech of CM of Tripura was recorded by DD and AIR Agartala, on their request, in the evening of 12 August in the office of the chief minister. It was scheduled to be broadcast through All India Radio and telecast by Doordarshan Kendra Agartala in the morning of 15th August, 2017....On 14 August, Prasar Bharati said...the recorded message could not be broadcast and telecast because...it was not befitting to the occasion of Independence Day.\"\n\nWhile the Tripura government did not deny that Sarkar's Independence Day address during the flag hoisting ceremony was aired, the CM's office added, \"DD Kendra Agartala have not responded in their refutal about their decision to ask the CM to reshape his recorded speech with CM denied to do. Prasar Bharati is now trying to mislead the people about their undemocratic and authoritarian stand.\"\n\nThe CPM, meanwhile, said it would use Prasar Bharati's ban on Tripura CM Manik Sarkar's I-Day speech to to intensify their efforts to cobble together a larger non-BJP opposition unity. The Left party had emphasised at the opposition meeting led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on August 11 that the opposition needed to build an alternative popular movement to counter the BJP. The chief minister's speech being banned has now offered the CPM an opportunity to lead an opposition attack against the ruling BJP.\n\nOn Wednesday, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said he will discuss the matter with other non-BJP chief ministers at the meeting convened by Sharad Yadav's on Thursday. \"I will have a conversation with the other chief ministers who are in attendance at Sharad Yadav's meeting. We will take a call on how to move forward against this authoritarianism. CPM will not cower before such censorship,\" he added.\n\nLeader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said, \"With each passing day, it has become hard for the Opposition parties to make their voices reach the people of the country. This type of censorship has not been seen in any country in the world. It is shameful for this government. They should just declare Emergency and impose news censorship so that we will at least know nothing can be shown because there is an Emergency, a prohibition.\"\n\nCPI general secretary Sudhakar Reddy, meanwhile, condemned the high-handed behavior of the state media asking the Tripura CM to amend his speech and refusing to broadcasting the same. \"It is not the business of the broadcasting authorities to demand to amend facts on unemployment, economic independence of the country and on the question of dividing the country by some vested interests,\" a statement issued by the Central Secretariat said.\n\nBOX:\n\nYechury questioned the government's appointment of the same individual as the chief executive officer of Prasar Bharati and of Rajya Sabha TV and said it made RS TV susceptible to serving as a mouthpiece of the government. Sharpening his attack on Prime Minister Modi and the BJP government, the CPM general secretary also referred to present-day India as the \"post-truth society\", where \"facts and reality don't matter; what matters is propaganda and personality cult.\"\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54715"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55711"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305067", "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312222", "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "314477", "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "321829", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "328660", "label": {"eng": "Sonia Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Nabi_Azad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "360882", "label": {"eng": "Ghulam Nabi Azad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitaram_Yechury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "363733", "label": {"eng": "Sitaram Yechury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "370471", "label": {"eng": "The Emergency (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "371808", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharad_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "389598", "label": {"eng": "Sharad Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "442276", "label": {"eng": "Doordarshan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "667899", "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD_Chennai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "685651", "label": {"eng": "DD Chennai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "1245029", "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}]}

The Centre is trampling upon the autonomy of Doordarshan/AIR and Prasar Bharati by such acts of censorship.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said DD's and AIR's behaviour was against \"cooperative federalism\" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about. \"Doordarshan is not the private property of the BJP or the RSS. Its refusal to broadcast Tripura CM's speech is undemocratic and illegal,\" he said.\n\nThe IANS news service quoted Mr. Sarkar as saying in his speech that India was yet to get economic independence. \"India got independence 70 years ago. Indians got political freedom, but they have not got economic independence yet,\" he said. He claimed that over 70 lakh workers were retrenched in one year and over 1.35 crore youths were jobless despite having professional degrees. \"The main political parties are misguiding the people, especially the youth, for their narrow political interests.

Written by Krishn Kaushik , Manoj CG | New Delhi | Updated: August 17, 2017 3:56 am Chief Minister of Tripura Manik Sarkar. (Express Photo) 15 held for heckling principal who hoisted flag wearing shoesCensoring SarkarThe speech that did not pass the AIR test\n\nA day after Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar's office said his Independence Day address was not aired by Doordarshan and All India Radio, which wanted him to \"reshape\" it, The Indian Express has learnt that Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan and AIR, did convey to Sarkar on August 15 morning what he shouldn't say in his speech.\n\nPart of Sarkar's unaired speech targeted the BJP -- he heads a Left Front government in the state.\n\nWithout naming any political party or organisation, Sarkar's speech mentioned that the \"spirit of secularism is under attack\" and \"conspiracies and attempts are under way to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the name of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religion country and in the name of protecting the cow\".\n\nThe speech also referred to minorities and Dalits being \"under severe attack\" and how \"their sense of security is being shattered\".\n\nPrasar Bharati was asked by its officials in Tripura to suggest what to do, and its senior officials in Delhi decided that the\n\nChief Minister's speech was against the Broadcast Code.\n\nOn the evening of August 14, Doordarshan and All India Radio had recorded Sarkar's speech. U K Sahoo, Doordarshan's protocol officer who was present during the recording, told The Indian Express that after the recording, he was asked by the Chief Minister to \"maintain the quality and content\" of his speech.\n\nSahoo felt that the speech was controversial, but Sarkar's words meant he could not edit it. He spoke to officials at Doordarshan's directorate in New Delhi who asked him to send across the text of the speech. Similar to Doordarshan, the text of Sarkar's speech was also sent to All India Radio's headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nAt the AIR headquarters, a committee of four senior officers pondered on the contents of the speech. AIR Director General Fayyaz Sheheryar consulted Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati on what should be done.\n\nThe committee and Vempati decided that the speech did not adhere to the Broadcast Code, and told their office in Agartala that the Chief Minister will need to \"reshape the content\" of his speech, otherwise the \"broadcast may not go with its existing content\", keeping in view the \"sanctity and solemnity\" of Independence Day.\n\nSenior officials at Prasar Bharati maintained that the public broadcaster never asks \"suo motu\" for speeches of Chief Ministers.\n\nSanjiv Dosajh, Assistant Director of Programmes (Policy) at AIR, who emailed AIR's Agartala office about the committee's decision, told The Indian Express that when the station director finds some content \"objectionable\", the speech is sent to the directorate in Delhi.\n\nDosajh said in the past too, CMs have been advised to \"modify\" some speeches, to which they agreed -- he cited no example.\n\n\"This time,\" Dosajh said of Sarkar, \"he was very firm he would not change (it)\".\n\nHe said the committee found a few \"instances\" in Sarkar's speech which were not \"very positive\", keeping in mind the occasion. He said the AIR broadcast code says \"speech should not be hostile\" which, the committee felt, was the case with Sarkar's speech.\n\nBut the AIR and Doordarshan's Broadcast Code does not mention \"hostile speech\" at all. It says that no content should be aired that criticises friendly countries, attacks any religion or community, is obscene or defamatory, incites violence or goes against law and order, amounts to contempt of court, casts aspersions against the integrity of the President or judiciary, or can affect the integrity of the country and criticises any person by name.\n\nOn receiving the response from their directorates, both Doordarshan and AIR informed the Tripura Chief Minister's office about the decision.\n\nSahoo said he had emailed the Chief Minister's staff on the evening of August 14, but did not receive a response.\n\nThe next morning, between 9 am and 9.30 am, when both the Governor's and the Chief Minister's speeches were to be broadcast, only the Governor's speech was aired. In a press statement Wednesday, Doordarshan said that it did cover Sarkar's Independence Day-related events, including another speech he made on August 15.\n\nThe CPI(M) criticised the government for not airing Sarkar's speech. Party general secretary Sitaram Yechury, at a press conference, said the Prime Minister or the Chief Ministers have the right to speak. \"If they have said anything objectionable, they will be questioned in Parliament or in state legislatures. What the Chief Minister would have said in his address, that would have been questioned on the floor of the Tripura Assembly. You cannot pre-emptively censor him.\"\n\nCalling it worse than the Emergency days, he said what Prasar Bharati has done is \"reminiscent not only of the Emergency of Indira Gandhi... when there was censorship of a very high level... this has gone further than that and worse than that.\"\n\nGhulam Nabi Azad, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, told reporters: \"With each passing day, it has become very hard for the Opposition parties to make their voice reach the people of the country. This type of censorship has been seen by no country in the world. This is shameful for this government. Why don't they declare Emergency straightaway for the news censorship of the media, so that at least we will have some solace, we will have some sort of satisfaction: OK, nothing can come because there is Emergency, nothing comes because this is prohibited.\"\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Independence Day Manik Sarkar", "date": "2017-08-16",

Apart from this the chief minister's speech and Independence Day programme in various districts of Tripura were given wide publicity in the regional news bulletin.\n\nDoordarshan further stated since last 25 years the Kendra is giving wide publicity to speeches of chief minister and government programmes.\n\nCongress has also criticized the move to censor chief minister's speech.\n\nAn official statement from the Chief Minister's Office said that All India Radio (AIR) and Doordarshan Kendra (DDK), Agartala, recorded Sarkar's speech on August 12 to broadcast and telecast it on August 15.\n\n\"On August 14 evening Assistant Director of Programmes (Policy) Sanjiv Dosajh of AIR, New Delhi, and Prasar Bharati's Head of Office (New Delhi) U.K. Sahoo in separate communications to the Chief Minister's Office said that with the existing contents the speech could not be telecast and broadcast by AIR and DDK, Agartala,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The AIR and Prasar Bharati officials had suggested reshaping the content of the Chief Minister's speech making it suitable to the solemnity of the occasion and sentiments of the people of India at large. The Chief Minister refused to make any change of his speech,\" the statement added.\n\nSarkar is the chief minister of Tripura for last 19 years. Senior Left leader Sarkar is a Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) politburo member and public broadcaster in earlier occasions has telecasted his speeches.\n\nLeft Front leaders criticised the decision of the Prasar Bharati.\n\nThe text of chief minister's speech released states, \"Before us on this year's Independence Day are quite a few very relevant, important and contemporary issues.Unity in diversity is India's traditional heritage. Great values of secularism have helped in keeping Indians together as a nation. But today, this spirit of secularism is under attack. Conspiracies and attempts are underway to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the\n\nname of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religious country and in the name of protecting the cow. Because of all these people of Minority and Dalit communities are under severe attack. Their sense of security is being shattered. Their life is under peril.\"\n\nThe speech added, \"These unholy tendencies cannot be harboured or tolerated. These disruptive attempts are contrary to the goals,dreams and ideals of our freedom struggle. The followers of those who were not associated with the Independence movement, rather sabotaged the freedom movement, were servile to the atrocious, plunderer and merciless British, aligned with the anti-national forces having decorated themselves today in different names and colours are striking at the root of unity and integrity of India.\"\n\nTripura chief minister further said, \"In contrast to the anti-people policies of the Government at the Centre, the State Government of Tripura despite its limitations has been pursuing policies for the\n\nwelfare of people in all walks of life with a special focus on the downtrodden and to advance forward with their cooperation. This is a totally different and an alternative path. This path has been able to not only attract the people of Tripura but also elicit a positive response of the downtrodden people of our country. This is not being tolerated by the reactionary forces here in Tripura. Hence, conspiracies are being hatched up one after another by the enemies of the people to disturb peace, fraternity and integrity of the State. And at the same time attempts are on to disrupt the realm of developmental works.\"\n\nMrinal Kanti Deb, spokesperson of Tripura BJP unit told ET, \"Sarkar has no sense of what to speak and where.

Then a letter was sent to him, saying that they (Prasar Bharti) will be glad to show it only if he reshapes the text of his address.\n\n\"This is reminiscent of not only Mrs Indira Gandhi's Emergency, when there was a press censorship of a very high level, but this has become even worse than that,\" Yechury told reporters here.\n\nTo buttress his point, Yechury said no chief minister was disallowed from speaking on the occasion of Independence or Republic Day during the Emergency (imposed between 1975 and 1977).\n\n\"But what has been done, is therefore, a precursor to very big authoritarian onslaught and a censorship of the media that this government is embarking upon which is completely not permissible and this will be fought,\" he added.\n\nThe Left leader said Prasar Bharti's decision to \"block\" Sarkar's customary address was also a \"gross interference\" in the right of the states.\n\nHe said that asking the head of state, Sarkar, to speak \"only what is in consonance\" with the Centre's understanding on the said occasions was \"tantamount to undermining\" the federal principles of the Constitution.\n\n\"What the chief minister speaks about, he is answerable in the state assembly,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Yechury also tweeted on the issue saying, \"Neither Modi's cronies at Prasar Bharti nor BJP or RSS, have any locus standi to decide on what an elected CM of a state speaks on August 15\".\n\nHe further told reporters that the CPI(M) is talking to all non-BJP governments to \"realise this is how the authoritarian path is being pushed forward\".\n\nYechury alleged Sarkar's speech was blocked even though the RSS chief's Vijayadashmi address was broadcast by Doordarshan following a \"very very partisan\" approach.\n\nHe also claimed that the press conference addressed by an RSS leader on the \"attacks on Sangh workers\", allegedly by the CPI(M) in Kerala, was also aired live.\n\n\"What does this mean? That only one point of view will have to be shown to the people and that will be decided by the powers that be,\" he added.\n\nHe also raised questions over Bhagwat hoisting the flag on Independence Day yesterday at a Kerala school rather than at the RSS office.\n\nIn Agartala, Tripura CPI-M secretary Bijan Dhar accused the Centre of curbing the autonomy of Prasar Bharati after Sarkar's allegation that Doordarshan and All India Radio had refused to broadcast his speech unless he \"reshaped\" it.\n\n\"This is a gross infringement on the rights of a chief minister to address the people of his state on Independence Day\", Dhar said.\n\n\"This only reminds us of the black days of Emergency and goes beyond as it seeks to gag the elected chief minister of a state. The central government is curbing the autonomy of Doordarshan/AIR and Prasar Bharati by such acts of censorship,\" he alleged.\n\nThe in-charge of Doordarshan, Agartala, U K Sahoo has said, \"Though his (Sarkar's) recorded speech was not broadcast, his speech on Independence Day at Assam Rifles parade ground here was covered by Doordarshan and broadcast in the form of news.\n\n\"We are always covering the chief minister's programmes.\n\nThere is no question of a black-out,\" he said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53687"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55711"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304234", "label": {"eng": "Mass media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305067", "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305553", "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309640", "label": {"eng": "RSS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "321829", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "328624", "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340238", "label": {"eng": "Buttress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitaram_Yechury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "363733", "label": {"eng": "Sitaram Yechury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "370471", "label": {"eng": "The Emergency (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "442276", "label": {"eng": "Doordarshan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohan_Bhagwat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "471524", "label": {"eng": "Mohan Bhagwat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsanghchalak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "471526", "label": {"eng": "Sarsanghachalak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "1245029", "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}]}

On August 15, 2017, DD also gave wide coverage to the CM's Independence Day programme and telecast the report running to 29 minutes and 45 seconds, out of which, the Hon'ble CM's speech coverage was for 12 minutes. This was telecast at 1900 hours.\"\n\nSahoo also said the Doordarshan Kendra had been giving wide publicity to the CM's speeches for 25 years, since its inception.\n\nThe official's note, however, did not refer to the message that the Tripura CM had recorded on August 12 and which was to be broadcast on August 15. DD and AIR had raised objections to Sarkar's charge about attempt to impose a Hindu theocracy in the name of cow and refused to air the message after the Marxist CM refused to reshape his speech.\n\nIn his message recorded on August 12 and later circulated through the information department of the state government, Sarkar said, \"A conspiracy is hatched to create a division by trying to transform India into a state believing in a particular religion and spreading message of Gau Raksha. The minority and Dalit communities are being attacked and denied security and the Centre's anti-people policy was affecting peace and tranquility.\"\n\nPrasar Bharati officials in Tripura justified the changes asked of Sarkar, saying that the norms clearly require CMs and other functionaries to refrain from making political speeches when they get to address people on public broadcasters.

News18's Sujith Nath spoke to Sarkar about the controversy. Edited Excerpts:\n\nThere is a lot of controversy surrounding your Independence Day speech. There was an alleged deliberate attempt to suppress your voice. What you have to say on this?\n\nWe have examined Doordarshan's letter which they have addressed to the press (yesterday) and a copy which we have also received. While going through the letter, we found that they have not said anything with regard to my speech which was recorded on August 12. Doordarshan and AIR were supposed to broadcast/telecast my speech on Independence Day but they kept mum. They recorded my speech but where is it?\n\nDid they actually ask you to reshape your Independence Day speech?\n\nYes. They asked me to reshape my speech. Now they can say many thing but that was the point of discord. I told them that I am not going to change my Independence Day speech. It was not possible.\n\nDo you think Doordarshan is telling the truth in its defense or do you think that they are lying?\n\nThat is the point. They recorded my speech but didn't broadcast it. On that count, now you should judge whether they are lying or trying to mislead the people or not. I have not passed any comment but everything is clear based on reality.\n\nDoordarshan is claiming that they covered the event widely in Tripura. Are you saying that your speech which was recorded in August 12 was not telecasted?\n\nThey (Doordarshan) as a news service have to cover many things. And they covered the Independence Day event.

Unity in diversity is India's traditional heritage. Great values of secularism have helped in keeping Indians together as a nation. But today, this spirit of secularism is under attack.\"\n\nRelated: Doordarshan, AIR blacked out my Independence Day speech, told me reshape it: Tripura CM Manik Sarkar\n\nYou can read his entire speech below:\n\nSarkar, who is heading the Left Front government in the state, spoke about cow vigilantism and minority issues among other things in his address. \"Conspiracies and attempts are underway to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society....by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religious country and in the name of protecting the cow. Because of all these people of Minority and Dalit communities are under attack.\" Reiterating former Vice-president Hamid Ansari's view, Sarkar also said, \"Their sense of security is being shattered.\"\n\nTaking a veiled dig at RSS, Sarkar said that \"the followers of these disruptive attempts\" were not \"associated with the Independence movement, rather sabotaged the freedom movement, were servile to the atrocious, plunderer and merciless British.\"\n\nA statement from the Tripura government said DD and AIR had recorded Sarkar's speech on Saturday. At 7 pm Monday, the Chief Minister's Office was informed via a letter that his speech would not be broadcasted unless he \"reshaped it\". The letter purportedly said, \"The message of the Chief Minister was closely examined by competent authority. In view of the sanctity of the occasion, the broadcast code and responsibility of the public broadcaster it is not possible to telecast it in the present format. However, Doordarshan/Prasar Bharati will be happy if the Chief Minister agrees to reshape the content making it suitable to the solemnity of the occasion and sentiment of the people,\" it said.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Independence Day Manik Sarkar", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment", "wgt": 100, "id": 402, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sr\u012bnagar"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sr\u012bnagar"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51735"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55019"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304327", "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305067", "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305523", "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308343", "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308370", "label": {"eng": "Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321829", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Raina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "385292", "label": {"eng": "Suresh Raina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "413385", "label": {"eng": "Kashmiri Pandit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "442276", "label": {"eng": "Doordarshan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Hamid_Ansari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "488262", "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Hamid Ansari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Tripura", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "968427", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of Tripura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "1245029", "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devendra_Fadnavis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1271981", "label": {"eng": "Devendra Fadnavis"}}]}

Reuters\n\nHere is the full text of Sarkar's speech:\n\nDear People of Tripura\n\nOn the occasion of Independence Day, I convey my greetings and best wishes to you all. I pay my homage to the great memory of the martyrs of India's freedom struggle. I would also like to offer my profound regards to those freedom fighters who are amongst us today.\n\nCelebration of Independence Day is not just a ceremonial occasion. Keeping in view the historical significance and tremendous emotional attachment to this day for Indians, it has to be treated as an important ceremonial occasion for national introspection.\n\nBefore us on this year's Independence Day are quite a few relevant. important and contemporary issues.\n\nUnity in diversity is India's traditional heritage. Great values of secularism base helped in keeping Indians together as a nation. But today, this spirit of secularism is under attack. Conspiracies and attempts are underway to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the name of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religious country and in the name of protecting the cow Because of all these people of Minority and Dalit communities arc under severe attack. Their sense of security is being shattered. Their life is under peril. These unholy tendencies cannot be harboured or tolerated. These disruptive attempts are contrary to the goals, dreams and ideals of our freedom struggle. The followers of those who were not associated with the Independence movement, rather sabotaged the freedom movement, were servile to the atrocious. plunderer and merciless British, aligned with the anti-national forces having decorated themselves today in different names and colours are striking at the root of unity and integrity of India. Every loyal and patriotic Indian must take the pledge today to remain committed to the ideal of a united India and to counter the attempts towards such destructive conspiracies and attacks. We must all work and collectively strive to ensure security of the Minorities. (Dalits and preserve the unity and integrity of our country.\n\nToday, the gulf between the have and have nots is speedily widening. Nation's vast resources and wealth arc being concentrated in the hands of a very few. A large majority of our people are suffering from poverty. These people are the victims of inhuman exploitation. They are being deprived of food, shelter. clothing, education, health care and security of job for assured income. This is contrary to the aims and objectives of our Independence struggle. Our current national policies are squarely responsible for this state of affairs. Such anti-people policies shall have to be reversed. But words alone will not achieve this. For this, we need the deprived and the suffering Indians to arise, become vocal and to protest fearlessly, collectively in a ceaseless manner. We definitely need an alternative policy that serves the interests of the vast majority of Indians. To bring this alternative policy into reality, the deprived and suffering Indians need to take a pledge on this Independence Day to launch an economic, political and social movement unitedly in a broadway.\n\nThe mounting problem of unemployment has created a sense of despondency and gloom in our national psyche. On one hand. lakhs of employed are loosing their jobs. On the other hand, crores of unemployed youth are waiting for jobs, which is nothing but like a mirage to them. It is not possible to solve this gigantic national problem without reversing the national economic policies which work to strengthen the very small group of profiteering corporates, and without increasing the purchasing power of the common people of India. Hence, the students, youth and working classes will have to take a pledge on this Independence Day to launch a collective and continuous movement to reverse these destructive policies.\n\nIn contrast to the anti-people policies of the Government at the Centre, the State Government of Tripura despite its limitations has been pursuing policies for the welfare of people in all walks of life with a special focus on the downtrodden and to advance forward with their cooperation. This is a totally different and an alternative path. This path has been able to not only attract the people of Tripura but also elicit a positive response of the downtrodden people of our country. This is not being tolerated by the reactionary forces here in Tripura. Hence, conspiracies are being hatched up one after another by the enemies of the people to disturb peace, fraternity and integrity of the State. And at the same time attempts are on to disrupt the realm of developmental works. We need to counter all these unholy designs and isolate the reactionary forces. In this background, on this Independence Day, all the right thinking, peace loving and development seeking people of Tripura need to take a determined pledge to come forward and to work unitedly against such disruptive forces.\n\nThe entire speech has been reproduced from the official CPM Twitter account and has not been edited by Firstpost.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 08:25 am | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 08:26 am\n\nTags :#All india radio#Bjp#Cpm#Doordarshan#Independence day#Manik sarkar#Narendra modi#Sitaram yechury#Theysaidit#Tripura", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 100, "id": 494, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304273", "label": {"eng": "Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304327", "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305523", "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308343", "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "308732", "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309639", "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "321829", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "333522", "label": {"eng": "Social movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitaram_Yechury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "363733", "label": {"eng": "Sitaram Yechury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "412935", "label": {"eng": "Mirage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "442276", "label": {"eng": "Doordarshan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tripura", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "709470", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tripura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "1245029", "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}]}

Image courtesy PIB\n\n\"The Left Front has condemned this incident and called upon the people to rise and protest. Where does Prasar Bharati get the right to ignore the speech of an elected chief minister? By doing that, they have undermined the people of the state. We will launch a 15-day campaign against the Centre protesting the treatment meted out to the Tripura chief minister,\" CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar told Firstpost from Agartala.\n\nThe CPM state secretary denied that the speech of the chief minister was a tirade against the Centre. \"There was no mention of any government or any party. The chief minister has every right to air his views as he felt. This is what he felt was happening in the country and so he gave his views accordingly. Prasar Bharati has no authority to reject a speech made by a chief minister. This is a democratic country and people have the right to give their views,\" Dhar said.\n\nDespite the claims made by the CPM state secretary, however, it was quite obvious for the politically-inclined that the speech did target the BJP and Right-wing fringe elements.\n\n\"Conspiracies and attempts are underway to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the name of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religious country and in the name of protecting cow,\" Sarkar had apparently said in his Independence Day speech which was shared by CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Twitter.\n\n\"In contrast to the anti-people policies of the government at the Centre, the state government of Tripura, despite its limitations, has been pursuing policies for the welfare of the people in all walks of life with a special focus on the downtrodden, and to advance their cooperation forward,\" the Tripura chief minister said.\n\nThe text of the Independence Day speech by Tripura CM, Manik Sarkar: blacked out by DD & AIR after orders from Delhi. #UndeclaredEmergencypic.twitter.com/90ECzoqLMQ\n\n-- Sitaram Yechury (@SitaramYechury) August 16, 2017\n\nAnnoyed by the accusations against the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, the BJP reacted sharply to the Tripura chief minister.\n\n\"Whatever he said it is highly objectionable. The speech during the flag hoisting has to be non-political. The chief minister must talk about achievements and challenges. What he did was criticise the Centre in extremely bad words. The Tripura chief minister was mannerless in his conduct. However, we have not decided on our next course of action,\" said BJP central observer for Tripura, Sunil Deodhar.\n\nThis has since snowballed into a huge controversy, particularly since the state will hold Assembly elections early next year. Stakes are already high, with the BJP making deep inroads into the Left bastion, hitherto well protected by Sarkar, the man who is in his 19th consecutive year as chief minister.\n\nBJP has made its intentions quite clear, as six MLAs of the Trinamool Congress and one from Congress broke ranks to join the saffron party recently.\n\n\"CPM cadres are joining our party on a daily basis. Some of the CPM MLAs are also in touch with us quietly but they cannot say so in public because of the code of conduct,\" Deodhar said.\n\nIn the 60-member Tripura Assembly, CPM has 49 MLAs while the BJP has six legislators after they quit the Trinamool Congress en masse to join the BJP. The party did not win a single seat in the 2013 Assembly election.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 08:42 pm | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 08:42 pm\n\nTags :#Bjp#Congress#Independence day#Manik sarkar#Narendra modi#Politics#Politicsdecoder#States#Tripura", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54715"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55711"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305752", "label": {"eng": "Chief Minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "308732", "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "314477", "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Front_(India)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "321826", "label": {"eng": "Left Front (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "321828", "label": {"eng": "All India Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "321829", "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitaram_Yechury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "363733", "label": {"eng": "Sitaram Yechury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "390297", "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "442276", "label": {"eng": "Doordarshan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "1245029", "label": {"eng": "All India Radio"}}]}

If it was not, the government must say so. The speech that did not pass the AIR testIndependence Day: This is the speech of Manik Sarkar that DD, AIR refused to broadcastDoordarshan, AIR blacked out my Independence Day speech, told me reshape it: Tripura CM Manik Sarkar\n\nThe blackout by Doordarshan and AIR of the customary Independence Day speech of Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar casts a dark shadow the day after. By all accounts, after a local official raised an objection, the decision not to broadcast the CM's speech -- unless it was \"reshaped\" -- was taken at Prasar Bharati's Delhi office. In arrogating to itself the powers of a censor over an elected chief minister, the public broadcaster has revived serious questions about its mandate, its degree of autonomy from political-governmental control, and its very relevance in a quick-changing media environment.\n\nThere is, to be sure, a broadcasting code that schoolmarmishly sets its face against an array of perceived discourtesies and transgressions, ranging from \"criticism of friendly countries\" to \"anything obscene or defamatory\", to \"anything affecting the integrity of the nation\". But that such an imprecise and loosely worded code should be invoked by the public broadcaster to curb the freedom of an elected CM to talk to the people on a day the nation celebrates its freedoms, is outrageous. The speech itself -- excerpted today on the Ideas Page - could, at worst, be described as politically charged. Without naming any party or individual, Sarkar spoke of a secularism \"under attack\", and of \"conspiracies and attempts\" to create \"divisions in society\" that are \"contrary to the goals, dreams and ideals of our freedom struggle\". In fact, the chief minister's speech was no more political than any speech made by any of his counterparts in other states on the day.\n\nDespite a 20-year-long career, and reports and recommendations of several committees, the Prasar Bharati is yet to restructure its operations either to respond to the requirements of changing times, or to establish a record of impartiality and fairplay. Successive governments have also been reluctant to give up control over a captive medium. The censorship in Agartala, therefore, immediately invites suspicions about the role of the Central government in the blackout of an Opposition leader. The NDA is particularly vulnerable to these charges, of course. In its three years in power, it has shown a distinctive intolerance of dissent and the political opponent. It has carried this into spaces that must be insulated from the zero-sum games of electoral battle, and that call for political give-and-take. It has taken recourse to the logic of majoritarianism to have its way even in institutions that must be governed by constitutional norms and principles not subject to the numbers game. It is easy to believe that it was NDA diktat that led to the blacking out of Manik Sarkar on DD and AIR in Tripura on I-Day. If it was not, the government must say so.\n\nFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: freedom of speech Manik Sarkar NDA government", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "wgt": 100, "id": 855, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54715"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55711"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305067", "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305752", "label": {"eng": "Chief Minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308343", "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "442276", "label": {"eng": "Doordarshan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}]}

Conspiracies and attempts are underway to create an undesirable complexity and divisions in our society; to invade our national consciousness in the name of religion, caste and community, by inciting passions to convert India into a particular religious country and in the name of protecting the cow.\"\n\nThe Tripura CM, who has commandeered the north-eastern state for the last 19 years, also said, \"These unholy tendencies cannot be harboured or tolerated.

The fact of the matter is that when we checked with multiple sources, there was no black out of his speech as is being reported. In fact his public speech was covered extensively.

It is a day for national introspection. Written by Manoj C G | Published:August 18, 2017 5:28 am Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar inspects 71st Independence Day parade in Agartala. PTI Photo Ten year-old rape victim delivers baby girl, told she has a stone inside herRetired HC judge to probe J Jayalalithaa death: CM E K PalaniswamiMalayalam actress abduction case: Remya Nambeesan, who called Dileep's arrest 'historic', gives statement to cops\n\nTripura CM Manik Sarkar speaks to The Indian Express about Prasar Bharati not broadcasting his speech\n\nQ. How do you see Prasar Bharati's decision not to broadcast you Independence Day message on Doordarshan and AIR?\n\nA. This is thoroughly undemocratic, authoritarian and expression of intolerance.\n\nQ. Why do you call it an expression of intolerance?\n\nA. Because in the speech, what they have mentioned is that it not befitting the gravity of a national Independence Day. I do not know how they came to this conclusion. National Independence Day, in my humble experience, is not just a simple ritual function. It is a day for national introspection. What were the aims and objectives of the struggle for freedom? Our freedom fighters, they had some dreams. So on this particular day, it is the job of the citizens of the nation to go for introspection to assess the objectives, aims, dreams and how far it has been translated into action at the grassroots level. Where are the gaps and why there are gaps. How to bridge all these things to achieve our objectives and goals. All these things will have to be done. Keeping that in mind, I made two-three points in my speech. In this situation, how have they come to this conclusion that it is not befitting the gravity of national Independence Day. Who are they to assess all these things. And they have asked a Chief Minister to reshape his speech. They have crossed all limits. This is not proper. This is actually nothing but gagging, not the Chief Minister alone. They are going to gag civil liberties. That cannot be done. This is wrong.\n\nQ. CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has called this an attack on federalism. He said all the the non-BJP state governments should join together to save centre-state relations as envisaged in the Constitution and spoke about getting in touch with Chief Ministers. Have you spoken to any of the non-BJP chief ministers?\n\nA. No, I have not spoken. At this moment, I am not thinking. What I have done, in my humble view, is to bring to the notice of common people what is going on in our country and society just to make them aware of what is going on. A lurking danger is there. I though that if I had kept mum, it would not be proper. That is why I have done it.\n\nQ. Prasar Bharati stressed on the solemnity of the occasion. The counter argument is that you gave a political speech?\n\nA. Independence Day is a political day. What is it? On that particular day, the speech must be political. That will depend on the understanding of the person who is making the speech. I thought it is a political day, my speech must be political. More so, I am a political worker. What is wrong in it?\n\nQ. You must have given Independence Day messages in the past also. What was the difference then and now?\n\nA. Not like this. Last year the situation was different. Year before last, the situation was different. Factoring the relevance of the ongoing situation, I make my points. Last year, this sort of speech was not delivered. It was in a question-answer format.\n\nQ. What has changed in the last one year?\n\nA. I have dealt with that in my speech.\n\nQ. Three years have passed since the BJP came to power. The perception is that BJP is gaining from strength to strength if one go by its electoral successes and the opposition appears to be weakening or in disarray? Even today, the BJP came second in municipal elections in West Bengal.\n\nA. People of Bengal could not find the opportunity to exercise their franchise. That is the reality. About the national situation, if everything is alright....what happened last month...more than 200 districts of the farming community? States which are run by the BJP. What about the working class.... Recently in Talkatora stadium they had a national convention.... Thousands of people assembled there and they declared their programme. In the coming days, they are going to organise a big demonstration. On what issue? What is going on in the universities, on college campuses. The minority, trading community, everybody is aggrieved. What is going on. Lakhs and lakhs are losing their jobs and crores and crores of people are actually joining the queue for jobs. And where are the jobs? So, it is a mirage. This is the situation. On all this, people have started voicing their resentment and that is why coming out into the streets and movements have started taking shape. From all this experience, one can easily draw a conclusion about what is going on. In this situation, if anybody thinks that by gagging X or Y, he will be in a safe position, it will not happen. People cannot be suppressed this way.\n\nQ. The BJP is aggressively reaching out to the tribal community. Does that worry you? It has tasted success in several northeastern states already.\n\nA. It has been going on since long. Slogans of independent states were raised. Ouster of foreigners -- that slogan was raised. Communal tension was mounted, riots were also organised. The people of Tripura fought back all these, got peace, tranquility, strengthened democracy and taken it to the grassroots.... As far as northeastern states (are concerned), Tripura is Tripura. The state cannot be equated with any other state. Every state has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses.... So one state cannot be equated with another.\n\nQ. The BJP is making an aggressive bid in Tripura. How confident are you about the coming election?\n\nA. We have full confidence in our people and people have their confidence on us. Because we are not doing anything against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state. That is why we have that confidence. People will act according to their experience in daily life.\n\nQ. What should the opposition do now? At the national level there is talk about opposition unity.\n\nA. Unity cannot develop without an alternative set of policies. Even if the set of policies are identified, unity will not develop until and unless to achieve these policies... there is an united struggle. Unity cannot develop only between the leaders, discussion, arriving at certain understanding and conclusions. That has to be taken to the grassroots. People have been facing, they have been suffering, they should be mobilised on the ground itself. Mass struggle, class struggle ceaselessly on the basis of alternative set of policies.\n\nQ. How is it possible with parties which have different sets of ideologies and policies?\n\nA. That is there. That understanding, unity of understanding on each and every issue, that cannot be, may not be (possible). Issues may very, very limited but let us start with this. Wherever we have an understanding, let us start with that. That way, gradually it will develop.\n\nQ. Is it possible for the CPM to have an understanding with the Congress or for that matter, Trinamool Congress?\n\nA. If the Congress changes its economic policies, then that can be thought of. If they stick to their earlier position, because of which they have been ousted from the seat of power, what they have lost they will further lose. They shall also have to apply their mind to this particular aspect. We cannot advise the Congress. It is the leadership of the Congress. They shall have to think about it. We can at best express our mind. If they change, then people at the grassroots level will decide.\n\nQ. So is that a pre-condition for unity?\n\nA. This policy -- neo-liberal economic policy -- that has created all this disaster. It is being implemented in an aggressive manner by the present government. That is causing a lot of problems -- working class, peasantry, youth, students, SC/STs, small and marginal traders. Only a small minority, the corporate sector, is benefiting. Good days have come for them. Others are under attack either in this way or that way. Under this situation, the political parties all of a sudden cannot change. But if gradually, issue by issue, they start thinking about all these things... then only it (unity) can develop.\n\nQ. At a critical time when the opposition should be unitedly taking on the Government in Parliament, it was amusing to see that your party decided to keep one of your most powerful speakers, Sitaram Yechury, out of Parliament. Why did you do that?\n\nA. That was a party decision. That has been explained. That is my view also\n\nQ. But many leaders in the opposition were surprised when they heard that Yechury would not be returning to Rajya Sabha\n\nA. Sitaram Yechury is our general secretary. Yes he is not there in Parliament. What is that. But he is there in our party headquarters. He is moving around in states. He is moving around the country. What is the problem. He can actually deliver goods, he can take the message to the people.\n\nQ. Shouldn't the rigidity in our party end?\n\nA. This is not rigidity. Actually he is the party general secretary and we thought he should give more time to the party organisation and other political activities. Nothing else. About his quality, he has proved in the floor of Parliament. About that nobody is raising any questions. That is appreciated. But party thought that he should give more time to the party organisation and other political activities. And that is what he has been doing.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label":

It also talked about the Lieutenant Governors of Andaman and Nicobar Island and also took the names of two other LGs,\" he added.\n\n\"It did not take the name of West Bengal's Chief Minister. It is a matter of shame that they are being selective in taking the names of Chief Ministers so openly,\" Azad said.\n\n\"Today, there is an undeclared Emergency on radio, television and newspapers,\" he added.\n\nAzad also said: \"With each passing day, it has become very hard for the opposition parties to make their voices reach the people of the country. This type of censorship is not seen anywhere in the world. This is shameful for this government.\n\n\"Why don't they declare Emergency straightaway for the news censorship of the media? We will at least have some solace and satisfaction that nothing can come because there is Emergency. Nothing will appear because this is prohibited,\" he added.\n\nTripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar on Wednesday condemned the censorship of his Independence Day speech by national broadcaster Prasar Bharati and termed it an \"undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant step\".\n\nPrasar Bharati on Wednesday refuted it as \"totally incorrect\".\n\n--IANS\n\nsid-akk/rn\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 100, "id": 595, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51434"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Tripura"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51525"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54026"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55574"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303038", "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304059", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304968", "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305067", "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305741", "label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305752", "label": {"eng": "Chief Minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306726", "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "314477", "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330537", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_West_Bengal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340152", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Nabi_Azad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "360882", "label": {"eng": "Ghulam Nabi Azad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "370471", "label": {"eng": "The Emergency (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "389332", "label": {"eng": "Chief Minister (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manik_Sarkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "408743", "label": {"eng": "Manik Sarkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasar_Bharati", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "549678", "label": {"eng": "Prasar Bharati"}}]}

Spain provide final opposition after beating Chile in the other last-four clash and Ireland will likely have to defy the odds once again in Terrassa \u2013 they\u2019re winless in their last five meetings against the Spanish, who are positioned three places higher in the world rankings, including a 5-1 defeat only six days ago. \"I think today it was a bit of a battle,\u201d said Hankshaw after yesterday\u2019s win. \u201cWe knew that we had set ourselves up for a battle, and I think it took a lot of resilience to get through that. Very proud of all the players and support staff. \"We knew that wasn't the real Ireland team that showed up in the opening game with Spain, and that performance was not going to define us in this tournament. We've learned a lot since then. We're going to bring a new set of positives into tomorrow and we'll be ready (for the final).\" IRELAND:- Liz Murphy (GK) ; Elena Neill, Sarah McAuley; Rois\u00edn Upton; Ellen Curran; Sarah Torrans; Charlotte Beggs; Katie McKee; Michelle Carey; Naomi Carroll; Katie Mullan (C) SUBS USED:- Hannah McLoughlin [ 5 mins] ; Caoimhe Perdue [ 4 mins ]; Sarah Hawkshaw [ 5 mins ]; Christina Hamill [ 5 mins] ; Niamh Carey [3 mins ]; SiofraO'Brien [ 6 mins]", "summary": "Sarah Hawkshaw says Ireland are taking a \u201cnew set of positives\u201d into this evening\u2019s FIH Women\u2019s Nations Cup final showdown against hosts Spain.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/other-sport/sarah-hawkshaw-says-ireland-taking-new-set-of-positives-into-fih-womens-nations-cup-final-against-spain-4658751", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmY0NjlmMWY4LTJlYWItNDgwNy1iZDczLTc2MDRkNmUyZGU5ZDpmODBhNTQ1Ny02MzQxLTQzODQtOTFjZi1iNWQ5OGM4YWU5ZGU=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:19:15", "author": "Johnny Morton", "authors": ["Johnny Morton"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.053}

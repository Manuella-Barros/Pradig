Lee McMonagle was the star man for the Letterkenny side, heading home the opening goal after the half hour mark and leaving Letterkenny up 1-0 at half time. However the game would soon truly come to life, Paul Boyle slotting home for Keadue on 55 minutes to leave the sides tied. Keadue would quickly be fighting from behind again though, a foul on Lee McMonagle from Matthew Smith earned the Keadue man an early bath with his second yellow card. The Letterkenny man slotted home his second from the penalty spot subsequently. However Keadue were far from out, and despite being down to 10 men a quickfire double from Peter McGee fired them within minutes of an improbable cup win with just minutes to spare. Letterkenny would then pull off an improbable comeback of their own, as Aidy Delap converted from a corner with two minutes to go in regulation. And then in the 90th minute, Lee McMonagle completed his cup final hat-trick by heading home an unbelievable winner. A truly memorable final, with Letterkenny Rovers leaving as 2024 Brian McCormick Cup champions.", "summary": "<p>Letterkenny Rovers 4 v 3 Keadue Rovers Letterkenny Rovers won a dramatic Brian McCormick Cup Final this afternoon in Ballyare,&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/05/26/letterkenny-rovers-win-dramatic-mccormick-cup-final/\">Letterkenny Rovers win dramatic McCormick Cup Final</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/05/26/letterkenny-rovers-win-dramatic-mccormick-cup-final/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/436421720_989309519430307_447643862649761647_n-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:53:12", "author": "Staff Writer", "authors": ["Staff Writer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.084}

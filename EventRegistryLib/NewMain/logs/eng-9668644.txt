One of his most recent roles was in Lawmen: Bass Reeves alongside David Oyelowo.\n\nSutherland was married three times.

The 1970s was a noteworthy decade for the star, who starred in Don't Look Now, 1900, and National Lampoon's Animal House.

One of his most recent roles was in Lawmen: Bass Reeves alongside David Oyelowo.\n\nSutherland was married three times.

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's M.A.S.H., the hippie tank commander in Kelly's Heroes and the stoned professor in Animal House.\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomised the unpredictable, anti-establishment cinema of the 1970s.\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down - but still eccentric - parts in Robert Redford's Ordinary People and Oliver Stone's JFK. More, recently, he starred in the Hunger Games films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, Made Up, But Still True, was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom - time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nLiam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland at the premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in LA on November 18, 2013. Photo / AP\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told the New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was The Dirty Dozen (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn Kelly's Heroes and M.A.S.H., an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told the Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland appears at the Oscars in Los Angeles on March 4, 2018. Photo / AP\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from M.A.S.H. He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors - even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's Fellini's Casanova), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's 1900), Claude Chabrol (1978's Blood Relatives) and John Schlesinger (1975's The Day of the Locust).\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's Klute (1971). It was during filming on Klute that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, Castle of the Living Dead.\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (Don't Look Now); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nDonald Sutherland and his son Kiefer Sutherland pose for a portrait in Los Angeles to promote the film Forsaken. Photo / AP\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's Ordinary People. Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film Citizen X and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in M.A.S.H. and Ordinary People), winning two -- again for Citizen X and for the 2003 TV film Path to War.\n\nOrdinary People also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire Gas and the 1984 comedy Crackers.\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's JFK (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie Six Degrees of Separation. He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's Without Limits.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Piece in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\"\n\nMore, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films and the HBO limited series \"The Undoing.\" He never retired and worked regularly up until his death.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me.

A life well lived,' Donald Sutherland's son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, writes on social media\n\nDonald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in movies such as \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Klute,\" \"Ordinary People\" and \"The Hunger Games,\" has died at the age of 88.\n\nThe actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, June 20, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.\n\nA tall man with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and a mischievous smile, Donald Sutherland switched effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nKiefer Sutherland said his father was \"never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\n\"He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards, including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005).\n\nIn the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nTributes to Sutherland came in across Hollywood and Canada on Thursday.\n\nRon Howard, who directed Sutherland in \"Backdraft,\" called him \"one of the most intelligent, interesting and engrossing film actors of all time.\"\n\nSutherland had \"incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence,\" Howard wrote on X.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Nova Scotia, said Sutherland \"was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft and truly, truly a great Canadian artist.\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Piece in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nPeople are also reading...

I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nHe received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nDonald Sutherland: A look at the award-winning actor's life and career, in photos 1971: Donald Sutherland, Jane Fonda 1971: Donald Sutherland, Jane Fonda 1977: Donald Sutherland, Haskell Wexler 1978: Donald Sutherland, Bette Midler 1978: Donald Sutherland, John Belushi 1995: Donald Sutherland wins Emmy for \"Citizen X\" 1996: Donald Sutherland wins Golden Globe for \"Citizen X\" 1999: Donald Sutherland 2000: Donald Sutherland 2005: Donald Sutherland 2005: Donald Sutherland 2008: Donald Sutherland 2008: Donald Sutherland, William Baldwin 2008: Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland 2009: Donald Sutherland in \"The Pillars of the Earth\" 2009: Donald Sutherland 2010: Donald Sutherland at Vancouver Olympics 2010: Donald Sutherland 2011: Donald Sutherland honored on Hollywood Walk of Fame 2012: Donald Sutherland 2012: Donald Sutherland at premiere of \"The Hunger Games\" 2014: Donald Sutherland 2014: Donald Sutherland 2015: Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland 2016: Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland 2016: Donald Sutherland 2017: Donald Sutherland, Helen Mirren 2017: Donald Sutherland 2017: Donald Sutherland receives honorary Oscar 2018: Donald Sutherland 2019: Donald Sutherland, Mick Jagger 2019: Donald Sutherland 2019: Donald Sutherland Photos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Piece in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\"\n\nMore, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films and the HBO limited series \"The Undoing.\" He never retired and worked regularly up until his death.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nHe received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He starred in more than 200 movies and TV shows.\n\nDonald Sutherland, the versatile Canadian actor whose prolific career in TV shows and movies showed a diverse range, from authority-loathing surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in the \"M*A*S*H\" movie to authoritarian villain President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise, has died. He was 88.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" his son Kiefer posted on social media Thursday along with a black and white photo of the father-son pair.\n\nHe added: \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to reps for Sutherland.\n\nStarring in more than 200 TV and movies, Sutherland beat an indelible and idiosyncratic path during his six-decade career. He was the pot-smoking professor in 1978's \"Animal House,\" the titular detective John Klute starring alongside then-lover Jane Fonda in the 1971 thriller \"Klute,\" a pod person in the 1978 horror remake \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" an 18th-century Venetian explorer in 1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\" with director Frederico Fellini, and an embattled father working to save his emotionally troubled upper-middle-class family in \"Ordinary People.\"\n\n\"I've always had a horizontally organized career,\" Sutherland told USA TODAY in 2018. \"You've got a big plate of fruit and cheese, and you can take a piece here and there. You won't like all of it, but you'll like some of it.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland interview: Playing 'cold' billionaire Getty, and a pint-size 'Hunger Games' fan's request\n\nAn Emmy winner and the patriarch of his own family of actors and entertainment professionals (including son Kiefer Sutherland, star of \"24\" and \"Designated Survivor\"), Sutherland is inarguably the greatest Hollywood actor never to earn a single Oscar nomination. He was most egregiously overlooked for his widely praised \"Ordinary People\" role, which saw screen wife Mary Tyler Moore earning one of six Oscar nominations -- and newcomer Timothy Hutton winning one of four Oscars playing Sutherland's screen son.\n\nJohn Bailey, the cinematographer on \"Ordinary People,\" helped to correct this wrong as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president in 2017, calling Sutherland personally to inform the actor that he would be awarded an honorary Oscar.\n\n\"Thank you for putting my name on this. This is very important to me, to my family,\" Sutherland said from the awards podium, looking at his Oscar. \"I wish I could say thank you to all the characters I have played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life.\"\n\nBorn to Dorothy and Frederick Sutherland in the seaport city of Saint John, New Brunswick, the young Sutherland found he was destined for character acting during an eye-opening discussion with his mother.\n\n\"I went to her and I said, 'Mother, am I good looking?' And my mother looked at me and went. 'Your face has character, Donald.' \" Sutherland recalled to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nAfter studying drama and starring in London stage and TV productions, Sutherland earned the one-line part on \"The Dirty Dozen,\" portraying goofy felon Vernon Pinkey in an all-star cast that included Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas. But when Clint Walker declined to do a scene where his character impersonates a general, director Robert Aldrich looked at Sutherland.\n\n\"He went, 'You with the big ears, you do it.' I don't think he knew my name. But, you know. It changed my life,' \" Sutherland told 60 Minutes in 2018.\n\nSutherland shot into stardom brandishing his own brand of quirky Vietnam War-era contempt in war movie portrayals, starting as convict soldier Vernon Pinkley in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) and the comical tank driver Sgt. Oddball in the 1970s World War II heist comedy \"Kelly's Heroes.\" He ended the streak as the wise-cracking surgeon in Robert Altman's 1970 Korean War comedy-drama \"M*A*S*H\" (Alan Alda portrayed Hawkeye Pierce in the seminal 1970s TV series).\n\nDuring his starring role as the enigmatic private detective in the neo-noir hit \"Klute,\" (which earned Fonda a best actress Oscar) that Sutherland, still married to second wife (mother of twins Rachel and Kiefer), began his relationship with Fonda. The two hit the road in the 1971 anti-Vietnam War road show for GI's, the \"F.T.A.\" (\"Free the Army\"). But the relationship had crashed and burned by the end of the year.\n\n\"It broke my heart. I was eviscerated,\" Sutherland told The Guardian in 2008. \"It was a wonderful relationship right up the point we lived together.\"\n\nThe next year, Sutherland met and married actress Francine Racette, and remained married for the rest of his life, with three sons together: Roeg, Rossif, and Angus Sutherland.\n\nThe actor had a particular skill for playing villains, a spy in \"Eye of the Needle\" a sadistic warden in 1989's \"Lock Up\" a scheming software CEO in \"Disclosure\" opposite Michael Douglas and Demi Moore and the cruel Attila in Bernardo Bertolucci Italian epic \"1900.\"\n\nAfter turning 80, Sutherland took on the role of his most famous villain, President Snow in \"The Hunger Games,\" the arch-nemesis to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen for four box office record breaking films from 2012-2015.\n\n\"My agent sends me these things because I'm 80 and I still like to know what's going on,\" he told Britain's \"The Telegraph.\" \"I hadn't even heard of the books, but it became patently apparent to me that this was something. It was the first thing I'd read in years that could become a creative political stimulus for young people.\"\n\nSutherland found a new generation of fans eager to take pictures with him, describing one fan who approached him in an airport. \"As we're waiting for her mother to take the picture, the girl turned and whispered in my ear, 'Look mean.' \" Sutherland recalled with glee.\n\nFinally, accepting his Oscar, Sutherland look over his showbiz family, including Kiefer's \"Veep\" actress daughter, Sarah Sutherland, and dedicated the award to his wife. \"From whom everything has come, and to whom everything is owed.\"\n\nHe closed the speech quoting comedian Jack Benny when presented with an honor.\n\n\"He said, as I say to you now, I don't deserve this, But I have arthritis, and I don't deserve that either.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type":

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford. For a career launched by \"M.A.S.H.\" it was a fitting, if ironic bookend.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_coyle@register-herald.com", "name": "Jake Coyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Character actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People_(John_Legend_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordinary People (John Legend song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Redford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hippie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1976 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Academy_of_Music_and_Dramatic_Art", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Gould", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Gould"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Fellini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Improvisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He starred in more than 200 movies and TV shows.\n\nDonald Sutherland, the versatile Canadian actor whose prolific career in TV shows and movies showed a diverse range, from authority-loathing surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in the \"M*A*S*H\" movie to authoritarian villain President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise, has died. He was 88.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" his son Kiefer posted on social media Thursday along with a black and white photo of the father-son pair.\n\nHe added: \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nStarring in more than 200 TV and movies, Sutherland beat an indelible and idiosyncratic path during his six-decade career. He was the pot-smoking professor in 1978's \"Animal House,\" the titular detective John Klute starring alongside then-lover Jane Fonda in the 1971 thriller \"Klute,\" a pod person in the 1978 horror remake \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" an 18th-century Venetian explorer in 1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\" with director Frederico Fellini, and an embattled father working to save his emotionally troubled upper-middle-class family in \"Ordinary People.\"\n\n\"I've always had a horizontally organized career,\" Sutherland told USA TODAY in 2018. \"You've got a big plate of fruit and cheese, and you can take a piece here and there. You won't like all of it, but you'll like some of it.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland interview: Playing 'cold' billionaire Getty, and a pint-size 'Hunger Games' fan's request\n\nAn Emmy winner and the patriarch of his own family of actors and entertainment professionals (including son Kiefer Sutherland, star of \"24\" and \"Designated Survivor\"), Sutherland is inarguably the greatest Hollywood actor never to earn a single Oscar nomination. He was most egregiously overlooked for his widely praised \"Ordinary People\" role, which saw screen wife Mary Tyler Moore earn one of six Oscar nominations -- and newcomer Timothy Hutton win one of four Oscars playing Sutherland's screen son.\n\nJohn Bailey, the cinematographer on \"Ordinary People,\" helped to correct this wrong as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president in 2017, calling Sutherland personally to inform the actor that he would be awarded an honorary Oscar.\n\n\"Thank you for putting my name on this. This is very important to me, to my family,\" Sutherland said from the 2017 Governors Awards podium, looking at his Oscar. \"I wish I could say thank you to all the characters I have played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life.\"\n\nBorn to Dorothy and Frederick Sutherland in the seaport city of Saint John, New Brunswick, the young Sutherland found he was destined for character acting during an eye-opening discussion with his mother.\n\n\"I went to her, and I said, 'Mother, am I good-looking?' And my mother looked at me and went. 'Your face has character, Donald.' \" Sutherland recalled to \"60 Minutes\" in 2018.\n\nAfter studying drama and starring in London stage and TV productions, Sutherland earned the one-line part on \"The Dirty Dozen,\" portraying goofy felon Vernon Pinkley in an all-star cast that included Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas. But when actor Clint Walker declined to do a scene where his character impersonates a general, director Robert Aldrich looked at Sutherland.\n\n\"He went, 'You with the big ears, you do it.' I don't think he knew my name. But, you know. It changed my life,' \" Sutherland told 60 Minutes.\n\nSutherland starred in 'The Dirty Dozen' and 'Kelly's Heroes'\n\nSutherland shot into stardom brandishing his own brand of quirky Vietnam War-era contempt in war movie portrayals, starting as convict soldier Vernon Pinkley in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) and the comical tank driver Sgt. Oddball in the 1970s World War II heist comedy \"Kelly's Heroes.\" He ended the streak as the wise-cracking surgeon in Robert Altman's 1970 Korean War comedy-drama \"M*A*S*H\" (Alan Alda portrayed Hawkeye Pierce in the seminal 1970s TV series).\n\nDuring his starring role as the enigmatic private detective in the neo-noir hit \"Klute\" (which earned Fonda a best actress Oscar), Sutherland, still married to his second wife Shirley Douglas (mother of twins Rachel and Kiefer), began his relationship with Fonda. The two hit the road in the 1971 anti-Vietnam War road show for GI's, the \"F.T.A.\" (\"Free the Army\"). But the relationship had crashed and burned by the end of the year.\n\n\"It broke my heart. I was eviscerated,\" Sutherland told The Guardian in 2008. \"It was a wonderful relationship right up to the point we lived together.\"\n\nThe next year, Sutherland met and married actress Francine Racette. He remained married for the rest of his life and had three sons together: Roeg, Rossif, and Angus Sutherland.\n\nSutherland played villain President Snow in 'Hunger Games'\n\nThe actor had a particular skill for playing villains, a spy in 1981's \"Eye of the Needle\" a sadistic warden in 1989's \"Lock Up\" a scheming software CEO in 1994's \"Disclosure\" opposite Michael Douglas and Demi Moore and the cruel Attila in Bernardo Bertolucci's Italian epic \"1900.\"\n\nAfter turning 80, Sutherland took on the role of his most famous villain, President Snow, in \"The Hunger Games\" -- the arch-nemesis to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen for four box office record-breaking films from 2012-2015.\n\n\"My agent sends me these things because I'm 80 and I still like to know what's going on,\" he told Britain's \"The Telegraph.\" \"I hadn't even heard of the books, but it became patently apparent to me that this was something. It was the first thing I'd read in years that could become a creative political stimulus for young people.\"\n\nSutherland found a new generation of fans eager to take pictures with him, describing one fan who approached him in an airport. \"As we're waiting for her mother to take the picture, the girl turned and whispered in my ear, 'Look mean.' \" Sutherland recalled with glee to USA Today in 2018.\n\nFinally, accepting his Oscar, Sutherland looked over his showbiz family, including Kiefer's \"Veep\" actress daughter, Sarah Sutherland, and dedicated the award to his wife Francine: \"From whom everything has come, and to whom everything is owed.\"\n\nHe closed the speech quoting comedian Jack Benny when presented with an honor.\n\n\"(Benny) said, as I say to you now, 'I don't deserve this, But I have arthritis, and I don't deserve that either,'\" said Sutherland.", "source": {"uri": "eu.montgomeryadvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Montgomery Advertiser"},

He was most egregiously overlooked for his widely praised \"Ordinary People\" role, which saw screen wife Mary Tyler Moore earning one of six Oscar nominations and newcomer Timothy Hutton winning one of four Oscars playing Sutherland's screen son.\n\nJohn Bailey, the cinematographer on \"Ordinary People,\" helped to correct this wrong as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president in 2017, calling Sutherland personally to inform the actor that he would be awarded an honorary Oscar.\n\n\"Thank you for putting my name on this. This is very important to me, to my family,\" Sutherland said from the awards podium, looking at his Oscar. \"I wish I could say thank you to all the characters I have played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life.\"\n\nBorn to Dorothy and Frederick Sutherland in the seaport city of Saint John, New Brunswick, to Dorothy and Frederick Sutherland, the young Sutherland found he was destined for character acting during an eye-opening discussion with his mother.\n\n\"I went to her and I said, 'Mother, am I good looking?' And my mother looked at me and went. 'Your face has character, Donald.' \" Sutherland recalled to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nAfter studying drama and starring in London stage and TV productions, Sutherland earned the one-line part on \"The Dirty Dozen,\" portraying goofy felon Vernon Pinkey in an all-star cast that included Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas. But when Clint Walker declined to do a scene where his character impersonates a general, director Robert Aldrich looked at Sutherland.\n\n\"He went, 'You with the big ears, you do it.' I don't think he knew my name. But, you know. It changed my life,' \" Sutherland told 60 Minutes in 2018.\n\nSutherland shot into stardom brandishing his own brand of quirky Vietnam War era contempt in war movie portrayals, starting with convict soldier Vernon Pinkley in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) and the comical tank driver Sgt. Oddball in 1970's World War II heist comedy \"Kelly's Heroes.\" He ended the streak as the wise-cracking surgeon in Robert Altman's 1970 Korean War comedy-drama \"M*A*S*H\" (Alan Alda portrayed Hawkeye Pierce in the seminal 1970s TV series).\n\nDuring his starring role as the enigmatic private detective in the neo-noir hit \"Klute,\" (which earned Fonda a best actress Oscar) that Sutherland, still married to second wife (mother of twins Rachel and Kiefer), began his relationship with Fonda. The two hit the road in the 1971 anti-Vietnam War road show for GI's, the \"F.T.A.\" (\"Free the Army\"). But the relationship had crashed and burned by the end of the year.\n\n\"It broke my heart. I was eviscerated,\" Sutherland told The Guardian in 2008. \"It was a wonderful relationship right up the point we lived together.\"\n\nThe next year, Sutherland met and married actress Francine Racette, and remained married for the rest of his life, with three sons together: Roeg, Rossif, and Angus Sutherland.\n\nThe actor had a particular skill for playing villains, a spy in \"Eye of the Needle\" a sadistic warden in 1989's \"Lock Up\" a scheming software CEO in \"Disclosure\" opposite Michael Douglas and Demi Moore and the cruel Attila in Bernardo Bertolucci Italian epic \"1900.\"\n\nAfter turning 80, Sutherland took on the role of his most famous villain, President Snow in \"The Hunger Games,\" the arch-nemesis to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen for four box office record breaking films from 2012-2015.\n\n\"My agent sends me these things because I'm 80 and I still like to know what's going on,\" he told Britain's \"The Telegraph.\" \"I hadn't even heard of the books, but it became patently apparent to me that this was something. It was the first thing I'd read in years that could become a creative political stimulus for young people.\"\n\nSutherland found a new generation of fans eager to take pictures with him, describing one fan who approached him in an airport. \"As we're waiting for her mother to take the picture, the girl turned and whispered in my ear, 'Look mean.' \" Sutherland recalled with glee.\n\nFinally, accepting his Oscar, Sutherland look over his showbiz family, including Kiefer's \"Veep\" actress daughter, Sarah Sutherland, and dedicated the award to his wife. \"From whom everything has come, and to whom everything is owed.\"\n\nHe closed the speech quoting comedian Jack Benny when presented with an honor.\n\n\"He said, as I say to you now, I don't deserve this, But I have arthritis, and I don't deserve that either.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 88.\n\nSon Kiefer Sutherland confirmed the death Thursday. No details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Sutherland, who flashed a grin that could be sweet or diabolical, was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s. He never stopped working, ultimately appearing in nearly 200 films and series.\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- roles in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" is due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at age 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959 but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to study acting. He began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis breakthrough was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopath. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" a smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He was unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations.\n\nSutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, he along with actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\n\"I thought I was going to be part of a revolution that was going to change movies and its influence on people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHis career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900''), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. He and Douglas divorced in 1971 after having twins: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nNicolas Roeg's psychological horror film \"Don't Look Now\" (1973) was another high point. Sutherland starred with Julie Christie as a grieving married couple who move to Venice after their daughter's death. The film included a famous, explicit sex scene, artfully edited.\n\n\"Nic and I thought that maybe I would die in the process of it, so much were we committed,\" Sutherland once said. His admiration for the film and Roeg was such that he and his next wife, actress Francine Racette, named their first-born child Roeg.\n\nSutherland married Racette in 1972 and remained with her the rest of his life. She survives him. They had two other children together: Rossif, named after the director Frederic Rossif; and Angus Redford, named after Redford.\n\nRobert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" (1980) also dealt with the loss of a child. His directorial debut, starring Sutherland as the father of a family destroyed by tragedy, won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was never nominated for an Oscar but received an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and won two Golden Globes for \"Citizen X\" and the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\nSutherland's New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances. A down period in the '80s followed, with failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily and increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's defense secretary, Clark Clifford.\n\nAfter son Kiefer emerged as a star, Sutherland appeared in numerous films with him, including the 1996 thriller \"A Time to Kill\" and 2015's \"Forsaken.\" But he turned down the chance to play the father on the hit series \"24.\"\n\nTo a younger generation, Sutherland was most familiar as President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise beginning with the 2012 original. Sutherland sought out the part.\n\n\"The role of the president had maybe a line in the script. Maybe two. Didn't make any difference,\" Sutherland told GQ. \"I thought it was an incredibly important film, and I wanted to be a part of it.\"\n\nIn his final years, the nonstop actor mused about dying onscreen, for real.\n\n\"I'm really hoping that in some movie I'm doing, I die -- but I die, me, Donald -- and they're able to use my funeral and the coffin,\" Sutherland told the AP. \"That would be absolutely ideal.

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991).

Known for roles in 'M*A*S*H,' 'Ordinary People,' and 'The Hunger Games,' his career spanned six decades. Tributes hail his incredible range and dedication, marking him as a true legend in the industry.\n\nDonald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in movies such as \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Klute,\" \"Ordinary People\" and \"The Hunger Games,\" has died at the age of 88. The actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.\n\nA tall man with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and a mischievous smile, Donald Sutherland switched effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains. One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels. \"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nKiefer Sutherland said his father was \"never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\" \"He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). He rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis. The following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings. Sutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards, including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005). In the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. \"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nTributes to Sutherland came in across Hollywood and Canada on Thursday. Ron Howard, who directed Sutherland in \"Backdraft,\" called him \"one of the most intelligent, interesting and engrossing film actors of all time.\"\n\nSutherland had \"incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence,\" Howard wrote on X. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Nova Scotia, said Sutherland \"was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft and truly, truly a great Canadian artist.\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Sutherland was 88 years old when he passed.\n\nBorn in Saint John, Canada, Sutherland barely survived a series of childhood diseases, including infantile paralysis, rheumatoid fever and spinal meningitis.\n\nHe chronicles those struggles in his memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" which is set to be released in November of this year. Sutherland also shared details about his burgeoning teenage sexuality and his love for acting. He began acting on screen in the early 1960s.\n\nSutherland broke through in Hollywood with a small role in the 1967 World War II classic \"The Dirty Dozen,\" and broke big with a starring role as Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.\"\n\nHe worked with auteurs including Nicolas Roeg in \"Don't Look Now\" and Federico Fellini in \"Fellini's Casanova.\" And he appeared just as often in more popular fare, playing a spacey tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes,\" a demented arsonist in \"Backdraft\" and an authoritarian president in the \"Hunger Games\" films.\n\nMore recently, Sutherland worked on the HBO limited series \"The Undoing.\" He never retired and worked regularly up until his death.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me.

He also played his share of oddballs and villains.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" , a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" , a small-town detective in \"Klute\" , a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" , a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" . He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" and its sequels.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nKiefer Sutherland said his father was \"never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\n\"He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" .\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" . The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards, including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" , \"Backdraft\" , \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" , \"Outbreak\" , \"A Time To Kill\" and \"Instinct\" and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" and \"Pride & Prejudice\" .\n\nIn the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nTributes to Sutherland came in across Hollywood and Canada on Thursday.\n\nRon Howard, who directed Sutherland in \"Backdraft,\" called him \"one of the most intelligent, interesting and engrossing film actors of all time.\"\n\nSutherland had \"incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence,\" Howard wrote on X.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Nova Scotia, said Sutherland \"was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft and truly, truly a great Canadian artist.\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Image: JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP / File\n\nDonald Sutherland, the prolific film and television actor whose long career stretched from \"M.A.S.H.\" to \"Fellini's Casanova\" to \"The Hunger Games,\" has died.\n\nHe was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death on Thursday.\n\nNo further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X.\n\n\"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomised the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down - but still eccentric - parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\"\n\nMore, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998.\n\n\"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom - time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher.\n\nRaised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981.\n\n\"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions.\n\nWhile studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress.\n\nThey married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting.\n\nSutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television.\n\nAfter a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic.\n\n1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970.\n\n\"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\"\n\nHe and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced.\n\nBut the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message.\n\nOutspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971.\n\nBanned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland's career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors - even if they didn't always do their best work with him.\n\nDonald Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas.\n\nHaving been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nHe did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two - again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991).\n\nHe again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Donald Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford.\n\nFor a career launched by \"M.A.S.H.\" it was a fitting, if ironic bookend.", "source": {"uri": "thesouthafrican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The South African"},

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\nKiefer Sutherland continued to write that his father \"loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nDecorated resume\n\nTall, distinctive and known for his intensity on screen, Sutherland earned an Emmy for his role as a Soviet official in the fact-based 1995 TV movie \"Citizen X,\" as well as a pair of Golden Globes. His career spanned more than 60 years and nearly 200 film and TV credits, including recent roles in the limited series \"Trust\" as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty and HBO's \"The Undoing.\"\n\nSutherland's big break came when he was cast as one of \"The Dirty Dozen\" in the star-studded 1967 film, which became a major hit. He followed that with another war movie, \"Kelly's Heroes,\" before playing the wisecracking doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the movie version of \"M*A*S*H\" and opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a high-class \"call girl\" in the crime mystery \"Klute.\" (Fonda and Sutherland also had an off-screen relationship around the time that they made the film.)\n\nReflecting his ability to play all sorts of roles, Sutherland's 1970s resume included a chillingly effective remake of the horror film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and a memorable turn as a pot-smoking professor in the National Lampoon comedy \"Animal House.\"\n\nHe also starred opposite Julie Christie in director Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a 1973 movie that became somewhat notorious for the raciness of its sex scene, which had to be trimmed in order to avoid an X rating.\n\nA steady stream of roles followed in a wide variety of genres, from a small but pivotal part in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" to supporting work in \"Ordinary People\" (which won the Oscar for best picture), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Backdraft\" and \"The Italian Job.\"\n\nSutherland also starred as the legendary lover for director Federico Fellini in \"Fellini's Casanova.\" Many younger filmgoers, meanwhile, will likely remember him as the evil president in \"The Hunger Games\" movies.\n\nBeginnings\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland endured several bouts of ill health as a child, including polio. He attended the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering before gravitating toward drama and appearing on stage, graduating with degrees in both.\n\nThe 6'4\" actor met his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in college, and the two married in 1959. He moved to London, where he found some stage work, and eventually to Hollywood in the 1960s, where \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"M*A*S*H\" put him on the map.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he divorced, marrying actress Shirley Douglas, whom he met while filming the horror movie \"Castle of the Living Dead.\" They had two children, actor Kiefer and Rachel, who also works in film as a post-production supervisor. That marriage also ended in divorce, and in 1972 Sutherland wed his third wife, actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons.\n\nIn a 2020 conversation with \"The Undoing\" costar Hugh Grant for Interview magazine, Sutherland said that he was always so nervous when a movie began shooting that he threw up the night before. He also discussed subtly altering his dialogue, as he put it, to \"try to make the lines that I've been given fit my mouth.\"\n\nSutherland appeared in three films with son Kiefer, beginning with the \"24\" star's small part in the comedy-drama \"Max Dugan Returns\" in 1983, followed by the John Grisham adaptation \"A Time to Kill.\" The two didn't perform in a scene together, however, until the 2016 western \"Forsaken.\"\n\n\"It was a memory and an experience that I will treasure for the rest of my life,\" Kiefer Sutherland told \"Good Morning America\" at the time, saying he spent years looking for something that the two could do together.\n\nAsked what advice he would give young actors, Sutherland told Reuters in 2019, \"Try and be as truthful as you possibly can, read, read a lot, learn, memorize things, enjoy your artistry, study dancing, be a circus performer, learn how to juggle, so many things, but mostly you have to observe.\"\n\nSutherland received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board in 2017 and was honored with the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 2022, Sutherland appeared alongside Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson in the space thriller \"Moonfall\" and in the Roku TV mini series \"Swimming with Sharks.\" His final credit came in 2023, with the actor starring in the Paramount+ western drama \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\"\n\nCNN", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Undoing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Getty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down - but still eccentric - parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\nFILE - Actor Donald Sutherland appears at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Oct. 13, 2017. Sutherland, the towering Canadian actor whose career spanned \"M.A.S.H.\" to \"The Hunger Games,\" has died at 88. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File)\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom - time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director\u00b4s unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone\u00b4s expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors - even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two - again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford. For a career launched by \"M.A.S.H.\" it was a fitting, if ironic bookend.\n\nFILE - Actor Donald Sutherland appears at the premiere of the film \"The Burnt Orange Heresy\" at the 76th edition of the Venice Film Festival, Venice, Italy, on Sept. 7, 2019.

He was 88.\n\nFor over a half century, Sutherland memorably played villains, antiheroes, romantic leads and mentor figures. His profile had recently increased with his supporting role as the evil President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.\n\nSutherland won a supporting actor Emmy for HBO's \"Citizen X\" in 1995 and was also nominated in 2006 for the Lifetime miniseries \"Human Trafficking.\"\n\nAfter what Sutherland called \"a meandering little career,\" including roles in low-budget horror pics like 1963's \"Castle of the Living Dead\" and 1965's \"Die! Die! My Darling!,\" he landed a part as one of the bottom six in 1967's \"The Dirty Dozen.\"\n\nSutherland told the Guardian in 2005 that he originally had one line in the film, until Clint Walker refused to play a scene requiring him to impersonate a general. According to Sutherland, director Robert Aldrich, who didn't know his name, suddenly turned to him and said, \"You! With the big ears! You do it!\"\n\nThe smart-alecky role was a perfect fit for Sutherland, whose wolfish sideways smile and boyish charm caught the attention of producer Ingo Preminger, who cast him as the anti-authoritarian surgeon Capt. \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in 1970's comedy smash hit \"MASH.\"\n\n\"MASH\" turned Sutherland, and co-star Elliott Gould, who played Capt. \"Trapper\" John, into major stars. But the tradition-bound actors had trouble adjusting to director Robert Altman's improvisational and often chaotic approach. According to Sutherland, Altman tried to fire him during the shoot, but Preminger held firm.\n\nIn a 1976 Playboy interview, Altman gave a different view, recalling that Sutherland loved his directorial style. \"His improvisation was profound,\" Altman said. \"He's a hell of an actor.\"\n\nSutherland also co-starred with Gould in 1971's inspired Alan Arkin-helmed black comedy \"Little Murders\" and again in director Irvin Kershner's 1974 misfire \"SPYS.\"\n\nIn the 1970 WWII actioner \"Kelly's Heroes,\" Sutherland joined Clint Eastwood, portraying Sgt. Oddball, an absurdly conceived but scene-stealing proto-hippie tank commander. (Sutherland reteamed with Eastwood in 2000's \"Space Cowboys,\" this time playing a former hotshot pilot.)\n\nWith 1971's \"Klute,\" a thriller/character study directed by Alan J. Pakula and co-starring Jane Fonda, Sutherland emerged as a credible romantic leading man. He portrayed a troubled detective who falls in love with a call girl (Fonda) whom he's protecting from a sadistic killer.\n\nFonda later gave Sutherland credit for her Oscar-winning best actress performance, because of \"all the intense feelings I was experiencing\" with him.\n\nThe two were having a love affair at the time, and the relationship stoked Sutherland's antiwar politics. He got involved with Vietnam Veterans Against the War and, along with Peter Boyle and Howard Hesseman, Fonda and Sutherland put together a traveling revue called FTA (Free the Army, popularly known as F*@k the Army). The Pentagon unsuccessfully tried to keep troops away from the shows; the FBI put both Sutherland and Fonda under surveillance.\n\nIn Nicholas Roeg's influential 1973 psychological horror film \"Don't Look Now,\" Sutherland's intriguing passivity and pared-down acting style helped highlight Julie Christie's performance. They portray a grieving married couple who flee England to Venice after the death of their little girl.\n\nThe film became controversial for an integral explicit sex scene between them, edited in a fragmented style. Roeg intercut their post-coital dressing to go out to dinner as the sequence unfolds. Even in a sex-obsessed era, the scene became -- and remains -- one of the most memorable ever filmed.\n\nAt the height of his success, Sutherland began to make eccentric career choices. He turned down John Boorman for \"Deliverance\" and chose Paul Mazursky's flat \"Alex in Wonderland\" (1970) over Peckinpah's \"Straw Dogs.\" He acted with Fonda again in \"Steelyard Blues\" (1973) and played Christ in Dalton Trumbo's \"Johnny Got His Gun\" (1971). Both fizzled at the box office.\n\nSutherland received mixed notices for his role as a hick in John Schlesinger's \"Day of the Locust\" (1975), played the title character in 1976's arty bomb \"Fellini's Casanova\" and a psychopathic fascist in Bertolucci's \"1900\" (1977). He had a memorable cameo in 1978 hit \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" playing a professor who is discovered having an affair with a student (Karen Allen). He took a small upfront fee for his work instead of an offered percentage of the profits. The actor estimated the choice cost him $14 million.\n\nSutherland rebounded with 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" convincing director Robert Redford to cast him as the grieving father trying to hold his family together after his older son's accidental death. Redford had originally offered him the part of the psychiatrist that eventually went to Judd Hirsch.\n\nIn 1981 WWII thriller \"Eye of the Needle,\" Sutherland gave one of his last romantic leading man performances on the bigscreen, albeit as a heavy -- a stranded German agent who falls for a lonely married woman (Kate Nelligan).\n\nAnother career peak came in 1998, when Sutherland convinced director-writer Robert Towne to cast him as coach and Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman in \"Without Limits,\" about U. of Oregon runner Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup). He was also memorable in 2005's \"Pride and Prejudice\" as Keira Knightley's father.\n\nSutherland made a lasting impression in smaller roles, such as Mister X, a high-placed Pentagon official who claims to know why JFK was murdered, in 1991's Oliver Stone-helmed \"JFK.\"\n\nRemarkably, Sutherland was never nominated for an Oscar, though his work in such films as \"Ordinary People\" and \"Without Limits\" is often cited by critics as among the finest of their respective decades.\n\nOther noteworthy roles include President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels; a safecracker in \"The Italian Job\" (2003); the father in \"Six Degrees of Separation\" (1993); a stylish safecracker in \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1978); and the lead in Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\nSutherland also appeared with son Kiefer in 1996's \"A Time to Kill.\" He turned down an offer to play the father of Kiefer's character, Jack Bauer, in \"24,\" his son's successful TV series. The two appeared together in the 2014 Western \"Forsaken.\"\n\nIn 2014 the actor also starred with Brie Larson in the India-set musical comedy \"Basmati Blues,\" written and directed by Dan Baron.\n\nSutherland's TV work includes \"The Superlative Seven\" episode of \"The Avengers\" (1967) and two episodes of \"The Saint\" (1965, 1966). He starred as Patrick \"Tripp\" Darling III in \"Dirty Sexy Money\" (2007-09) and as Nathan Templeton in \"Commander in Chief\" (2005-06). His TV miniseries work includes 2010's \"The Pillars of the Earth,\" based on Ken Follett's epic novel.\n\nIn one of his best TV roles, Sutherland portrayed Clark Clifford in John Frankenheimer's \"Path to War\" (2002). In 1995, he won a supporting actor Emmy for \"Citizen X\" (HBO).\n\nHe was a series regular in Ed Bernero's European crime series \"Crossing Lines.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Gould", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Gould"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Improvisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

No details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Sutherland, who flashed a grin that could be sweet or diabolical, was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s. He never stopped working, ultimately appearing in nearly 200 films and series.\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- roles in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" is due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at age 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959 but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to study acting. He began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis breakthrough was \"The Dirty Dozen\" , in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopath. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" a smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He was unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations.\n\nSutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, he along with actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\n\"I thought I was going to be part of a revolution that was going to change movies and its influence on people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHis career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini , Bernardo Bertolucci , Claude Chabrol and John Schlesinger .\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" . It was during filming that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. He and Douglas divorced in 1971 after having twins: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nNicolas Roeg's psychological horror film \"Don't Look Now\" was another high point. Sutherland starred with Julie Christie as a grieving married couple who move to Venice after their daughter's death. The film included a famous, explicit sex scene, artfully edited.\n\n\"Nic and I thought that maybe I would die in the process of it, so much were we committed,\" Sutherland once said. His admiration for the film and Roeg was such that he and his next wife, actress Francine Racette, named their first-born child Roeg.\n\nSutherland married Racette in 1972 and remained with her the rest of his life. She survives him. They had two other children together: Rossif, named after the director Frederic Rossif; and Angus Redford, named after Redford.\n\nRobert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" also dealt with the loss of a child. His directorial debut, starring Sutherland as the father of a family destroyed by tragedy, won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was never nominated for an Oscar but received an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and won two Golden Globes for \"Citizen X\" and the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\nSutherland's New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances. A down period in the '80s followed, with failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily.

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991).

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\nKiefer Sutherland continued to write that his father \"loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nDecorated resume\n\nTall, distinctive and known for his intensity on screen, Sutherland earned an Emmy for his role as a Soviet official in the fact-based 1995 TV movie \"Citizen X,\" as well as a pair of Golden Globes. His career spanned more than 60 years and nearly 200 film and TV credits, including recent roles in the limited series \"Trust\" as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty and HBO's \"The Undoing.\"\n\nSutherland's big break came when he was cast as one of \"The Dirty Dozen\" in the star-studded 1967 film, which became a major hit. He followed that with another war movie, \"Kelly's Heroes,\" before playing the wisecracking doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the movie version of \"M*A*S*H\" and opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a high-class \"call girl\" in the crime mystery \"Klute.\" (Fonda and Sutherland also had an off-screen relationship around the time that they made the film.)\n\nReflecting his ability to play all sorts of roles, Sutherland's 1970s resume included a chillingly effective remake of the horror film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and a memorable turn as a pot-smoking professor in the National Lampoon comedy \"Animal House.\"\n\nHe also starred opposite Julie Christie in director Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a 1973 movie that became somewhat notorious for the raciness of its sex scene, which had to be trimmed in order to avoid an X rating.\n\nA steady stream of roles followed in a wide variety of genres, from a small but pivotal part in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" to supporting work in \"Ordinary People\" (which won the Oscar for best picture), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Backdraft\" and \"The Italian Job.\"\n\nSutherland also starred as the legendary lover for director Federico Fellini in \"Fellini's Casanova.\" Many younger filmgoers, meanwhile, will likely remember him as the evil president in \"The Hunger Games\" movies.\n\nBeginnings\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland endured several bouts of ill health as a child, including polio. He attended the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering before gravitating toward drama and appearing on stage, graduating with degrees in both.\n\nThe 6'4\" actor met his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in college, and the two married in 1959. He moved to London, where he found some stage work, and eventually to Hollywood in the 1960s, where \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"M*A*S*H\" put him on the map.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he divorced, marrying actress Shirley Douglas, whom he met while filming the horror movie \"Castle of the Living Dead.\" They had two children, actor Kiefer and Rachel, who also works in film as a post-production supervisor. That marriage also ended in divorce, and in 1972 Sutherland wed his third wife, actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons.\n\nIn a 2020 conversation with \"The Undoing\" costar Hugh Grant for Interview magazine, Sutherland said that he was always so nervous when a movie began shooting that he threw up the night before. He also discussed subtly altering his dialogue, as he put it, to \"try to make the lines that I've been given fit my mouth.\"\n\nFamily connections\n\nSutherland appeared in three films with son Kiefer, beginning with the \"24\" star's small part in the comedy-drama \"Max Dugan Returns\" in 1983, followed by the John Grisham adaptation \"A Time to Kill.\" The two didn't perform in a scene together, however, until the 2016 western \"Forsaken.\"\n\n\"It was a memory and an experience that I will treasure for the rest of my life,\" Kiefer Sutherland told \"Good Morning America\" at the time, saying he spent years looking for something that the two could do together.\n\nAsked what advice he would give young actors, Sutherland told Reuters in 2019, \"Try and be as truthful as you possibly can, read, read a lot, learn, memorize things, enjoy your artistry, study dancing, be a circus performer, learn how to juggle, so many things, but mostly you have to observe.\"\n\nSutherland received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board in 2017 and was honored with the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 2022, Sutherland appeared alongside Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson in the space thriller \"Moonfall\" and in the Roku TV mini series \"Swimming with Sharks.\" His final credit came in 2023, with the actor starring in the Paramount+ western drama \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

He followed that with another war movie, \"Kelly's Heroes,\" before playing the wisecracking doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the movie version of \"M*A*S*H\" and opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a high-class \"call girl\" in the crime mystery \"Klute.\" (Fonda and Sutherland also had an off-screen relationship around the time that they made the film.)\n\nReflecting his ability to play all sorts of roles, Sutherland's 1970s resume included a remake of the horror film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and a memorable turn as a pot-smoking professor in the National Lampoon comedy \"Animal House.\"\n\nHe also starred opposite Julie Christie in director Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a 1973 movie that became somewhat notorious for the raciness of its sex scene, which had to be trimmed in order to avoid an X rating.\n\nA steady stream of roles followed in a wide variety of genres, from a small but pivotal part in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" to supporting work in \"Ordinary People\" (which won the Oscar for best picture), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Backdraft\" and \"The Italian Job.\"\n\nSutherland also starred as the legendary lover for director Federico Fellini in \"Fellini's Casanova.\" Many younger filmgoers, meanwhile, will likely remember him as the evil president in \"The Hunger Games\" movies.\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland endured several bouts of ill health as a child, including polio. He attended the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering before gravitating toward drama and appearing on stage, graduating with degrees in both.\n\nThe 6'4\" actor met his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in college, and the two married in 1959. He moved to London, where he found some stage work, and eventually to Hollywood in the 1960s, where \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"M*A*S*H\" put him on the map.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he divorced, marrying actress Shirley Douglas, whom he met while filming the horror movie \"Castle of the Living Dead.\" They had two children, Kiefer and Rachel, who also works in film as a post-production supervisor. That also ended in divorce, and in 1972 Sutherland wed his third wife, actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons.\n\nIn a 2020 conversation with \"The Undoing\" co-star Hugh Grant for Interview magazine, Sutherland said that he was always so nervous when a movie began shooting that he threw up the night before. He also discussed subtly altering his dialogue, as he put it, to \"try to make the lines that I've been given fit my mouth.\"\n\nSutherland appeared in three films with son Kiefer, beginning with the \"24\" star's small part in the comedy-drama \"Max Dugan Returns\" in 1983, followed by the John Grisham adaptation \"A Time to Kill.\" The two didn't perform in a scene together, however, until the 2016 western \"Forsaken.\"\n\n\"It was a memory and an experience that I will treasure for the rest of my life,\" Kiefer Sutherland told \"Good Morning America\" at the time, saying he spent years looking for something that the two could do together.\n\nAsked what advice he would give young actors, Sutherland told Reuters in 2019, \"Try and be as truthful as you possibly can, read, read a lot, learn, memorize things, enjoy your artistry, study dancing, be a circus performer, learn how to juggle, so many things, but mostly you have to observe.\"\n\nSutherland received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board in 2017 and was honored with the Order of Canada.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television.\n\nAfter a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory. His first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic.\n\n1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\"\n\nThere is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\" If Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\"\n\nHe and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced.\n\nBut the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971.\n\nBanned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him.\n\nSutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").One of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971).\n\nIt was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\n\n\"In 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture. Sutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career.\n\nHe was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\" But Sutherland continued to work steadily.\n\nHe had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\"\n\nHe played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits. \"In the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\nKiefer Sutherland continued to write that his father \"loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nTall and known for his intensity on screen, Sutherland earned an Emmy for his role as a Soviet official in the fact-based HBO movie \"Citizen X,\" as well as a pair of Golden Globes. His career spanned more than 50 years and 140 film credits, including recent roles in the limited series \"Trust\" as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty and HBO's \"The Undoing.\"\n\nSutherland's big break came when he was cast as one of \"The Dirty Dozen\" in the star-studded 1967 film, which became a major hit. He followed that with another war movie, \"Kelly's Heroes,\" before playing the wisecracking doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the movie version of \"M*A*S*H\" and opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a high-class \"call girl\" in the crime mystery \"Klute.\" (Fonda and Sutherland also had an off-screen relationship around the time that they made the film.)\n\nReflecting his ability to play all sorts of roles, Sutherland's 1970s resume included a remake of the horror film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and a memorable turn as a pot-smoking professor in the National Lampoon comedy \"Animal House.\"\n\nHe also starred opposite Julie Christie in director Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a 1973 movie that became somewhat notorious for the raciness of its sex scene, which had to be trimmed in order to avoid an X rating.\n\nA steady stream of roles followed in a wide variety of genres, from a small but pivotal part in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" to supporting work in \"Ordinary People\" (which won the Oscar for best picture), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Backdraft\" and \"The Italian Job.\"\n\nSutherland also starred as the legendary lover for director Federico Fellini in \"Fellini's Casanova.\" Many younger filmgoers, meanwhile, will likely remember him as the evil president in \"The Hunger Games\" movies.\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland endured several bouts of ill health as a child, including polio. He attended the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering before gravitating toward drama and appearing on stage, graduating with degrees in both.\n\nThe 6'4\" actor met his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in college, and the two married in 1959. He moved to London, where he found some stage work, and eventually to Hollywood in the 1960s, where \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"M*A*S*H\" put him on the map.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he divorced, marrying actress Shirley Douglas, whom he met while filming the horror movie \"Castle of the Living Dead.\" They had two children, Kiefer and Rachel, who also works in film as a post-production supervisor. That also ended in divorce, and in 1972 Sutherland wed his third wife, actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons.\n\nIn a 2020 conversation with \"The Undoing\" co-star Hugh Grant for Interview magazine, Sutherland said that he was always so nervous when a movie began shooting that he threw up the night before. He also discussed subtly altering his dialogue, as he put it, to \"try to make the lines that I've been given fit my mouth.\"\n\nSutherland appeared in three films with son Kiefer, beginning with the \"24\" star's small part in the comedy-drama \"Max Dugan Returns\" in 1983, followed by the John Grisham adaptation \"A Time to Kill.\" The two didn't perform in a scene together, however, until the 2016 western \"Forsaken.\"\n\n\"It was a memory and an experience that I will treasure for the rest of my life,\" Kiefer Sutherland told \"Good Morning America\" at the time, saying he spent years looking for something that the two could do together.\n\nAsked what advice he would give young actors, Sutherland told Reuters in 2019, \"Try and be as truthful as you possibly can, read, read a lot, learn, memorize things, enjoy your artistry, study dancing, be a circus performer, learn how to juggle, so many things, but mostly you have to observe.\"\n\nSutherland received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board in 2017 and was honored with the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 2022,\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nHe received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He did, however, receive an honorary Oscar in 2017, as well as two BAFTA nominations, an Emmy Award and two Golden Globes.\n\nHe was also an officer of the Order of Canada and won a Genie and a Governor General's Performing Arts Award.\n\nAs Sutherland worked around the world, he maintained a home in Quebec's Eastern Townships, where he would host dinner parties for his famous family and celebrity friends.\n\n\"I love this country,\" Sutherland said when he received the Governor General's Award in 2000.\n\n\"You know, (W.H.) Auden, the English poet, said that a poet's hope is to be like some valley cheese: local, but prized elsewhere.

(Domenico Stinellis / AP Photo)\n\nSutherland was born in Saint John and raised in Bridgewater, N.S. His father, Frederick Sutherland, was a salesman and his mother, Dorothy Isobel, a mathematics teacher. Various reports say Sutherland battled polio, rheumatic fever and hepatitis as a child.\n\nAt age 14, Sutherland landed a part-time job as a DJ and news broadcaster for local radio station CKBW. It was the start of a successful side career in multimedia voice-over work -- something son Kiefer also pursued.\n\nSutherland studied drama, engineering and English at the University of Toronto, where he played to audiences at the Hart House Theatre and met his first wife of seven years, Lois Hardwick. His memories of toga parties at U of T's Gate House residence were said to be the inspiration for the 1978 film \"Animal House,\" in which he co-starred.\n\nAfter getting his degree in 1958, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in England and went on to act with the Perth Repertory Theatre in Scotland and on London's West End.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he transitioned into features, including the thrillers \"Castle of the Living Dead,\" \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" and \"Die! Die! My Darling!\" He also landed small roles on TV series including \"Court Martial,\" \"The Saint\" and \"The Avengers.\"\n\nIn 1966, Sutherland married his second wife, Canadian actress and activist Shirley Douglas, daughter of medicare founder Tommy Douglas. That same year they had twins Rachel and Kiefer, who has become a star in his own right with films including \"The Lost Boys\" and the TV series \"24.\"\n\nWhen Sutherland saw that his son wanted to follow in his footsteps, he gave him one important piece of advice:\n\n\"I don't care what you do with your life,\" Kiefer Sutherland, quoting his dad, said in a 1998 interview with The Canadian Press.\n\n\"Just don't lie in your work, because they'll catch you.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland's breakthrough in the U.S. came in 1967 with the film \"The Dirty Dozen,\" in which he played an imprisoned soldier during the Second World War. Co-stars included Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson.\n\nThree years later, he further solidified his star status in Hollywood with two more war films: Robert Altman's Oscar-winning Korean War satire \"MASH,\" and \"Kelly's Heroes,\" alongside Clint Eastwood and Telly Savalas.\n\nJury member Donald Sutherland talks on arrival for the screening of the film Cafe Society and the Opening Ceremony at the 69th international film festival, Cannes, southern France, Wednesday, May 11, 2016.

Later, Sutherland married French-Canadian actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons: Roeg, Angus and Rossif, star of \"Poor Boy's Game\" and \"High Life.\"\n\nIn the '80s, Sutherland continued to build his resume at a feverish pace, with turns in nearly 20 films including Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People,\" for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe, and \"Threshold,\" which earned him a Genie.\n\nSutherland eventually won two Golden Globes: in 1996 for his supporting role in \"Citizen X,\" for which he also earned an Emmy, then in 2003 for the HBO film \"Path to War.\" That same year he played a minister in \"Cold Mountain.\"\n\nHe also got to work with his actor-sons, sharing the screen with Kiefer in the films \"Max Dugan Returns\" and \"A Time to Kill,\" and with Rossif in \"The Steal Artist.\"\n\nRossif Sutherland said working with his dad was \"a dream.\"\n\n\"He's been the reason for which I've started a road in this career and he likes to call himself my first fan,\" he told The Canadian Press in January 2010.\n\n\"He's the one person that I've worked with that gives the impression that I can do no wrong.\"\n\nFor actor Peter Krause, working with Sutherland on \"Dirty, Sexy, Money\" was \"a real trip.\"\n\n\"He's a total character,\" Krause said in a May 2007 interview with The Canadian Press. \"A really interesting guy.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General's_Performing_Arts_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor General's Performing Arts Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander in Chief (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Townships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Townships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baritone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Sutherland did not immediately respond to Entertainment Weekly's request for comment.\n\nSutherland was also remembered by his former costar, Helen Mirren, who starred opposite him in the 2017 comedy, The Leisure Seeker.\n\n\"Donald Sutherland was one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain, and a great knowledge on a wide variety of subjects,\" Mirren said in a statement shared with EW. \"He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became.\"\n\nShe added, \"He was my colleague and became my friend. I will miss his presence in this world.\"\n\nWant more movie news?

In college, Sutherland double majored in engineering and drama before fully embracing his interest in acting. He left Canada for Britain in 1957 to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nSutherland began his career with unnamed roles in British television before landing small parts in low-budget horror films, including 1964's Castle of the Living Dead and 1965's Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. His breakout role was in Robert Aldritch's The Dirty Dozen, where he starred alongside Lee Marvin, John Cassavetes, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Clint Walker and more. Sutherland told The Guardian in 2005 that he originally had a single line in the movie -- \"Number two, sir!\" -- until Walker refused to participate in a scene that required him to impersonate a general.\n\n\"The director Robert Aldrich, who had a huge authoritarian streak, turned to me -- we'd all had our heads shaved -- and said, 'You! With the big ears! You do it!,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"He didn't even know my name!\"\n\nSutherland achieved further success as Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's 1970 war comedy, M*A*S*H. The film marked a Hollywood breakthrough for both Sutherland and his co-star, Elliott Gould.\n\nSutherland went on to star in such acclaimed films as Klute, Don't Look Now, Fellini's Casanova, Animal House, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Ordinary People, JFK, Six Degrees of Separation, The Italian Job and Pride & Prejudice. In recent years, he played the Hunger Games franchise antagonist President Coriolanus Snow, who torments Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen across the franchise's original four films.\n\nWhile Sutherland was never nominated for a competitive Oscar, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored him with an honorary statuette at the 2017 Governors Awards. Sutherland earned both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role in the detective drama, Citizen X, and an additional Golden Globe for the HBO series, Path to War.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [],

He was 88.\n\nSutherland died Thursday in Miami after a long illness, CAA's Missy Davy told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRemarkably, Sutherland was never even nominated for a competitive Oscar, though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made up for the oversight by giving him an honorary statuette in November 2017 at the Governors Awards.\n\nA prodigious actor who often appeared in three to five films a year, the lanky Canadian-born star displayed great range during his six-decade career. His early characters, like crazed/dazed Pvt. Vernon Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen (1967), anti-Establishment Army medic Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in M*A*S*H (1970) and hippie tank commander Oddball in Kelly's Heroes (1970), were rascally mavericks.\n\nWith his distinctive baritone and crystal blue eyes, Sutherland was also effective in provocative roles, like when he played a private eye who falls for a prostitute (his then real-life romantic partner Jane Fonda) in Alan J. Pakula's Klute (1971).\n\nIn Nicolas Roeg's horror thriller Don't Look Now (1973), he and Julie Christie tantalized audiences in one particular bedroom scene, one of the more torrid sexual sequences in movie history. And for Federico Fellini, he starred in 1976 as Casanova.\n\nSurvivors include his four sons, actors Kiefer Sutherland, Rossif Sutherland and Angus Sutherland and CAA executive Roeg Sutherland; a granddaughter, Sarah Sutherland, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' daughter on Veep; and his partner/wife since 1972, actress Francine Racette.\n\nSutherland's turn as the irreverent, martini-loving Hawkeye in M*A*S*H opposite Elliott Gould as \"Trapper\" John McIntyre brought him international stardom at age 35.\n\n\"It showed the concept of war without showing war,\" he said of the classic Robert Altman film in a 1970 interview for the CBC program Telescope. \"When you are in a field station like we were, it is insane to watch human bodies come flying into a camp that are wrecked for no reason at all. That kind of insanity created an environment, a kind of mini-society, that was in chaos. To a lot of people, that represents a kind of society that we have today.\"\n\nTaking a different tack, Sutherland was empathetic as a suburban Chicago lawyer trying to hold his family together in Robert Redford's Ordinary People (1980) and as a compassionate doctor in Richard Pearce's Threshold (1981). But then there he was playing a maniacal pyromaniac in Ron Howard's Backdraft (1991).\n\nSutherland said he pursued the part of the despotic President Snow in The Hunger Games (2012) after his agent sent him the script. (He would return for all three sequels.)\n\n\"I wasn't offered it,\" he told GQ in a 2014 interview. \"I like to read scripts, and it captured my passion. I wrote them a letter. The role of the president had maybe a line in the script. Maybe two. Didn't make any difference. I thought it was an incredibly important film, and I wanted to be a part of it. I thought it could wake up an electorate that had been dormant since the '70s.\n\n\"I hadn't read the books. To be truthful, I was unaware of them. But they showed my letter to the director, Gary Ross, and he thought it'd be a good idea if I did it. He wrote those wonderfully poetic scenes in the rose garden, and they formed the mind and wit of Coriolanus Snow.\"\n\nThe nimble Sutherland also memorably played a man on the run in Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a pot-smoking professor in Animal House (1978), the French painter Paul Gauguin in The Wolf at the Door (1986) and a South African schoolteacher who changes his opinion about apartheid in A Dry White Season (1989).\n\nAsked by Anderson Cooper in a 2017 profile for 60 Minutes about finding inspiration in a role, Sutherland responded: \"I don't find it. It finds me. I mean, I will read it. And suddenly, it starts churning around inside me. And, then, it gets violent. And, then, it gets loving. And it's an extraordinary thing. It gets more and more and more exciting. It's delicious.\"\n\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick. He had polio when he was very young and then missed the fourth grade when he had to stay home with rheumatic fever. His father, Frederick, was a salesman and his mother, Dorothy, a mathematics teacher.\n\nWhen he was 12, the family moved to Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, and he attended Bridgewater High School and then the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering and drama before graduating in 1958.\n\nAfter working in regional theater in Ontario, he attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art but dropped out after a year, then spent five years practicing his craft in English and Scottish repertory theaters.\n\n\"My first offer ever for a film was in 1962,\" he told GQ in a tale he related often. \"I auditioned for the producer, the writer, the director. And I came home and said to my first wife, 'I thought it went OK.' You never want to say you did well before you know anything.\n\n\"The next morning they were all on the phone saying how wonderful the audition had been. And then the producer said, 'We loved you so much, we wanted to explain why we weren't casting you. We've always thought of this as a guy-next-door sort of character, and we don't think you look like you've ever lived next door to anybody.\"\n\nHe said he was self-conscious about his looks. When he asked his mom if he were handsome, she replied, \"Your face has character.\"\n\nWhile in the play Spoon River Anthology, Sutherland was approached by producer Paul Maslansky about performing in The Castle of the Living Dead (1964), a low-budget horror film being shot in Italy. He played a soldier, a witch and an old man in that.\n\nHe then portrayed a lunatic in Hammer Films' Die! Die! My Darling (1965), starring Tallulah Bankhead; showed up on British TV on The Saint and The Avengers; and spoke as a mechanical voice on the phone in Billion Dollar Brain (1967), starring Michael Caine as the spy Harry Palmer.\n\nAudiences took notice when they saw him in The Dirty Dozen. In one scene with Lee Marvin and Robert Ryan, Pvt. Pinkley pretends to be a general and inspects the troops. Sutherland recalled that he got to do the comic bit after another actor declined. \"You with the big ears, you do it,\" director Robert Aldrich said.\n\n\"It was shot with unblimped Arriflex cameras. We were in a room by ourselves,\" he said. \"I don't know about Julie, but I'm never naked in front of somebody! I'm not even naked in front of my children. I'm naked in front of my wife -- that's it. I was shy. For a couple of very specific reasons, she was physically shy. But we got over our shyness, went into the room and were standing like Adam and Eve waiting for somebody to give us an apple.\"\n\nHis lengthly film r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also included The Split (1968); Paul Mazursky's Alex in Wonderland (1970); Start the Revolution Without Me (1970); Little Murders (1971), in a reunion with Gould; John Schlesinger's The Day of the Locust (1975), a mordant look at Hollywood; The Eagle Has Landed (1976); Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 (1976); The Eye of the Needle (1981); Max Dugan Returns (1983); Oliver Stone's JFK (1991); A Time to Kill (1996); as track coach Bill Bowerman in Without Limits (1998); Clint Eastwood's Space Cowboys (2000); a remake of Pride & Prejudice (2005); American Gun (2005); Ask the Dust (2006); Man on the Train (2011); The Leisure Seeker (2017); and The Burnt Orange Heresy (2020).\n\nSutherland once set up his own production company but quickly decided it wasn't in his best interest. \"For me, it's better to find a director who wants to make a film,\" he told Drama-Logue magazine. \"To tailor something for someone is like grabbing a dog by the tail and walking him down the street.\"\n\nIn 1995, he won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his performance as a Soviet cop in the HBO telefilm Citizen X. He received a Globe for playing Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford in the 2002 HBO miniseries Path to War and starred as an insidious Speaker of the House opposite Geena Davis as the U.S. president in the 2005-06 ABC drama Commander in Chief.\n\nMore recently, Sutherland found regular TV work on Dirty Sexy Money, The Pillars of the Earth, Crossing Lines, Ice, Trust (playing J. Paul Getty), The Undoing and Lawman: Bass Reeves.\n\nSutherland was married to and divorced from actresses Lois Hardwick and Shirley Douglas (the mother of Kiefer and his twin sister, veteran Hollywood postproduction supervisor Rachel Sutherland) before he became romantically involved with Racette.\n\n(Kiefer was named for Warren Kiefer, the director of Castle of the Living Dead, and Roeg was named for Nicolas Roeg.)\n\nAs he closed his entertaining Oscar acceptance speech, Sutherland said he had been \"beset by my mind's unrelenting interrogation of me demanding if I deserve this.\"\n\n\"I finally found peace in the words of the great Benjamin Kubelsky, who is also known as Jack Benny, when he said, as I say to you now: 'I don't deserve this, but I have arthritis, and I don't deserve that either.'\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_barnes@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Mike Barnes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "duane_bygre@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Duane Bygre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Roeg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veep", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governors Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

He starred in acclaimed movies of the 1970s and '80s, including M*A*S*H, Klute, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Ordinary People.\n\nHis role as President Snow, the quietly sadistic antagonist in The Hunger Games franchise, made him a recognizable face among a new generation, as did his role in 2005's Pride and Prejudice.\n\nWATCH | Sutherland on getting an honourary Oscar 65 years into his career:\n\nActor Donald Sutherland, at TIFF for his new road trip movie The Leisure Seekers, shares what it means to be named an honorary Oscar-winner.\n\nHe portrayed real-life figures from Canadian history throughout his career and spoke proudly about his deep connection to the country.\n\nI'm a Canadian.

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nWillie Mays, Giants' electrifying 'Say Hey Kid,' has died at 93\n\nThe Giants center fielder, with his signature basket catch, was one of the game's greatest and most beloved players and had been baseball's oldest living Hall of Famer.\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nJerry West, a 3-time Hall of Fame selection and the NBA logo, dies at 86\n\nJerry West, nicknamed \"Mr. Clutch\" for late-game exploits, went into the Hall of Fame as a player in 1980 and again as a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team.\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford. For a career launched by \"M.A.S.H.\" it was a fitting, if ironic bookend.\n\nDonald Sutherland: A look at the award-winning actor's life and career, in photos 1971: Donald Sutherland, Jane Fonda 1971: Donald Sutherland, Jane Fonda 1977: Donald Sutherland, Haskell Wexler 1978: Donald Sutherland, Bette Midler 1978: Donald Sutherland, John Belushi 1995: Donald Sutherland wins Emmy for \"Citizen X\" 1996: Donald Sutherland wins Golden Globe for \"Citizen X\" 1999: Donald Sutherland 2000: Donald Sutherland 2005: Donald Sutherland 2005: Donald Sutherland 2008: Donald Sutherland 2008: Donald Sutherland, William Baldwin 2008: Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland 2009: Donald Sutherland in \"The Pillars of the Earth\" 2009: Donald Sutherland 2010: Donald Sutherland at Vancouver Olympics 2010: Donald Sutherland 2011: Donald Sutherland honored on Hollywood Walk of Fame 2012: Donald Sutherland 2012: Donald Sutherland at premiere of \"The Hunger Games\" 2014: Donald Sutherland 2014: Donald Sutherland 2015: Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland 2016: Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland 2016: Donald Sutherland 2017: Donald Sutherland, Helen Mirren 2017: Donald Sutherland 2017: Donald Sutherland receives honorary Oscar 2018: Donald Sutherland 2019: Donald Sutherland, Mick Jagger 2019: Donald Sutherland 2019: Donald Sutherland Photos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

The iconic actor was known for his long list of versatile roles in films and TV shows like M*A*S*H, Klute, The Hunger Games, Ordinary People, The Dirty Dozen and Without Limits.\n\nHis son, Kiefer Sutherland, confirmed the news of his father's passing on X, formerly known as Twitter, honouring him by calling the Hollywood giant \"one of the most important actors in the history of film\" and commending him for a life \"well lived.\"\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away.

People from all walks of life were deeply imprinted by Sutherland's work, and shared heartfelt messages to honour the memory of the great talent.\n\n\"I was deeply, deeply starstruck. He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft and truly, truly a great Canadian artist who will be deeply missed,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Nova Scotia on Thursday where he learned of the actor's passing during the presser.\n\n\"RIP Donald Sutherland, 88.\n\nOne of my all-time favourite actors who played so many great roles. What a sad loss,\" Morgan posted online.\n\n\"I was blessed to direct him in #Backdraft. One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence,\" director Ron Howard penned in his note.\n\n\"R.I.P. Donald Sutherland - the best of all Donalds,\" wrote Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk.\n\nEarlier in June, a film and TV reviewer on X, formerly known as Twitter, asked people to list their favourite Donald Sutherland film ever with many returning answers including 24, Kelly's Heroes, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, A Time To Kill, Animal House, Don't Look Now and The Hunger Games movies.\n\n\"I haven't seen a lot Donald Sutherland has been in, and yet he's a great actor.\n\nI guess it'd be a 3 way tie between Invasion of The Body Snatchers, Outbreak, and Fallen,\" said a film enthusiast only beginning to discover the greatness of Sutherland.\n\n\"Oh man, legendary actor Donald Sutherland has just passed away at 88 years of age.\n\nI've been watching his movies since I was a little kid, Invasion of the Body Snatchers was my first one. What an incredible career, and a big loss for the acting world. Rest in power,\" said a Donald Sutherland fan online.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s.\n\nRelated Story: When Willie Mays Played in Fresno, the Fans Watched 'From Trees and ...\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nRelated Story: NBA Legend and Logo Jerry West Dies at 86\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford. For a career launched by \"M.A.S.H.\" it was a fitting, if ironic bookend.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com",

A life well lived,\" he wrote while sharing black and white photo of the duo together.\n\nReacting to his post, producer Ben Everard wrote: \"THE DIRTY DOZEN is an absolute all timer, as are many of his classics. RIP to a wonderful actor.\"\n\nExtending condolences to Sutherland family, one X user wrote, \"So sorry for your loss. Your dad was an incredible actor whose work will stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"Your Dad was one of my all time favorites. M.A.S.H. so many other tremendous performances. My favorite was his cameo in JFK. R.I.P. Mr. Sutherland. Peace to the Sutherland Family,\" one more chimed in.\n\nSutherland, who was born in 1935 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and had a more than seven-decade cinematic career, was well-known for his appearances in Pride and Prejudice, M*A*S*H, The Hunger Games, and Ad Astra, among many more films.\n\nThe Canadian received two awards: a Golden Globe for the television film Path To War and an Emmy for the miniseries Citizen X. He was also honored with an Academy Honorary Award in 2017 for his brilliant acting.\n\nSutherland's most recent performances were as a judge in the 2023 TV series Lawmen: Bass Reeves and as Coriolanus Snow, dictator president, in the Hunger Games film franchise.\n\nAlso Read: Joe Flaherty dies at 82: A look at SCTV star's iconic film and television roles\n\nHe was bestowed with numerous accolades throughout his life, such as inductions into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011 and the Canadian Walk of Fame in 2000. In addition to being named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2019, Sutherland was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1978 and a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2012. Canada Post released a stamp honouring him in October 2023, marking his remarkable career as one of the country's most esteemed and diverse actors.\n\nSutherland, was the father to the 57-year-old actor Kiefer Sutherland, winner of an Emmy, and seasoned CAA Media Finance executive Roeg Sutherland.\n\nHis many television appearances include Trust, The Pillars of the Earth and Dirty Sexy Money.\n\nHe is survived by wife Francine Racette, four sons -- Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel; and four grandkids.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homage (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\nKiefer Sutherland continued to write that his father \"loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nTall, distinctive and known for his intensity on screen, Sutherland earned an Emmy for his role as a Soviet official in the fact-based 1995 TV movie \"Citizen X,\" as well as a pair of Golden Globes. His career spanned more than 60 years and nearly 200 film and TV credits, including recent roles in the limited series \"Trust\" as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty and HBO's \"The Undoing.\"\n\nSutherland's big break came when he was cast as one of \"The Dirty Dozen\" in the star-studded 1967 film, which became a major hit. He followed that with another war movie, \"Kelly's Heroes,\" before playing the wisecracking doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the movie version of \"M*A*S*H\" and opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a high-class \"call girl\" in the crime mystery \"Klute.\" (Fonda and Sutherland also had an off-screen relationship around the time that they made the film.)\n\nReflecting his ability to play all sorts of roles, Sutherland's 1970s resume included a chillingly effective remake of the horror film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and a memorable turn as a pot-smoking professor in the National Lampoon comedy \"Animal House.\"\n\nHe also starred opposite Julie Christie in director Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a 1973 movie that became somewhat notorious for the raciness of its sex scene, which had to be trimmed in order to avoid an X rating.\n\nA steady stream of roles followed in a wide variety of genres, from a small but pivotal part in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" to supporting work in \"Ordinary People\" (which won the Oscar for best picture), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Backdraft\" and \"The Italian Job.\"\n\nSutherland also starred as the legendary lover for director Federico Fellini in \"Fellini's Casanova.\" Many younger filmgoers, meanwhile, will likely remember him as the evil president in \"The Hunger Games\" movies.\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland endured several bouts of ill health as a child, including polio. He attended the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering before gravitating toward drama and appearing on stage, graduating with degrees in both.\n\nThe 6'4\" actor met his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in college, and the two married in 1959. He moved to London, where he found some stage work, and eventually to Hollywood in the 1960s, where \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"M*A*S*H\" put him on the map.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he divorced, marrying actress Shirley Douglas, whom he met while filming the horror movie \"Castle of the Living Dead.\" They had two children, actor Kiefer and Rachel, who also works in film as a post-production supervisor. That marriage also ended in divorce, and in 1972 Sutherland wed his third wife, actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons.\n\nIn a 2020 conversation with \"The Undoing\" costar Hugh Grant for Interview magazine, Sutherland said that he was always so nervous when a movie began shooting that he threw up the night before. He also discussed subtly altering his dialogue, as he put it, to \"try to make the lines that I've been given fit my mouth.\"\n\nSutherland appeared in three films with son Kiefer, beginning with the \"24\" star's small part in the comedy-drama \"Max Dugan Returns\" in 1983, followed by the John Grisham adaptation \"A Time to Kill.\" The two didn't perform in a scene together, however, until the 2016 western \"Forsaken.\"\n\n\"It was a memory and an experience that I will treasure for the rest of my life,\" Kiefer Sutherland told \"Good Morning America\" at the time, saying he spent years looking for something that the two could do together.\n\nAsked what advice he would give young actors, Sutherland told Reuters in 2019, \"Try and be as truthful as you possibly can, read, read a lot, learn, memorize things, enjoy your artistry, study dancing, be a circus performer, learn how to juggle, so many things, but mostly you have to observe.\"\n\nSutherland received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board in 2017 and was honored with the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 2022, Sutherland appeared alongside Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson in the space thriller \"Moonfall\" and in the Roku TV mini series \"Swimming with Sharks.\" His final credit came in 2023, with the actor starring in the Paramount+ western drama \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that,\" the younger Sutherland wrote on X. \"A life well lived.\"\n\nWith a height of six-foot-four, big blue eyes and deep, dulcet tones, the elder Sutherland was a striking and unmistakable presence in film, television and radio for over 50 years.\n\nHis varied film roles included snarky surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in \"MASH,\" Julie Christie's troubled husband in the thriller \"Don't Look Now,\" and a Washington intelligence officer in Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\"\n\nOn TV, he played the Speaker of the House in \"Commander in Chief\" and the rich patriarch in \"Dirty, Sexy, Money.\"\n\nThough he was in over 100 films, Sutherland was never nominated for an Academy Award. He did, however, receive an honorary Oscar in 2017, as well as two BAFTA nominations, an Emmy Award and two Golden Globes.\n\nHe was also an officer of the Order of Canada and won a Genie and a Governor General's Performing Arts Award.\n\nAs Sutherland worked around the world, he maintained a home in Quebec's Eastern Townships, where he would host dinner parties for his famous family and celebrity friends.\n\n\"I love this country,\" Sutherland said when he received the Governor General's Award in 2000.\n\n\"You know, (W.H.) Auden, the English poet, said that a poet's hope is to be like some valley cheese: local, but prized elsewhere. I kind of feel like that.\"\n\nSutherland was born in Saint John and raised in Bridgewater, N.S. His father, Frederick Sutherland, was a salesman and his mother, Dorothy Isobel, a mathematics teacher. Various reports say Sutherland battled polio, rheumatic fever and hepatitis as a child.\n\nAt age 14, Sutherland landed a part-time job as a DJ and news broadcaster for local radio station CKBW. It was the start of a successful side career in multimedia voice-over work -- something son Kiefer also pursued.\n\nSutherland studied drama, engineering and English at the University of Toronto, where he played to audiences at the Hart House Theatre and met his first wife of seven years, Lois Hardwick. His memories of toga parties at U of T's Gate House residence were said to be the inspiration for the 1978 film \"Animal House,\" in which he co-starred.\n\nAfter getting his degree in 1958, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in England and went on to act with the Perth Repertory Theatre in Scotland and on London's West End.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he transitioned into features, including the thrillers \"Castle of the Living Dead,\" \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" and \"Die! Die! My Darling!\" He also landed small roles on TV series including \"Court Martial,\" \"The Saint\" and \"The Avengers.\"\n\nIn 1966, Sutherland married his second wife, Canadian actress and activist Shirley Douglas, daughter of medicare founder Tommy Douglas. That same year they had twins Rachel and Kiefer, who has become a star in his own right with films including \"The Lost Boys\" and the TV series \"24.\"\n\nWhen Sutherland saw that his son wanted to follow in his footsteps, he gave him one important piece of advice:\n\n\"I don't care what you do with your life,\" Kiefer Sutherland, quoting his dad, said in a 1998 interview with The Canadian Press.\n\n\"Just don't lie in your work, because they'll catch you.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland's breakthrough in the U.S. came in 1967 with the film \"The Dirty Dozen,\" in which he played an imprisoned soldier during the Second World War. Co-stars included Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson.\n\nThree years later, he further solidified his star status in Hollywood with two more war films: Robert Altman's Oscar-winning Korean War satire \"MASH,\" and \"Kelly's Heroes,\" alongside Clint Eastwood and Telly Savalas.\n\nThe '70s were a particularly active time for Sutherland with varied roles in two-dozen other projects, including \"Klute,\" \"Fellini's Casanova,\" \"Animal House,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"Don't Look Now\" and \"Steelyard Blues.\" The latter two films earned him nominations for a best-actor BAFTA.\n\nSutherland's private life also made headlines during that decade.\n\nFirst came his highly publicized relationship with his \"Klute\" co-star, Jane Fonda, with whom he also helped form an anti-war road show called the FTA tour (Free The Army). Later, Sutherland married French-Canadian actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons: Roeg, Angus and Rossif, star of \"Poor Boy's Game\" and \"High Life.\"\n\nIn the '80s, Sutherland continued to build his resume at a feverish pace, with turns in nearly 20 films including Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People,\" for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe, and \"Threshold,\" which earned him a Genie.\n\nSutherland eventually won two Golden Globes: in 1996 for his supporting role in \"Citizen X,\" for which he also earned an Emmy, then in 2003 for the HBO film \"Path to War.\" That same year he played a minister in \"Cold Mountain.\"\n\nHe also got to work with his actor-sons, sharing the screen with Kiefer in the films \"Max Dugan Returns\" and \"A Time to Kill,\" and with Rossif in \"The Steal Artist.\"\n\nRossif Sutherland said working with his dad was \"a dream.\"\n\n\"He's been the reason for which I've started a road in this career and he likes to call himself my first fan,\" he told The Canadian Press in January 2010.\n\n\"He's the one person that I've worked with that gives the impression that I can do no wrong.\"\n\nFor actor Peter Krause, working with Sutherland on \"Dirty, Sexy, Money\" was \"a real trip.\"\n\n\"He's a total character,\" Krause said in a May 2007 interview with The Canadian Press. \"A really interesting guy.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Colonist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General's_Performing_Arts_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor General's Performing Arts Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander in Chief (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Townships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Townships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baritone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" he said.\n\n\"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland starred in films including The Dirty Dozen, MASH and Klute.\n\nOne of the Canadian actor's breakout roles was as Hawkeye Pierce, a surgeon in the 1970 film version of MASH, a comedy about medics in the Korean War.\n\nSutherland had almost 200 credits to his name.\n\nBorn in New Brunswick, Canada, Sutherland started as a radio news reporter before leaving Canada to travel to London in 1957. There, he studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nHe then took on small roles in British film and television.\n\nSutherland starred in The Dirty Dozen, a World War II action film that premiered in 1967.\n\nHis off-kilter presence saw him land another war film role as the appropriately named Sergeant Oddball, in Kelly's Heroes.\n\nYet he was on more restrained form in 1971's Klute, playing a detective whose hunt for a missing person is assisted by a high-priced call girl.\n\nJane Fonda was Sutherland's co-star in Alan J Pakula's film and won an Oscar for her role.\n\nHe dated Fonda for two years before the couple split.\n\nIn the 1973 thriller Don't Look Now, a sex scene of such frankness had viewers believe he and co-star Julie Christie had had sex for real - a rumour Sutherland later discounted.\n\nThe 1970s also saw him play an IRA member in The Eagle Has Landed, a pot-smoking college professor in National Lampoon's Animal House, and the lead in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sutherland played the father of a suicidal teenager in the Oscar-winning Ordinary People.\n\nHe turned to television in the 2000s, appearing in such series as Dirty Sexy Money and Commander-in-Chief.\n\nDespite his numerous roles that span 150 films, the Canadian actor was never nominated for an Oscar, but did receive an honorary Academy Award in 2017.\n\nSutherland was also known for his political activism throughout his career. He protested the US war in Vietnam alongside Fonda. Some of their efforts were chronicled in the 1972 documentary F.T.A.\n\nSutherland also channeled his beliefs into some of his roles, including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, released in 2015. Sutherland played the tyrannical President Snow, the target of heroine Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, as she sought to assassinate Snow and liberate her fellow citizens.\n\nSutherland told BBC News in 2015 that he hoped the film's socio-political message will help young fans become more aware of the world around them. In the film, Panem is a society where an elite class rules over poverty-stricken masses.\n\n\"I have been convinced for the last 30 years that they weren't thinking politically at all,\" says Sutherland. \"The purpose of everybody involved in this was try to get them engaged. As Bruce Springsteen said, 'Blind faith in your leaders... will get you killed.'\"\n\nHis death comes months before his memoir was set to be released, Made Up, But Still True, a book about his personal journey as an actor.\n\nIn 2015, Sutherland told BBC News that one of the biggest changes he's noticed in the industry over his career is that recent actors were making \"a lot of money\".\n\n\"I don't think anybody of my generation became an actor to make money. It never occurred to me. I made \u00a38 a week here [on stage in London]. When I starred in a play at the Royal Court, I made \u00a317 a week, that was in 1964,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, he said he has no plans to retire from acting.\n\n\"It's a passionate endeavour.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nA prolific actor who appeared in more than 190 films and TV shows, Sutherland embodied an off-kilter appeal that served him brilliantly in a series of classic 1970s movies, which gradually evolved into a veteran gravitas in the latter stages of his career.\n\nHe did not win a major award for any of his film roles (and was never nominated for a conventional Oscar), but did win two Golden Globes for best supporting actor for the TV movies Citizen X (in 1996) and Path to War (in 2003). Sutherland received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nBorn in Canada in 1935, Sutherland studied engineering and drama at the University of Toronto, and opted to move to London in 1957 to join an acting class at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda).\n\nAfter a series of small roles on British TV shows including Man of the World, The Saint and The Avengers, and films such as the Hammer horror film Fanatic and the Amicus anthology Dr Terror's House of Horrors, Sutherland was cast in the action film The Dirty Dozen, as one of a group of prisoners trained up for a dangerous mission during the second world war.\n\nThe Dirty Dozen was a hit and Sutherland then appeared in two more war films with anti-heroic sensibilities: the massively influential Korean War comedy M*A*S*H, in which Sutherland played rule-bending surgeon \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, and Kelly's Heroes, as a whacked-out tank commander who joins Clint Eastwood's bank robbery.\n\nWhile working on the latter film, in 1968, Sutherland said he \"died for a few seconds\" as a result of contracting meningitis.\n\nSutherland's work became more radical: he played the title role in Klute, opposite Jane Fonda's sex worker, as a detective investigating a murder in the first of director Alan J Pakula's so-called \"paranoia trilogy\" and appeared with Fonda in the anti-Vietnam War documentary FTA.\n\nIn 2017, declassified documents showed that Sutherland, a vocal anti-war activist, was on the National Security Agency's \"watch list\" between 1971 and 1973.\n\nSutherland then embarked on a wide variety of roles as he attained leading man status.\n\nIn 1973 he starred opposite Julie Christie in Don't Look Now, the Nicolas Roeg-directed psychological horror, which contained a then-infamous sex scene, intercut with Christie and Sutherland getting dressed, which Sutherland was repeatedly forced to deny was authentic.\n\nHe then starred in Federico Fellini's Casanova, played murderous fascist Attila Melanchini in Bernardo Bertolucci's epic 1900, and featured alongside Michael Caine as a duplicitous IRA man in war thriller The Eagle Has Landed.\n\nHe played a dope-smoking professor in National Lampoon's Animal House, and fought \"pod people\" in a remake of the horror sci-fi Invasion of the Body Snatchers - giving rise to a popular gif of the film's final moments.\n\nIn 1980 he led an impressive ensemble cast in Robert Redford's directorial debut, Ordinary People, after Gene Hackman had dropped out of the role.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s Sutherland was mostly cast in character roles, including an art dealer in Six Degrees of Separation, the mysterious Mr \"X\" in Oliver Stone's JFK who suggests there is a high-level coup inside the US government, and slayer trainer Merrick Jamison-Smythe in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie starring Kristy Swanson.\n\nSutherland also had prominent roles in the legal thriller A Time to Kill (alongside his son Kiefer), the astronaut drama Space Cowboys and the Jane Austen adaptation Pride & Prejudice.\n\nIn 2012 his role as the villainous President Snow in The Hunger Games introduced him to a new generation of filmgoers. He also starred in Stephen King horror Mr Harrigan's Phone and disaster thriller Moonfall in 2022.\n\nMost recently, he had a recurring role in TV series Lawmen: Bass Reeves with David Oyelowo.\n\nSutherland was married three times, to Lois Hardwick between 1959 and 1966, Shirley Douglas (1966-1970) and Francine Racette, whom he married in 1972.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com",

He was 88 years old.\n\nHis son, fellow actor Kiefer Sutherland, announced the news on social media Thursday.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nThe post included a black and white photo, featuring Kiefer as a toddler with his dad.\n\nCelebrities and fans reacted to the post, with many sharing condolences, as well as praise for beloved actor, who received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\n\"Sorry for your loss,\" wrote Karl Kaufman. \"Such and incredible filmography, including Klute, Hunger Games, Don't Look Now, Animal House, and especially M*A*S*H.\"\n\nI loved your father in all his roles. We've lost a legend in losing Donald Sutherland.

I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" he said.\n\n\"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland starred in films including The Dirty Dozen, MASH and Klute.\n\nOne of the Canadian actor's breakout roles was as Hawkeye Pierce, a surgeon in the 1970 film version of MASH, a comedy about medics in the Korean War.\n\nSutherland had almost 200 credits to his name.\n\nBorn in New Brunswick, Canada, Sutherland started as a radio news reporter before leaving Canada to travel to London in 1957. There, he studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nHe then took on small roles in British film and television.\n\nSutherland starred in The Dirty Dozen, a World War II action film that premiered in 1967.\n\nHis off-kilter presence saw him land another war film role as the appropriately named Sergeant Oddball, in Kelly's Heroes.\n\nYet he was on more restrained form in 1971's Klute, playing a detective whose hunt for a missing person is assisted by a high-priced call girl.\n\nJane Fonda was Sutherland's co-star in Alan J Pakula's film and won an Oscar for her role.\n\nHe dated Fonda for two years before the couple split.\n\nIn the 1973 thriller Don't Look Now, a sex scene of such frankness had viewers believe he and co-star Julie Christie had had sex for real - a rumour Sutherland later discounted.\n\nThe 1970s also saw him play an IRA member in The Eagle Has Landed, a pot-smoking college professor in National Lampoon's Animal House, and the lead in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sutherland played the father of a suicidal teenager in the Oscar-winning Ordinary People.\n\nHe turned to television in the 2000s, appearing in such series as Dirty Sexy Money and Commander-in-Chief.\n\nDespite his numerous roles that span 150 films, the Canadian actor was never nominated for an Oscar, but did receive an honorary Academy Award in 2017.\n\nSutherland was also known for his political activism throughout his career. He protested the US war in Vietnam alongside Fonda. Some of their efforts were chronicled in the 1972 documentary F.T.A.\n\nSutherland also channeled his beliefs into some of his roles, including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, released in 2015. Sutherland played the tyrannical President Snow, the target of heroine Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, as she sought to assassinate Snow and liberate her fellow citizens.\n\nSutherland told BBC News in 2015 that he hoped the film's socio-political message will help young fans become more aware of the world around them. In the film, Panem is a society where an elite class rules over poverty-stricken masses.\n\n\"I have been convinced for the last 30 years that they weren't thinking politically at all,\" says Sutherland. \"The purpose of everybody involved in this was try to get them engaged. As Bruce Springsteen said, 'Blind faith in your leaders... will get you killed.'\"\n\nHis death comes months before his memoir was set to be released, Made Up, But Still True, a book about his personal journey as an actor.\n\nIn 2015, Sutherland told BBC News that one of the biggest changes he's noticed in the industry over his career is that recent actors were making \"a lot of money\".\n\n\"I don't think anybody of my generation became an actor to make money. It never occurred to me. I made KSh. 1308 (\u00a38) a week here [on stage in London]. When I starred in a play at the Royal Court, I made KSh. 2780 (\u00a317) a week, that was in 1964,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, he said he has no plans to retire from acting.\n\n\"It's a passionate endeavour. Retirement for actors is spelt 'DEATH'.\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "kbc.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBC | Kenya's Watching"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I love to work.

I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900''), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily.

legacy of playing both heroes and...", "body": "Canadian actor Donald Sutherland has died aged 88 following \"a long illness\", his agent confirmed to the PA news agency.\n\nHe rose to fame after starring in films such as The Dirty Dozen (1967) and Kelly's Heroes (1970).\n\nHe is perhaps best known as the womanising Captain Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr in the 1970 film version of M*A*S*H, and would eventually becoming a leading campaigner against war.\n\nMore recently, Sutherland featured in The Hunger Games film franchise as dictator president Coriolanus Snow, and as a judge in the 2023 TV show, Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\n\nKiefer Sutherland has paid tribute to his father who has died aged 88 (Ian West/PA).\n\nSutherland was born on July 17 1935, in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, before moving to the town of Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe actor had infantile paralysis and rheumatic fever before almost dying from spinal meningitis as a child.\n\nAfter graduating from university, he moved to Britain to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda), and began to land small roles in British films and TV shows.\n\nIn 1967, following a second appearance alongside Roger Moore in The Saint, Sutherland was handed the role of Vernon L Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen - a box office hit.\n\nHis later films included The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), The First Great Train Robbery (1978) and JFK (1991).\n\nSutherland won a Golden Globe along with an Emmy Award for the mini-series Citizen X (1995), and another gong for the television movie Path To War (2002).\n\nSutherland's son, Kiefer, called his father \"one of the most important actors in the history of film\" following his death.\n\nIn 2019, Kiefer said he broke down in tears after discovering his father's acting work.\n\nThe actor said he was unaware of his father's career, and the \"extraordinary\" work he had done until he was old enough to watch his films.\n\nEqually adept at playing heroes and villains, Sutherland portrayed President Snow, the main antagonist of The Hunger Games film franchise, beginning in 2012.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Sutherland would receive an Honorary Oscar, from the Academy.\n\nSutherland was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1978, promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2019.\n\nSutherland was about to publish his memoir, Made Up, But Still True, later this year, which was set to explore \"an unfiltered account of his memories of his life\" from how life-changing a role M*A*S*H had been along with \"his far too many brushes with death\".\n\nSutherland married three times.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Francine Racette, and five children, including actors Kiefer, Rossif and Angus.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 88. He is survived by his third wife, Francine Racette, and five children, including the actor Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nIn a press statement, Kiefer Sutherland said: \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in New Brunswick in Canada. He studied engineering and drama, and formally trained as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nAfter a series of minor roles in British films and television shows, Sutherland moved to Hollywood in the late 1960s. In 1970, two war-themed movies, M.A.S.H and Kelly's Heroes, paved the way for a career that would eventually span continents.\n\nOver the years, Sutherland stacked up credits across genres and styles. Here is a small selection of his best-known roles, which include Don't Look Now, Casanova and The Hunger Games.\n\nM.A.S.H\n\nIn Robert Altman's black comedy, set during the Korean War and based at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, Sutherland plays irreverent surgeon Hawkeye Pierce. The ensemble comedy gave Sutherland plenty of funny lines and firmly established his talent for comedy.\n\nJohnny Got His Gun\n\nIn another critique of war from the 1970s, Sutherland plays a hippie Jesus Christ. (Sutherland was also a vocal anti-war proponent off screen). Johnny Got His Gun was persecuted writer Dalton Trumbo's only film, and is about a severely disabled soldier who demands to be euthanised.\n\nKlute\n\nAmong the most enduring anti-establishment films of the decade is Alan J Pakula's Klute (1971). Jane Fonda plays a prostitute who gets dragged into an unsolved crime, and Sutherland is the titular detective assigned to keep an eye on her.\n\nDon't Look Now\n\nRoutinely featured on 'Greatest Films Ever Made' lists, Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973) is a devastating study of a marriage torn apart by the death of a child. A couple (Sutherland and Julie Christie) moves to Venice after their daughter dies, only to encounter a strange pair of sisters, one of whom warns them that another death is about to take place. The exploration of the uncanny makes room for beauty and tendresse, best captured by a frank lovemaking scene between the lead pair.\n\nThe Day of the Locust\n\nIn John Schlesinger's The Day of the Locust (1973), a bilious critique of Hollywood, Sutherland played a sexually repressed accountant who shares his name with one of the most well-known American television characters - Homer Simpson.\n\nFellini's Casanova\n\nOne of Sutherland's most well-known roles was beyond Hollywood - in the Italian master director Federico Fellini's Fellini's Casanova (1976). Sutherland wore a prosthetic nose and chin for the film, and was completely in sync with Fellini's simultaneously bawdy and flinty vision.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers\n\nIn this second version of Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers (the first was by Don Siegel), Philip Kaufman directs Sutherland as a government official who begins to realise that an alien invasion is underway. Sutherland offers an emotional core amidst the escalating dread, and is particularly effective in the iconic final scene, when it all goes to pot.\n\nOrdinary People\n\nIn Robert Redford's Ordinary People (1980), Sutherland revisited the theme of parents coping with a child's death. Sutherland plays a father attempting to keep the peace even as his wife (Mary Tyler Moore) struggles to deal with their surviving son.\n\nThe Hunger Games trilogy\n\nWell into his late seventies, Sutherland found a new generation of fans by appearing as the ruthless dictator Coriolanus Snow in the Hunger Games movies. In this clip from Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015), Snow reveals that just how deep his understanding is of the pursuit of power.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"},

And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles.\n\nHe was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"},

Sharing a photo of the pair together from back when Kiefer was a toddler, Sutherland said that his father \"loved what he did, and did what he loved,\" and called him \"one of the most important actors in the history of film.\" Sharing the brief statement to Instagram and other social media platforms, Sutherland quickly received hundreds of sympathetic comments, including from other celebrities who know the family personally.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, on July 17, 1935. His biggest acting break on the big screen came in the 1967 World War II drama The Dirty Dozen, where he played Vernon Pinkley. Sutherland is also known for his iconic roles in The Hunger Games franchise, MASH, Animal House, and much more. He is a former Emmy winner for his role in Citizen X, and is a 2017 Honorary Oscar recipient.\n\nYou can see the post below.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Kiefer Sutherland (@kiefersutherland)\n\nKiefer is one of Donald's four sons, along with his brothers Roeg, Rossif and Angus. Donald Sutherland also had a daughter, Rachel. Kiefer and Donald Sutherland appeared in a number of projects together, including followed in his father's footsteps as an actor, and the father-son duo starred together in projects several times throughout the years, including the movies \"Max Dugan Returns\" (1983), \"Forsaken\" (2015) and \"A Time to Kill\" (1996). He never actually shared the screen with his father until 2016's Forsaken.\n\n\"We had never actually exchanged a line of dialogue together, but I've watched him my whole life, and to have the opportunity to work with him was something I've wanted for my whole career,\" Sutherland told Good Morning America at the time. \"I think he's an unbelievable physical actor, and there was something that he was doing in that scene with his hand that caught my eye, and I was thinking as an actor, 'I should remember that, that's really cool,' but I thought, 'Well, maybe it would have been better if I remembered the dialogue I was supposed to say at that moment.'\"\n\nSutherland was recently added to the cast of the Paramount+ series Lawmen: Bass Reeves as Judge Isaac Parker, an imposing and commanding judge in the Fort Smith Courthouse with a complicated legacy. The anthology series hails from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Charles_Parker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Charles Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Time_to_Kill_(Grisham_novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Time to Kill (Grisham novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bass Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthology series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Sheridan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Sheridan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smith,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Smith, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Smith, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen Actors Guild Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/05/19/9d906649-0609-4f5b-92c6-78ccab0ae66f/kiefer-sutherland-getty-images.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 779, "textEnd": 786}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

His impressive career spanned over six decades, making him a household name and a versatile actor who left a lasting legacy in the film industry.\n\nBorn on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland faced numerous health challenges in his early years, including rheumatic fever, hepatitis, and polio. Despite these obstacles, he developed a passion for the arts while attending Victoria University in Toronto, where he double-majored in engineering and drama.\n\nAfter graduating, Sutherland decided to pursue acting and moved to England in 1957 to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He then honed his craft at the Perth Repertory Theatre in Scotland before embarking on a career in British television and film.\n\nSutherland's breakthrough came in 1967 with his role in the classic war film \"The Dirty Dozen.\" This success prompted him to move to Hollywood, where he starred in a series of notable films including \"MAS*H\" (1970), \"Klute\" (1971), and \"Don't Look Now\" (1973). His ability to transition between genres, from horror to thriller to science fiction, showcased his versatility as an actor.\n\nThroughout the 70s and 80s, Sutherland continued to secure significant roles in films such as \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978), \"Ordinary People\" (1980), and \"A Dry White Season\" (1989). He also made a mark on television, with performances in series like \"Commander in Chief\" and \"Trust.\"\n\nIn the 90s and 2000s, Sutherland appeared in high-profile films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Disclosure\" (1994), and \"The Italian Job\" (2003). His portrayal of President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise brought him widespread recognition among a new generation of moviegoers.\n\nDespite his successful career, Sutherland experienced a notable financial blunder related to the 1978 film \"Animal House.\" Initially offered 2.5% of the film's profits plus a salary of $35,000, Sutherland declined, underestimating the film's potential. Universal Studios then increased the offer to $35,000 plus 15% of the gross earnings, which he again declined, ultimately settling for an up-front payment of $50,000. \"Animal House\" went on to gross $141 million, and Sutherland's decision cost him a substantial fortune.\n\nDonald Sutherland was married three times and fathered five children, including Kiefer Sutherland, Rossif Sutherland, and Angus Sutherland, who followed in their father's footsteps into the entertainment industry. Sutherland's marriages included unions with Lois Hardwick, Shirley Douglas, and Francine Racette, with whom he remained until his passing.\n\nSutherland's personal life was as dynamic as his professional one. He named all of his sons after directors who had influenced his career, a testament to his deep connection to the film industry. Kiefer Sutherland, named after Warren Kiefer, achieved fame in his own right, further cementing the Sutherland family's legacy in Hollywood.\n\nDonald Sutherland's net worth of $60 million at the time of his death reflects a career filled with remarkable achievements and unforgettable performances.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Acting was part of his upbringing in Canada, but he was studying to become an engineer until he moved to the United Kingdom in his early 20s. He trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art while living in London in the 1950s, which led to his first roles in British media, including The Castle of the Living Dead (1964) and an adaptation of A Farewell to Arms (1966).\n\nHe starred in the 2003 remake of The Italian Job and 2005's Oscar-nominated Pride & Prejudice. Sutherland won another Golden Globe in 2003 for Path to War. He earned nine total Golden Globe nominations throughout his career and two total Emmy nominations. He received an Honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nOne of the most famous roles of the later stage of his career was as the villainous President Snow in The Hunger Games franchise. The character became the subject of the franchise's prequel film, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. One of his most recent roles was in Lawmen: Bass Reeves alongside David Oyelowo.\n\nSutherland was married three times. He was wed to Lois Hardwick from 1959-1966 and actress Shirley Douglas (mother to Kiefer and Rachel Sutherland) from 1966-1970. Sutherland had been married to Canadian actress Francine Racette since 1972 at the time of his death. Sutherland and Racette are also parents to Rossif, Angus, and Roeg Sutherland.", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He also had four grandchildren.\n\nKeifer said in a tribute: \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nIn a statement to the PA agency, CAA said: \"Acclaimed actor Donald Sutherland died today in Miami, Florida, after a long illness. He was 88 years old.\"\n\nA private celebration of life will be held by the family. Sutherland won a Golden Globe for the television movie Path To War and another gong along with an Emmy Award for the the mini-series Citizen X. In 2017 he received an Academy Honorary Award for his acting. Sutherland's most recent roles included The Hunger Games film franchise as dictator president Coriolanus Snow, and as a judge in the 2023 TV show Lawmen: Bass Reeves. Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nAs a child, he had rheumatic fever, hepatitis, and poliomyelitis. He started his first part-time job at the age of 14 as a news correspondent for local radio station CKBW. Sutherland went on to study at Victoria University, an affiliated college of the University of Toronto, where he met his first wife Lois May Hardwick. He graduated with a double major in engineering and drama.\n\nSutherland decided to head to Britain in 1957 where he studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He then went on to spend a year at the Perth Repertory Theatre in Scotland before gaining roles in British TV and films.\n\nHe racked up an impressive 200 film and TV credits throughout his career. His big break in movies came with Robert Aldrich's star-packed 1967 World War II drama The Dirty Dozen, playing Vernon Pinkley opposite Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, George Kennedy and Telly Savalas.\n\nSutherland received various honours throughout his life including inductions into the Canadian Walk of Fame in 2000 and Hollywood Walk of Fame 2011. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1978, a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2012 and received the Companion of the Order of Canada in 2019. In October 2023, Canada Post issued a stamp in his honour, commemorating his career as one of Canada's most respected and versatile actors.\n\nSutherland married three times throughout his life - first to Lois May Hardwick from 1959 to 1966 and then to Canadian actress Shirley Douglas from 1966 to 1970. Tributes have poured in for the actor as actor Morgan Freeman wrote: \"It was such an honor to be presented with the Crystal Nymph, a lifetime achievement award for acting by @festivaltvmonte_carlo! I now share this award with incredible previous winners such as Donald Sutherland, @helenmirren, and @michaelkirkdouglas. Thank you!\" Broadcaster Piers Morgan said: \"RIP Donald Sutherland, 88. One of my all-time favourite actors who played so many great roles. What a sad loss.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_brassington@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Jamie

He was 88.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" actor Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nThe elder Sutherland had a distinctive look -- and piercing eyes -- that brought a depth and mystery to the huge range of roles he inhabited over more than half a century on the big screen.\n\nOne of Canada's most famous sons, he played dashing leading men as well as antiheroes and villains, most recently making a name among a new generation of fans as the evil President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" wrote Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nReaction to the Emmy and Golden Globe-winner's death was swift, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailing his unique talents.\n\n\"I had the opportunity when I was much younger to meet Donald Sutherland, and even as a young man who hadn't had a full exposure to the depth of brilliance of Donald Sutherland, I was deeply, deeply star struck,\" he told a press conference.\n\n\"He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly, truly, a great Canadian artist, and he will be deeply missed.\"\n\nAfter what he himself termed a \"meandering\" start to his acting career, Donald Sutherland came to prominence in Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen,\" where 12 convicts are tasked with carrying out what appears to be a suicide mission in occupied France.\n\nStarring alongside luminaries such as Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas, Sutherland's impish charms caught the attention of producers of \"M*A*S*H.\"\n\nThough set in the Korean War, the 1970 film was widely seen as a sophisticated satire on the Vietnam War.\n\nHis casting opposite Elliott Gould turned Sutherland into a household name in 1970s America, and opened the door to a durable career that would see him work with some of the biggest names in show business.\n\nThey included Jane Fonda, with whom he starred in 1971's \"Klute,\" in which he played a detective who falls for the call girl he is supposed to be protecting.\n\nFonda won an Oscar for her performance, which she credited to her intense feelings for Sutherland, with whom she was in a relationship at the time.\n\nTheir off-screen chemistry brought Sutherland into her pacifist orbit, and he became active in anti-Vietnam War circles.\n\nThe pair put together a travelling revue, which irked the US government and landed them both under FBI surveillance.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [],

The sad news arrives to us via Deadline. With over 200 film and television credits to his name, Sutherland became a household name in the '70s. All thanks to films like The Dirty Dozen, M*A*S*H, Klute, and the suspense classic Don't Look Now. The Canadian-born actor also starred in movies such as JFK, Backdraft, and Pride and Prejudice, to name a few. Donald Sutherland capped off a legendary career with a villainous turn as President Snow in The Hunger Games franchise. Of course, he's also the father of another iconic actor in his own right, Kiefer Sutherland. We're very sorry to hear about the death of this legend.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born in 1935 in New Brunswick, Canada. At 20 years old, he departed Canada for the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Not too long after excelling there, he began appearing in several horror films with the iconic Christopher Lee. His big break in film came in 1968, starring in the blockbuster war movie The Dirty Dozen. He soon became one of Hollywood's most in-demand actors. He starred in serious dramas like Ordinary People, and raunchy comedies like Animal House, proving his versatility. Sutherland also racked up an impressive list of sci-fi and horror roles, like the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Puppet Masters, and as Buffy Summers' first Watcher in the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nThanks to his outspoken views about his opposition to the Vietnam War, Donald Sutherland found himself on a CIA watchlist in the early '70s, right as he became world famous. None of this hurt his career, though. Aside from his acting roles, in his later years, Sutherland became a blogger for The Huffington Post, chronicling the 2008 Presidential election. Despite his incredibly impressive resume, somehow, Donald Sutherland never received an Academy Award. However, the Academy granted him an honorary Oscar in 2017 for his lifetime of work. However, Sutherland won several Emmys and a pair of Golden Globes as well. Sutherland is survived by his wife, Canadian actress Francine Racette, and his five children. Although Sutherland's death is sad news indeed, few are likely to forget his storied career.", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher.

While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nOfficer driving truck in deadly beach accident is Horry's longtime beach safety director Suspect in $100K firearm robbery at Palmetto State Armory re-arrested after standoff Carnival's Charleston-based cruise ship gives passengers a 30-minute warning King Street nights: see what happens when 50,000 people pile into Charleston's entertainment district Man hacked co-worker to death with a machete at worksite, N.

A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nCharleston Scene Charleston's 'Outer Banks' star Madelyn Cline interviews vice president in new video By Kalyn Oyer koyer@postandcourier.com\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nBusiness 'Outer Banks,' other SC productions set to 'Take 2' as long Hollywood strike ends By Megan Fernandes mfernandes@postandcourier.com\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nWhen Kiefer Sutherland announced the death of his father, Donald Sutherland, at the age 88, he called him \"one of the most important actors in the history of film.\" If the claim sounds hyperbolic, it is borne out by celluloid history. The elder Sutherland's film career began in the early 1960s and spanned seven decades and over 150 features to the present, with his final performance coming in last year's Western series Lawmen: Bass Reeves. His CV includes classics across several genres, including the 1970 anti-war satire MASH, the 1973 thriller Don't Look Now and his more recent appearances in The Hunger Games. At 6ft 4, he was a towering presence on screen and cast a lengthy shadow.\n\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born in the Canadian east coast seaport of Saint John, New Brunswick on July 17, 1935. His parents were Dorothy and Frederick, who ran the local gas, electricity and bus company. His first word, he once told Esquire, was \"neck\". \"My mother turned around and said, 'What did he say?'\" Sutherland recalled. \"My sister said, 'He said, neck.' My neck was killing me. That was a sign of polio. One leg's a little shorter, but I survived.\" Keen to get involved in the entertainment business, his first job at the age of 14 was working as a DJ for local radio station CKBW.\n\nBy 1952, Sutherland was attending the University of Toronto, where he became a valued member of the UC Follies comedy troupe. He graduated in 1956 with a double major in engineering and drama, but it was clear which half of his degree had excited him most when he moved to the United Kingdom to continue his acting studies at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. He married his first wife, Lois May Hardwick, in 1959 and the marriage lasted seven years.\n\nSutherland started his career in the theatre and had a handful of minor roles on British television before landing his first film role, playing both a young soldier and an old hag in the 1964 Italian horror The Castle of the Living Dead. Sutherland was so appreciative of the break that in 1966 he named his first son after the producer who hired him, Warren Kiefer.\n\nIn 1967, Sutherland became a Hollywood name following the release of Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen, where Sutherland played a killer opposite Lee Marvin and John Cassavetes. Sutherland told The Guardian in 2005 that he originally had one line in the film until Clint Walker refused to play a scene requiring him to impersonate a general. According to Sutherland, Aldrich, who didn't know his name, turned to him and said, \"You! With the big ears! You do it!\"\n\nThree years later, his star rose still further with appearances in the Gene Wilder comedy Start the Revolution Without Me, and two more war films: Kelly's Heroes, playing the aptly named Sergeant Oddball, and as subversive surgeon \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in Robert Altman's hugely successful counter-culture farce MASH.\n\nSutherland used his rising profile to become a prominent anti-war activist, which made him a target for the US establishment. In 2022, Kiefer Sutherland told The Independent: \"Because of my father's politics, they felt he was a Social Democrat, a socialist, who believed in nationalised health care and large government, and those were not necessarily 'American values'.\"\n\nSutherland's second wife, Shirley Douglas, was also a high-profile campaigner. The daughter of Tommy Douglas, a socialist politician who was the architect of Canada's welfare state, Douglas was both an actor and a civil rights activist who was one of the founders of the fundraising group Friends of the Black Panthers. Documents declassified in 2017 showed that at the CIA's request, Donald Sutherland was placed on an NSA watch-list in the early 1970s.\n\nHe didn't let this unwanted attention deter him from speaking out. In 1971, Sutherland starred in Alan Pakula's thriller Klute opposite Jane Fonda, a fellow anti-war protestor with whom he had a two-year affair as his marriage to Douglas fell apart. In 1972, he co-wrote and co-produced an explosive anti-Vietnam War documentary F.T.A., working with Fonda once again.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Sutherland starred in a string of films that each broke the mold in different ways. He starred alongside Julie Christie in Nicolas Roeg's chilling horror thriller Don't Look Now in 1973, a film that became as known for an explicit, emotionally tangled sex scene between Sutherland and Christie as it was for its sinister narrative.\n\nIn 2002, Roeg told The Independent that the scene had been inspired by a friend who had lost a child. \"They'd been told to try for another,\" recalled Roeg. \"That very often happens. And we [Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie] talked about that. I think that's why people have made so much of what is usually called the 'love scene' in the movie. Most love scenes are seduction scenes... But these two are in love. They have kids and they're happily married. And this awful thing happens to them, and it's more than they can bear.\"\n\nSutherland went on to work with the great Italian directors Bernardo Bertolucci (playing a Fascist in 1976's 1900) and Federico Fellini (1976's a made-up Lothario in Casanova), but also found time to play a dope-smoking college professor in John Landis's college comedy Animal House in 1978. The same year, he starred in Philip Kaufman's sci-fi horror Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In 1980, Sutherland won widespread acclaim for his portrayal of the long-suffering patriarch in Robert Redford's Oscar-winning Ordinary People, starring opposite Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton. Throughout the 1990s he had a pivotal role in Oliver Stone's provocative JFK (1991) and played a Van Helsing-type hunter in the original film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992). In 1995 he won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his work in the TV movie Citizen X (1995).\n\nFrom 2012, Sutherland became known to a new generation of fans President Snow, the main antagonist of The Hunger Games franchise. He appeared in a total of four films in the franchise, winning plaudits once again. Whether playing a villain, a hero, or an oddball combination of both, Sutherland was able to combine charm with menace in a way few actors can.\n\nIn 2015, at the age of 80, he told the BBC while promoting The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 that he was determined to keep working right to the end. \"It's a passionate endeavor,\" said Sutherland. \"Retirement for actors is spelt 'DEATH'.\"",

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday. No further details were immediately available.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nBorn in St. John, New Brunswick, Donald McNichol Sutherland was the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher. Raised in Nova Scotia, he was a disc jockey with his own radio station at the age of 14.\n\n\"When I was 13 or 14, I really thought everything I felt was wrong and dangerous, and that God was going to kill me for it,\" Sutherland told The New York Times in 1981. \"My father always said, 'Keep your mouth shut, Donnie, and maybe people will think you have character.'\"\n\nSutherland began as an engineering student at the University of Toronto but switched to English and started acting in school theatrical productions. While studying in Toronto, he met Lois Hardwick, an aspiring actress. They married in 1959, but divorced seven years later.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, Sutherland attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts to study acting. Sutherland began appearing in West End plays and British television. After a move to Los Angeles, he continued to bounce around until a series of war films changed his trajectory.\n\nHis first American film was \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopathic. 1970 saw the release of both the World War II yarn \"Kelly's Heroes\" and \"M.A.S.H.,\" an acclaimed smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nIf Sutherland had had his way, Altman would have been fired from \"M.A.S.H.\" He and co-star Elliott Gould were unhappy with the director's unorthodox, improvisational style and fought to have him replaced. But the film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message. Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theater Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford. For a career launched by \"M.A.S.H.\" it was a fitting, if ironic bookend.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [],

enduring legacy of playing both heroes and villains", "body": "Sutherland featured in The Hunger Games film franchise as dictator president Coriolanus Snow.\n\nCanadian actor Donald Sutherland has died aged 88 following \"a long illness\", his agent confirmed to the PA news agency.\n\nHe rose to fame after starring in films such as The Dirty Dozen (1967) and Kelly's Heroes (1970).\n\nHe is perhaps best known as the womanising Captain Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr in the 1970 film version of M*A*S*H, and would eventually becoming a leading campaigner against war.\n\nMore recently, Sutherland featured in The Hunger Games film franchise as dictator president Coriolanus Snow, and as a judge in the 2023 TV show, Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\n\nThe actor had infantile paralysis and rheumatic fever before almost dying from spinal meningitis as a child.\n\nAfter graduating from university, he moved to Britain to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda), and began to land small roles in British films and TV shows.\n\nIn 1967, following a second appearance alongside Roger Moore in The Saint, Sutherland was handed the role of Vernon L Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen - a box office hit.\n\nHis later films included The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), The First Great Train Robbery (1978) and JFK (1991).\n\nSutherland won a Golden Globe along with an Emmy Award for the mini-series Citizen X (1995), and another gong for the television movie Path To War (2002).\n\nSutherland's son, Kiefer, called his father \"one of the most important actors in the history of film\" following his death.\n\nIn 2019, Kiefer said he broke down in tears after discovering his father's acting work.\n\nThe actor said he was unaware of his father's career, and the \"extraordinary\" work he had done until he was old enough to watch his films.\n\nEqually adept at playing heroes and villains, Sutherland portrayed President Snow, the main antagonist of The Hunger Games film franchise, beginning in 2012.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Sutherland would receive an Honorary Oscar, from the Academy.\n\nSutherland was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1978, promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2019.\n\nSutherland was about to publish his memoir, Made Up, But Still True, later this year, which was set to explore \"an unfiltered account of his memories of his life\" from how life-changing a role M*A*S*H had been along with \"his far too many brushes with death\".\n\nSutherland married three times.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Francine Racette, and five children, including actors Kiefer, Rossif and Angus.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com",

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nA prolific actor who appeared in more than 190 films and TV shows, Sutherland embodied an off-kilter appeal that served him brilliantly in a series of classic 1970s movies, which gradually evolved into a veteran gravitas in the latter stages of his career.\n\nHe did not win a major award for any of his film roles (and was never nominated for a conventional Oscar), but did win two Golden Globes for best supporting actor for the TV movies Citizen X (in 1996) and Path to War (in 2003). Sutherland received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nBorn in Canada in 1935, Sutherland studied engineering and drama at the University of Toronto, and opted to move to London in 1957 to join an acting class at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda).\n\nAfter a series of small roles on British TV shows including Man of the World, The Saint and The Avengers, and films such as the Hammer horror film Fanatic and the Amicus anthology Dr Terror's House of Horrors, Sutherland was cast in the action film The Dirty Dozen, as one of a group of prisoners trained up for a dangerous mission during the second world war.\n\nThe Dirty Dozen was a hit and Sutherland then appeared in two more war films with anti-heroic sensibilities: the massively influential Korean War comedy M*A*S*H, in which Sutherland played rule-bending surgeon \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, and Kelly's Heroes, as a whacked-out tank commander who joins Clint Eastwood's bank robbery.\n\nWhile working on the latter film, in 1968, Sutherland said he \"died for a few seconds\" as a result of contracting meningitis.\n\nSutherland's work became more radical: he played the title role in Klute, opposite Jane Fonda's sex worker, as a detective investigating a murder in the first of director Alan J Pakula's so-called \"paranoia trilogy\" and appeared with Fonda in the anti-Vietnam War documentary FTA.\n\nIn 2017, declassified documents showed that Sutherland, a vocal anti-war activist, was on the National Security Agency's \"watch list\" between 1971 and 1973.\n\nSutherland then embarked on a wide variety of roles as he attained leading man status.\n\nIn 1973 he starred opposite Julie Christie in Don't Look Now, the Nicolas Roeg-directed psychological horror, which contained a then-infamous sex scene, intercut with Christie and Sutherland getting dressed, which Sutherland was repeatedly forced to deny was authentic.\n\nHe then starred in Federico Fellini's Casanova, played murderous fascist Attila Melanchini in Bernardo Bertolucci's epic 1900, and featured alongside Michael Caine as a duplicitous IRA man in war thriller The Eagle Has Landed.\n\nHe played a dope-smoking professor in National Lampoon's Animal House, and fought \"pod people\" in a remake of the horror sci-fi Invasion of the Body Snatchers - giving rise to a popular gif of the film's final moments.\n\nIn 1980 he led an impressive ensemble cast in Robert Redford's directorial debut, Ordinary People, after Gene Hackman had dropped out of the role.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s Sutherland was mostly cast in character roles, including an art dealer in Six Degrees of Separation, the mysterious Mr \"X\" in Oliver Stone's JFK who suggests there is a high-level coup inside the US government, and slayer trainer Merrick Jamison-Smythe in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie starring Kristy Swanson.\n\nSutherland also had prominent roles in the legal thriller A Time to Kill (alongside his son Kiefer), the astronaut drama Space Cowboys and the Jane Austen adaptation Pride & Prejudice.\n\nIn 2012 his role as the villainous President Snow in The Hunger Games introduced him to a new generation of filmgoers. He also starred in Stephen King horror Mr Harrigan's Phone and disaster thriller Moonfall in 2022.\n\nMost recently, he had a recurring role in TV series Lawmen: Bass Reeves with David Oyelowo.\n\nSutherland was married three times, to Lois Hardwick between 1959 and 1966, Shirley Douglas (1966-1970) and Francine Racette, whom he married in 1972. - Guardian", "source": {"uri":

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nHelen Mirren paid tribute to Sutherland in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, \"Donald Sutherland was one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain, and a great knowledge on a wide variety of subjects.\"\n\nShe added, \"He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became. He was my colleague and became my friend. I will miss his presence in this world.\"\n\nJames Dreyfus, known for his role as Constable Kevin Goody in \"The Thin Blue Line,\" paid tribute to the late actor in an X post.\n\n\"This actor! This AMAZING actor. A staple in my life through incredible performances 'Ordinary People,' 'Don't Look Now,' 'Klute,' 'Die! Die! My Darling!,' Invasion of The Body Snatchers,' etc etc,\" he wrote. \"Quirky, versatile, always honest & brilliant. Wonderful. RIP Donald Sutherland.\"\n\nTurner Classic Movies also released a statement. \"We are deeply saddened to hear the loss of actor & activist Donald Sutherland,\" the company wrote. \"A versatile performer with unforgettable characters, his contributions across genres and generations will continue to inspire storytellers of all ages.\"\n\nActor Ben Stiller responded to Kiefer's statement, writing, \"Sending love and so much respect.\"\n\nActress Kristy Swanson shared, \"My heart is with you Kiefer. He was and will always be a beautiful man. May he rest in peace and love.\"\n\nHenry Winkler, known for his role in \"Happy Days,\" wrote, \"Stacey and I send you our deepest sympathies .. Your dad was indeed singular . Warmly , Henry.\"\n\nActor and filmmaker Edgar Wright shared a lengthy statement on X, paying tribute to the late actor.\n\n\"RIP the great Donald Sutherland, a favorite actor and always fascinating screen presence,\" he began. \"He starred in two of my very favorite and most influential films - 'Don't Look Now' and the 1978 'Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers.' But that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography.\"\n\n\"A funny, laconic, but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his break-through in 'The Dirty Dozen', and then on an incredible run in the 70's, 80's and beyond with 'M*A*S*H', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Little Murders', 'Klute', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Day Of The Locust', 'Ordinary People' and 'JFK', among many others,\" Wright added.\n\n\"I even adore his very early appearances in 'Dr. Terror's House Of Horrors' and 'The World Ten Times Over', as well as his very silly cameo in 'Kentucky Fried Movie'. I know many of you following me will feel the same way about this great screen legend's passing, so please list your favorite Donald Sutherland films.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"So sorry to see you go Donald, but what a legacy you leave behind.\"\n\nRon Howard, director of \"Backdraft,\" expressed how talented Donald Sutherland was and what an honor it was to work alongside the actor.\n\n\"I was blessed to direct him in 'Backdraft,'\" Howard said after hearing the news. \"One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\n\n\"He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nTall and known for his intensity on screen, Sutherland earned an Emmy for his role as a Soviet official in the fact-based HBO movie Citizen X, as well as a pair of Golden Globes.\n\nHis career spanned more than 50 years and 140 film credits, including recent roles in the limited series Trust as oil tycoon J Paul Getty and HBO's The Undoing.\n\nSutherland's big break came when he was cast as one of The Dirty Dozen in the star-studded 1967 film, which became a major hit.\n\nHe followed that with another war movie, Kelly's Heroes, before playing the wisecracking doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the movie version of M*A*S*H and opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a high-class \"call girl\" in the crime mystery Klute.\n\nFonda and Sutherland also had an off-screen relationship around the time that they made the film.\n\nReflecting his ability to play all sorts of roles, Sutherland's 1970s resume included a chillingly effective remake of the horror film Invasion of the Body Snatchers and a memorable turn as a pot-smoking professor in the National Lampoon comedy Animal House.\n\nHe also starred opposite Julie Christie in director Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, a 1973 movie that became somewhat notorious for the raciness of its sex scene, which had to be trimmed in order to avoid an X rating.\n\nA steady stream of roles followed in a wide variety of genres, from a small but pivotal part in Oliver Stone's JFK to supporting work in Ordinary People - which won the Oscar for best picture - Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Backdraft and The Italian Job.\n\nSutherland also starred as the legendary lover for director Federico Fellini in Fellini's Casanova. Many younger filmgoers, meanwhile, will likely remember him as the evil president in The Hunger Games movies.\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland endured several bouts of ill health as a child, including polio. He attended the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering before gravitating toward drama and appearing on stage, graduating with degrees in both.\n\nThe 193-centimetre actor met his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in college, and the two married in 1959. He moved to London, where he found some stage work, and eventually to Hollywood in the 1960s, where Dirty Dozen and M*A*S*H put him on the map.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he divorced, marrying actress Shirley Douglas, whom he met while filming the horror movie Castle of the Living Dead.\n\nThey had two children, actor Kiefer and Rachel, who also works in film as a post-production supervisor. That marriage also ended in divorce, and in 1972 Sutherland wed his third wife, actress Francine Racette, with whom he had three sons.\n\nIn a 2020 conversation with The Undoing costar Hugh Grant for Interview magazine, Sutherland said that he was always so nervous when a movie began shooting that he threw up the night before. He also discussed subtly altering his dialogue, as he put it, to \"try to make the lines that I've been given fit my mouth\".\n\nSutherland appeared in three films with son Kiefer, beginning with the 24 star's small part in the comedy-drama Max Dugan Returns in 1983, followed by the John Grisham adaptation A Time to Kill. The two didn't perform in a scene together, however, until the 2016 western Forsaken.\n\n\"It was a memory and an experience that I will treasure for the rest of my life,\" Kiefer Sutherland told Good Morning America at the time, saying he spent years looking for something that the two could do together.\n\nIn 2019, Reuters asked Sutherland what advice he would give young actors.\n\n\"Try and be as truthful as you possibly can, read, read a lot, learn, memorise things, enjoy your artistry, study dancing, be a circus performer, learn how to juggle, so many things, but mostly you have to observe,\" he responded.\n\nSutherland received an honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board in 2017 and was honored with the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 2022, Sutherland appeared alongside Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson in the space thriller Moonfall and in the Roku TV mini series Swimming with Sharks.", "source": {"uri": "celebrity.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "celebrity.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Undoing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Getty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Confirming his death, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, paid a moving tribute.\n\nHe said: \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"No details of his illness were given.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Donald Sutherland's marriage as 'dumb mistakes' led him to wife Francine\n\nSutherland never retired and worked regularly up until his death.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" he said in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom - time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nA major figure in the New Hollywood of the 1970s who had worked steadily since, Sutherland was long considered among the best actors never to have been nominated for an Academy Award, despite appearing in several films that won the biggest of them.\n\nHe was bestowed with an honourary Oscar in 2017. He also has an Emmy and two Golden Globes. Tall at 6ft 4in with shock white hair and dropping piercing blue eyes, he was difficult to miss whether he played a zany oddball, an icy tyrant or a sadistic villain.\n\nHe often recalled that while growing up in eastern Canada, he once asked his mother if he was good-looking, only to be told, \"No, but your face has a lot of character.\"\n\nHe recounted how he was once rejected for a film role by a producer who said: \"This part calls for a guy-next-door type. You don't look like you've lived next door to anyone.\"\n\nHowever, it failed to stop Sutherland from finding global success, seeing him star in nearly 200 film or television roles.\n\nBorn in Saint John, a small fishing village in New Brunswick, Canada, he barely survived a series of childhood diseases, including infantile paralysis, rheumatoid fever and spinal meningitis. He said the town had only 5,000 residents, and \"that was when the train rolled into town.\"\n\nOne of four children, his mother Dorothy was a mathematician and his father Frederick was a salesman. From an early age, Sutherland displayed a keen interest in acting, a passion that would guide him throughout his life.\n\nHe attended Victoria University, an affiliated college of the University of Toronto, where he initially studied engineering but later switched to drama. His love of acting began in a Nova Scotia movie theatre when he was a teen, but his film aspirations seemed too lofty a pursuit, so he tried his luck in theatre instead.\n\n\"It's not that theatre was my first love. My first love was just to be an actor,\" he said.\n\n\"I was kind of dumb and cowish, and I didn't think movies were something I could ever be part of. I don't know why I presumed that the theatre would be. It was more ordinary, I suppose.\"\n\nHis academic journey took him to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 1956, but he dropped out after nine months because he disliked its psychological approach to acting.\n\nHe went on to tour with various repertory companies and appeared in several BBC television productions, including bit parts in The Saint and The Avengers.\n\nIn 1966, Sutherland married Shirley Douglas, with whom he had two children before they divorced - twins Rachel, a production manager, and Stand By Me star Kiefer. Sutherland broke through in Hollywood with a small role in the 1967 Second World War classic The Dirty Dozen using a clip of his appearance on The Saint to land a role.\n\n\"I was a glorified extra in The Dirty Dozen,\" Sutherland once said. \"They hired legitimate actors to play the bottom six of the dozen.\"\n\nHis breakthrough came in 1970 with Robert Altman's satirical war film, M.A.S.H., where he portrayed the cocky surgeon Captain \"Hawkeye\" Pierce.\n\nThe film caught on beyond anyone's expectations and Sutherland identified personally with its anti-war message.Outspoken against the Vietnam War, Sutherland, actress Jane Fonda and others founded the Free Theatre Associates in 1971. Banned by the Army because of their political views, they performed in venues near military bases in Southeast Asia in 1973.\n\nAfter then playing neurotic platoon commander Oddball in Kelly's Heroes, the roles catapulted Sutherland to international fame.They established him as a leading man capable of comedic and dramatic performances.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, he continued to build an impressive body of work. His role as the chilling, emotionless hitman in Klute, in which he starred opposite Fonda, showcased his range and depth as an actor. Two years later, in Don't Look Now, the actor delivered a haunting performance that remains one of the most critically acclaimed of his career.\n\nHis portrayal of the benevolent yet enigmatic John Baxter in Nicolas Roeg's supernatural thriller is often cited as a masterclass in subtle, understated acting. From the dystopian sci-fi classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1978 to his role as the authoritarian fascist in 1900 and his comedic turn in Animal House, Sutherland continually defied typecasting.\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down - but still eccentric - parts in Robert Redford's Ordinary People and Oliver Stone's JFK. His ability to embody such a wide array of characters made him one of his generation's most respected and sought-after actors.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the star continued to deliver memorable performances in both film and television. More lately, his role as the ruthless President Snow in The Hunger Games series introduced him to a new generation of fans. He brought complexity to the character, transforming what could have been a one-dimensional villain into a nuanced and formidable antagonist.\n\nSutherland's work in television was equally impressive. His portrayal of the enigmatic Mr X in the hit series The X-Files and his Emmy-winning performance in the HBO film Citizen X demonstrated his enduring appeal and adaptability.\n\n\"It's characters who make pictures,\" he said in 1995. \"Essentially my job is to provide information about them.\"\n\nDespite his lengthy career, Sutherland had a dearth of accolades, winning but a few major acting awards for his performances - an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the 1995 miniseries Citizen X and another Globe for 2002's Path to War. But the lack of awards didn't trouble him.\n\nHe recalled: \"My career has been all downhill since the age of 11. I did my first play, The Male Animal, at Toronto University's Hart House Theatre.\n\n\"The audience laughed and applauded when I came on, they applauded when I went off, and they applauded when I came on again. I've never had it as good since.\"\n\nWithin minutes of the news of his death, tributes began to pour in.\n\nHollywood director Ron Howard wrote: \"I was blessed to direct him in Backdraft. One of the most intelligent, interesting ad engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage and dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nPiers Morgan added: \"One of my all-time favourite actors who played so many great roles. What a sad loss.\"\n\nBeyond his acting, Sutherland was devoted to his family. He married his first wife, Lois Hardwick, in 1959, but the marriage ended in divorce. After wedding Shirley Douglas, the daughter of Canadian political icon Tommy Douglas, the couple had two twins Rachel and Kiefer, before their divorce in 1970. Sutherland married Francine Racette in 1972, and they had three sons: Roeg, Rossif, and Angus.\n\nHis children have followed in his footsteps, making their own marks in the entertainment industry, particularly Kiefer, who has achieved global fame with his roles.\n\nSutherland's dedication to acting was matched by his commitment to various philanthropic endeavours. He was a vocal advocate for numerous causes, including environmental conservation, human rights, and healthcare reform.\n\nThroughout his career, numerous awards and honours recognised his contributions to the arts and his support for emerging talent. Despite his star status and career demands, Sutherland remained humble. He was known for his humility, warmth, and wit, which endeared him to colleagues and fans alike.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer and daughter Rachel. The star had four grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_bucktin@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Christopher Bucktin",

rumour Sutherland later discounted.\n\nThe 1970s also saw him play an IRA member in The Eagle Has Landed, a pot-smoking college professor in National Lampoon's Animal House, and the lead in the 1978

in such series as Dirty Sexy Money and Commander-in-Chief.\n\nSutherland has four sons and one daughter.\n\nDespite his numerous roles, the Canadian actor was never nominated for an Oscar but did

He was 88.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" actor Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nThe elder Sutherland had a distinctive look -- and piercing eyes -- that brought a depth and mystery to the huge range of roles he inhabited over more than half a century on the big screen.\n\nOne of Canada's most famous sons, he played dashing leading men as well as antiheroes and villains, most recently making a name among a new generation of fans as the evil President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" wrote Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nReaction to the Emmy and Golden Globe-winner's death was swift, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailing his unique talents.\n\n\"I had the opportunity when I was much younger to meet Donald Sutherland, and even as a young man who hadn't had a full exposure to the depth of brilliance of Donald Sutherland, I was deeply, deeply star struck,\" he told a press conference.\n\n\"He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly, truly, a great Canadian artist, and he will be deeply missed.\"\n\nAfter what he himself termed a \"meandering\" start to his acting career, Donald Sutherland came to prominence in Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen,\" where 12 convicts are tasked with carrying out what appears to be a suicide mission in occupied France.\n\nMore from this section Diplomats say at least 550 pilgrims died during hajj, mostly Egyptians Rural county in northern Alberta opens nurse practitioner clinic Another Study Finds CRISPR Gene Therapy Fights Sickle Cell\n\nStarring alongside luminaries such as Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas, Sutherland's impish charms caught the attention of producers of \"M*A*S*H.\"\n\nThough set in the Korean War, the 1970 film was widely seen as a sophisticated satire on the Vietnam War.\n\nHis casting opposite Elliott Gould turned Sutherland into a household name in 1970s America, and opened the door to a durable career that would see him work with some of the biggest names in show business.\n\nThey included Jane Fonda, with whom he starred in 1971's \"Klute,\" in which he played a detective who falls for the call girl he is supposed to be protecting.\n\nFonda won an Oscar for her performance, which she credited to her intense feelings for Sutherland, with whom she was in a relationship at the time.\n\nTheir off-screen chemistry brought Sutherland into her pacifist orbit, and he became active in anti-Vietnam War circles.\n\nThe pair put together a travelling revue, which irked the US government and landed them both under FBI surveillance.\n\nhg/des", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005).\n\nIn the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 88.\n\n\"He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that,\" his son Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X. \"A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland's often cynical, subversive presence had been a mainstay in American cinema for seven decades. During his long career, which kicked off during the Vietnam War, he acted alongside dozens of Oscar winners. But Sutherland himself was never nominated for one, although the Academy presented him with an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all the characters I've played,\" Sutherland said during his acceptance speech. \"Thank them for using their lives to inform my lives.\"\n\nAt first, the Canadian actor spent a lot of time playing American soldiers. In his breakout role, in 1967's The Dirty Dozen, Sutherland played a convict turned soldier sent on a suicide mission ahead of Operation D-Day.\n\nImpressed by his performance, director Robert Aldrich cast Sutherland in the 1970 film M*A*S*H, where he played wisecracking combat surgeon Hawkeye. That same year, Sutherland played a rogue tank commander named Oddball in the movie Kelly's Heroes. All of these movies were released as the Vietnam War raged in the background.\n\nDespite playing so many soldiers, Sutherland was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. In 1971, He performed in a traveling roadshow opposite Jane Fonda in front of U.S. military soldiers. It was a leftist response to Bob Hope's pro-war USO tour.\n\nThe show consisted of skits, songs and interviews with soldiers. It was made into a documentary, F.T.A., in 1972.\n\nSutherland and Fonda, who were in the midst of an affair at the time, were put on National Security Agency watchlists for two years because of their anti-war activities.\n\nSutherland's political activities did not adversely affect his career. He ascended to leading roles, including as a sullen police officer in Klute, an aspiring artist in The Day of the Locust, and grieving fathers in Ordinary People and Don't Look Now.\n\nSutherland was probably most well known for his portrayal of off-kilter authority figures; over the years, he played doctors, sadistic prison wardens, and paranoid government figures, as in Oliver Stone's film JFK. A new generation of fans, including actress Jennifer Lawrence, embraced his bone-chilling portrayal of the tyrannical President Snow in The Hunger Games film franchise.\n\n\"Donald is the most committed, professional, kind person I have ever met,\" Lawrence said at the 2017 Governers Awards that gave Sutherland his honorary Oscar.\n\nSutherland's children followed in his footsteps, including his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland. The elusive Oscar aside, he won other awards, including Emmy and Golden Globe awards, but Donald Sutherland's subtle, dry performances went beyond easy approbation. They made audiences amused and uncomfortable, exactly as intended.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mansee_khurana@npr.org", "name": "Mansee Khurana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakthrough role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Service_Organizations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Service Organizations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aldrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Aldrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Hope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Locust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Day of the Locust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_warden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison warden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

A life well lived.\"\n\nThrough a career spanning over seven decades, Sutherland will be remembered as one of entertainment's most versatile and respected actors -- and one of the best to have never received an Academy Award.\n\nIn 2017, however, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded him an Honorary Oscar \"for a lifetime of indelible characters, rendered with unwavering truthfulness.\"\n\nHis other accolades include a Supporting Actor Emmy for HBO's \"Citizen X,\" a Golden Globe for the same role, a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe for HBO's \"Path to War,\" seven other Golden Globe nominations and another Emmy nomination.\n\nLast year, Canada Post issued a stamp in Sutherland's honor. Other honors the legend racked up in his career included stars on the Canadian and Hollywood Walks of Fame and being made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nBeyond the trophies though, Sutherland's work speaks for itself. He often appeared in multiple titles annually, playing everything from the villain President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise to a hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes,\" an ex-con hoping to be a demolition derby driver in \"Steelyard Blues\" to a caring father in a grieving family in \"Ordinary People,\" and an an anti-authoritarian Army medic in \"MASH\" -- a leading role that turned him into a major star in 1970.\n\nOther works on his impressive resume include \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"JFK,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"The Day of the Locust,\" \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Human Trafficking,\" \"Space Cowboys,\" \"Man on the Train,\" \"Horrible Bosses,\" \"The Undoing,\" and most recently last year, \"Miranda's Victim\" and \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife since 1972 Francine Racette, his daughter, Hollywood production manager Rachel Sutherland, his four sons -- Emmy-winning \"Designated Survivor\" actor Kiefer Sutherland, actor Rossif Sutherland, producer Angus Sutherland, and CAA executive Roeg Sutherland -- and four grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "kgun9.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A life well-lived, indeed.\"\n\nThe announcement prompted a deluge of condolences and tributes in honor of Donald Sutherland.\n\nActor Cary Elwes expressed his sorrow on Instagram.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy for you,\" he penned in a comment to Kiefer. \"Immensely grateful for the privilege of knowing and collaborating with him. Sending our love.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged Sutherland's passing during a press conference in Westville, N.S., reminiscing about feeling \"profoundly, profoundly starstruck\" upon their first meeting.\n\n\"My thoughts are with Kiefer and the entire Sutherland family, as well as with all Canadians who, like myself, are deeply saddened by this news,\" he stated.\n\n\"He possessed a formidable presence, a brilliance in his craft, and was truly an extraordinary Canadian artist,\" he added.\n\nRon Howard, who directed Sutherland in the 1991 action film \"Backdraft,\" paid homage to Sutherland on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"One of the most intelligent, intriguing, and captivating film actors of all time,\" he wrote. \"Incredible range, creative bravery, and unwavering dedication to the narrative and the audience.\"\n\nSutherland's oeuvre encompassed nearly 200 credits, including iconic films like \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"MAS*H,\" and \"Klute.\"\n\nHailing from New Brunswick, Canada, Sutherland began his career as a radio news reporter before venturing to London in 1957 to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nHe subsequently secured minor roles in British film and television.\n\nHis initial cinematic forays often revolved around military themes. He featured in \"The Dirty Dozen,\" a 1967 World War II action film, and in the 1970 film \"MAS*H,\" depicting medics during the Korean War.\n\nJane Fonda co-starred with Sutherland in Alan J. Pakula's 1971 thriller \"Klute,\" where he portrayed a detective aided by a high-priced call girl in his search for a missing person.\n\nSutherland and Fonda were romantically involved for two years before parting ways.\n\nThe 1970s also saw him embodying an IRA operative in \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" a cannabis-enthusiast professor in \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" and the protagonist in the 1978 remake of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Sutherland depicted the father of a suicidal adolescent in the Academy Award-winning \"Ordinary People.\"\n\nHis career transitioned to television in the 2000s, with appearances in series such as \"Dirty Sexy Money\" and \"Commander-in-Chief.\"\n\nDespite his prolific career, the Canadian actor never received an Oscar nomination, though he was honored with an honorary Academy Award in 2017.\n\nSutherland was renowned for his political activism, notably protesting the US war in Vietnam alongside Fonda. Their efforts were documented in the 1972 film \"F.T.A.\"\n\nSutherland infused his roles with his convictions, including his portrayal of the despotic President Snow in \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,\" released in 2015. In this film, Sutherland's character becomes the target of heroine Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who aims to overthrow the oppressive regime.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with BBC News, Sutherland expressed his hope that the film's socio-political message would awaken young viewers to global realities. In the narrative, Panem is depicted as a society where an elite minority subjugates the impoverished majority.\n\n\"I have believed for the past 30 years that the younger generation lacked political awareness,\" Sutherland remarked. \"Our collective aim was to engage them. As Bruce Springsteen said, 'Blind faith in your leaders... will get you killed.'\"\n\nSutherland's demise precedes the upcoming November release of his memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" chronicling his personal journey as an actor.\n\nIn his 2015 BBC News interview, Sutherland noted a significant shift in the industry, observing that contemporary actors are amassing substantial wealth.\n\n\"I don't think any of my contemporaries became actors for financial gain.

Generations of movie and TV fans have known Donald Sutherland from an eclectic mix of films and television series, playing roles ranging from tortured leading men to sardonic pot smokers. Sadly, Sutherland died on Thursday at the age of 88. His passing was confirmed by Deadline; no cause of death was given.\n\nThe Canadian-born Sutherland studied drama in England, and made his earliest screen appearances in BBC and Hammer productions. His Hollywood breakthrough was his role in The Dirty Dozen, the Lee Marvin-led war film about a group of convicts recruited for a suicide mission during World War II.\n\nA few years after The Dirty Dozen, Sutherland starred in Robert Altman's MASH, one of the defining films of the early 1970s. This war film was a satire; set during the Korean War, it was intended as a spoof of the Vietnam War and military policy of the time, with Sutherland starring as Hawkeye Pierce, the latest addition to the team of doctors in an overworked and very rowdy MASH unit. The film was a massive hit, and spawned an even more popular TV series (although there Hawkeye was played by Alan Alda).\n\nMASH made Sutherland an instant star, and he continued to make big movies all through the 1970s, including the hit thriller Klute, the cult classic horror film Don't Look Now, and the superb remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nThat same year, Sutherland had a small but very memorable role in another era-defining hit: 1978's National Lampoon's Animal House. There Sutherland played a hippie college professor who introduced some of his students to drugs.\n\nREAD MORE: 10 '70s Classics That Could Never Get Made Today\n\nYounger movie fans probably know Sutherland best as the evil President Snow from The Hunger Games franchise.\n\nIf we attempted to list all of Sutherland's memorable performances, we would be here forever. A few of the other highlights include Kelly's Heroes, The Day of the Locust, Ordinary People, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, JFK, Outbreak, A Time to Kill, The Italian Job.\n\nOn television he starred on countless TV movies, and was a member of the casts of shows like Dirty Sexy Money, Commander in Chief, and Crossing Lines. And, of course, Sutherland is also well-known as the father of fellow actor Kiefer Sutherland as well.\n\nSutherland's body of work is enormous; it's hard to imagine that anyone reading this doesn't know him from sight or by from the sound of his smooth voice, which he used to such great effect in films like The Hunger Games franchise. Remarkably, Sutherland never received an Oscar nomination in his entire career, despite all those acclaimed (and often award-winning) movies he starred in. He did receive an honorary award from the Academy in 2017.\n\nThat feels like an impossible oversight; he surely is one of the best actors in history never to even be nominated for an Oscar. But proper Academy Award recognition or not, the work he did will surely endure for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "mix108.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MIX 108"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_singer@mix108.com", "name": "Matt Singer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "War film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Alda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hippie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

A life well lived.\"\n\nDuring his esteemed career, Sutherland won a Golden Globe for the TV movie Path To War for playing presidential adviser Clark Clifford and another gong along with an Emmy Award for the the mini-series Citizen X.\n\nIn 2017, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his acting but failed to get an Oscar nod during his lengthy career.\n\nSutherland's most recent roles included The Hunger Games film franchise, playing dictator president Coriolanus Snow, and as a judge in the 2023 TV show Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\n\nHe also had roles in thriller The Mechanic, Roman epic The Eagle, war film The Dirty Dozen, satire The Day Of The Locust, horror Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, period drama Pride & Prejudice and drama Space Cowboys.\n\nSutherland is perhaps best known as the womanising Captain Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr in the 1970 film version of M*A*S*H, and would eventually become a leading campaigner against war.\n\nIn 2012, he became a Commander of the Arts in France and was praised by the French culture minister Frederic Mitterrand for his \"extraordinary\" career.\n\nSutherland was about to publish his memoir Made Up, But Still True, later this year, which was set to explore \"an unfiltered account of his memories of his life\" from how life-changing a role M*A*S*H had been along with \"his far too many brushes with death\".\n\nThe actor had infantile paralysis and rheumatic fever before almost dying from spinal meningitis as a child, and later left Canada for the UK to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda).\n\nSutherland's early roles in the 1960s included European and UK productions such as Castle Of The Living Dead, which starred Christopher Lee, and Fanatic with Tallulah Bankhead, before he was cast in The Dirty Dozen as one of the American convicts sent on a secret mission as part of the D-Day landings in the Second World War.\n\nA statement from CAA said: \"Acclaimed actor Donald Sutherland died today in Miami, Florida after a long illness. He was 88 years old.\"\n\nIt also said: \"Sutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren.\n\n\"A private celebration of life will be held by the family.\"\n\nSutherland's son Roeg is an executive at the talent agency CAA, and his sons Rossif and Angus have also worked as actors.", "source": {"uri":

Donald Sutherland, the acclaimed Canadian actor with decades worth of roles and awards to his name, has died at age 88, Deadline reports. He is survived by his wife Francine Racette, who he'd been with since 1972. Sutherland had been married twice before meeting Racette, first to Lois Hardwick from 1959 to 1966 and then to the late Shirley Douglas from 1966 to 1970.\n\nSutherland also leaves behind five children: Kiefer (\"24\"), Rachel, Rossif (\"Three Pines\"), Angus (\"1917\"), and Roeg. All of Sutherland's children followed him into the entertainment business: Kiefer, Rossif, and Angus are actors (as is Kiefer's own daughter, Sarah), Rachel is a production manager, and Roeg is a talent agent.\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick on July 17, 1935, Sutherland had a middle-class upbringing -- his father Frederick was a salesman and his mother Dorothy was a teacher. However, he was also a sickly child, suffering at different points from polio, rheumatic fever, hepatitis, pneumonia, and scarlet fever. None were able to keep him down, though. He went on to study Engineering and Drama at Victoria University in Toronto, graduating in 1956. Choosing his passion over a steady career choice, he continued to study acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nAfter a string of small-time work during the 1960s, Sutherland broke out after appearing in 1967's \"The Dirty Dozen\" and his career never looked back. Honors to his name include stars on both Hollywood's and Canada's Walk(s) of Fame, two Golden Globes (one in 1995 for \"Citizen X,\" the other in 2002 for \"Path to War\"), an Emmy (also for \"Citizen X\"), and an Academy Honorary Award in 2017, \"for a lifetime of indelible characters, rendered with unwavering truthfulness.\"", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Pines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Pines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Academy_of_Music_and_Dramatic_Art", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlet fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rheumatic fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_University,_Toronto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria University, Toronto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hepatitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/donald-sutherland-legendary-actor-of-incredible-range-has-died-at/l-intro-1718903430.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 767, "textEnd": 774}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He was 88.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, the actor's son, confirmed his father's death Thursday, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer Sutherland said on X. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.\"\n\nThe tall and gaunt Canadian actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\"\n\nBefore transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s .\n\nOver the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the \"Hunger Games\" films. He never retired, working regularly up until his death. A memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" was due out in November.\n\n\"I love to work. I passionately love to work,\" Sutherland told Charlie Rose in 1998. \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom -- time stops for me. I'm not as crazy as I used to be, but I'm still a little crazy.\"\n\nSutherland career as a leading man peaked in the 1970s, when he starred in films by the era's top directors -- even if they didn't always do their best work with him. Sutherland, who frequently said he considered himself at the service of a director's vision, worked with Federico Fellini (1976's \"Fellini's Casanova\"), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976's \"1900\"), Claude Chabrol (1978's \"Blood Relatives\") and John Schlesinger (1975's \"The Day of the Locust\").\n\nOne of his finest performances came as a detective in Alan Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971). It was during filming on \"Klute\" that he met Fonda, with whom he had a three-year-long relationship that began at the end of his second marriage to actor Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nSutherland had twins with Douglas in 1966: Rachel and Kiefer, who was named after Warren Kiefer, the writer of Sutherland's first film, \"Castle of the Living Dead.\"\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\"); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford.\n\nIt was Redford who, to the surprise of some, cast Sutherland as the father in his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People.\" Redford's drama about a handsome suburban family destroyed by tragedy won four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSutherland was overlooked by the academy throughout most of his career. He was never nominated but was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. He did, though, win an Emmy in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X\" and was nominated for seven Golden Globes (including for his performances in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"Ordinary People\"), winning two -- again for \"Citizen X\" and for the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\n\"Ordinary People\" also presaged a shift in Sutherland's career toward more mature and sometimes less offbeat characters.\n\nHis New York stage debut in 1981, though, went terribly. He played Humbert Humbert in Edward Albee's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita,\" and the reviews were merciless; it closed after a dozen performances.\n\nA down period in the '80s followed, thanks to failures like the 1981 satire \"Gas\" and the 1984 comedy \"Crackers.\"\n\nBut Sutherland continued to work steadily. He had a brief but memorable role in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991). He again played a patriarch for Redford in his 1993 movie \"Six Degrees of Separation.\" He played track coach Bill Bowerman in 1998's \"Without Limits.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Sutherland increasingly worked in television, most memorably in HBO's \"Path to War,\" in which he played President Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Redford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1976 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People_(John_Legend_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordinary People (John Legend song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federico Fellini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hippie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Kiefer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Kiefer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Locust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Day of the Locust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schlesinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Schlesinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernardo Bertolucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Casanova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giacomo Casanova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chabrol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claude Chabrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Roeg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

A life well lived.\"\n\nA prolific actor who appeared in more than 190 films and TV shows, Sutherland embodied an off-kilter appeal that served him brilliantly in a series of classic 1970s movies, which gradually evolved into a veteran gravitas in the latter stages of his career. He did not win a major award for any of his film roles (and was never nominated for a conventional Oscar), but did win two Golden Globes for best supporting actor for the TV movies Citizen X (in 1996) and Path to War (in 2003). Sutherland received an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nBorn in Canada in 1935, Sutherland studied engineering and drama at the University of Toronto, and opted to move to London in 1957 to join an acting class at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda). After a series of small roles on British TV shows including Man of the World, The Saint and The Avengers, and films such as the Hammer horror film Fanatic and the Amicus anthology Dr Terror's House of Horrors, Sutherland was cast in the action film The Dirty Dozen, as one of a group of prisoners trained up for a dangerous mission during the second world war.\n\nIn 2012 his role as the villainous President Snow in The Hunger Games introduced him to a new generation of filmgoers. He also starred in Stephen King horror Mr Harrigan's Phone and disaster thriller Moonfall in 2022. Most recently, he had a recurring role in TV series Lawmen: Bass Reeves with David Oyelowo.\n\nSutherland was married three times, to Lois Hardwick between 1959 and 1966, Shirley Douglas (1966-1970) and Francine Racette, whom he married in 1972.", "source": {"uri": "nationwideradiojm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nationwide 90FM"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A life well lived,\" Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire M*A*S*H (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in Klute, and then in 1973 played a grieving father in Don't Look Now that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. Klute sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy Animal House, Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in Ordinary People, Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards, including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including JFK (1991), Backdraft (1991), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Outbreak (1995), A Time To Kill (1996) and Instinct (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie Citizen X. In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed Cold Mountain (2003) and Pride & Prejudice (2005).\n\nIn the Hunger Games films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with The Hunger Games to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nTributes to Sutherland came in across Hollywood and Canada on Thursday.\n\nRon Howard, who directed Sutherland in \"Backdraft,\" called him \"one of the most intelligent, interesting and engrossing film actors of all time.\"\n\nSutherland had \"incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence,\" Howard wrote on X.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Nova Scotia, said Sutherland \"was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft and truly, truly a great Canadian artist.\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and television projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally army surgeon in M*A*S*H (1970), a quirky tank commander in Kelly\u2019s Heroes (1970), a small-town detective in Klute (1971), a libidinous professor in Animal House (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and a despairing father in Ordinary People (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in The Hunger Games (2012) and its sequels.\n\n\u201cI wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I\u2019ve played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\u201d Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada\u2019s New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman\u2019s Korean war satire M*A*S*H (1970), set during the 1950s. The film \u2013 later spun off into a television series \u2013 depicted high jinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans at that time during the Vietnam war era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in Kelly\u2019s Heroes as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood\u2019s luminaries, in Klute, and then in 1973 played a grieving father in Don\u2019t Look Now that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. Klute sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam war movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy Animal House, Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland\u2019s performance in Ordinary People, Hollywood superstar Robert Redford\u2019s directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including JFK (1991), Backdraft (1991), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Outbreak (1995), A Time To Kill (1996) and Instinct (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO television film Citizen X. In the 2000s, Sutherland appeared in the acclaimed Cold Mountain (2003) and Pride & Prejudice (2005).\n\nIn the Hunger Games films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he revelled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\u201cThe reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\u201d Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times newspaper in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt was funny at the beginning with The Hunger Games to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it\u2019s some young person \u2013 always a girl, never a boy,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cAnd her mother is standing there and they say: \u2018Could you take a photograph with my daughter?\u2019 And we\u2019d be standing beside each other and I\u2019d be looking at the camera and the girl would say: \u2018Could you look mean?\u2019\u201d\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a tribute, the 24 TV show star Kiefer wrote on Instagram: \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" PA reports.\n\nSutherland won a Golden Globe for the TV movie Path To War for playing presidential adviser Clark Clifford and another gong along with an Emmy Award for the the mini-series Citizen X. In 2017, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his acting but failed to get an Oscar nod during his lengthy career.\n\nSutherland's most recent roles included The Hunger Games film franchise as dictator president Coriolanus Snow, and as a judge in the 2023 TV show Lawmen: Bass Reeves. He also had roles in thriller The Mechanic, Roman epic The Eagle, war film The Dirty Dozen, satire The Day Of The Locust, horror Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, period drama Pride & Prejudice and drama Space Cowboys.\n\nSutherland is perhaps best known as the womanising Captain Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr in the 1970 film version of M*A*S*H, and would eventually becoming a leading campaigner against war. In 2012, he became a Commander of the Arts in France and was praised by the French culture minister Frederic Mitterrand for his \"extraordinary\" career.\n\nSutherland was about to publish his memoir Made Up, But Still True, later this year, which was set to explore \"an unfiltered account of his memories of his life\" from how life-changing a role M*A*S*H had been along with \"his far too many brushes with death\". The actor had infantile paralysis and rheumatic fever before almost dying from spinal meningitis as a child, and later left Canada for the UK to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda).\n\nSutherland's early roles in the 1960s included European and UK productions such as Castle Of The Living Dead, which starred Christopher Lee, and Fanatic with Tallulah Bankhead, before he was cast in The Dirty Dozen as one of the American convicts sent on a secret mission as part of the D-Day landings in the Second World War.\n\nA statement from CAA said: \"Acclaimed actor Donald Sutherland died today in Miami, Florida after a long illness. He was 88 years old.\"\n\nIt also said: \"Sutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren.\n\n\"A private celebration

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland was 88. According to various reports, Sutherland died in Miami following a long illness.\n\nSutherland, who received an honorary Oscar in 2017, was known to younger moviegoers for his more recent work as President Snow in \"The Hunger Games.\" But his resume includes many of the most notable films Hollywood has produced, including \"Klute,\" \"Ordinary People,\" \"Pride & Prejudice,\" \"The Day of the Locust\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\nHe won an Emmy Award in 1995 for his supporting work in HBO's \"Citizen X.\"\n\nBorn in Canada, Sutherland's big film break came when he was cast as a condemned Army prisoner in 1967's war classic \"The Dirty Dozen,\" joining a star-studded cast that included Lee Marvin, Telly Savalas and Charles Bronson, among others.\n\nThe success of that film helped him land top billing in another Army film, playing the original Hawkeye Pierce in the big-screen version of \"M*A*S*H.\" Yet another war epic followed with his appearance as the appropriately named Sgt. Oddball, a flighty tank squadron commander in \"Kelly's Heroes.\" The behind-the-lines quest for wartime gold also had an all-star cast, led by Clint Eastwood and including Savalas and Don Rickles.\n\nThe following year he appeared opposite Jane Fonda in \"Klute.\"\n\nSutherland was a nine-time Golden Globe Award nominee, winning in 2003 for his supporting role in \"Path to War,\" chronicling the events leading to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nHis other film roles included \"Space Cowboys\" -- re-teaming with Eastwood, \"The Italian Job,\" \"Cold Mountain,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Disclosure\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\"\n\nHe most recently portrayed a judge on the series \"Lawman: Bass Reeves.\"\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren.\n\nFuneral services are expected to be private.\n\n\"I was blessed to direct (Sutherland) in 'Backdraft,\"' director Ron Howard wrote on X Thursday. \"One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nHelen Mirren wrote, \"Donald Sutherland was one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain, and a great knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became. He was my colleague and became my friend. I will miss his presence in this world.\"\n\nActor/director Edgar Wright called Sutherland \"a favorite actor and always fascinating screen presence.\"\n\n\"He starred in two of my very favourite and most influential films -- 'Don't Look Now' and the 1978 'Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers,\"' Wright wrote. \"But that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography; a funny, laconic, but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his break-through in 'The Dirty Dozen,' and then on an incredible run in the 70s, 80s and beyond with 'M*A*S*H,' 'Kelly's Heroes,' 'Little Murders,' 'Klute,' 'Don't Look Now,' 'The Day Of The Locust,' 'Ordinary People' and 'JFK,' among many others. I even adore his very early appearances in 'Dr Terror's House Of Horrors' and 'The World Ten Times Over,' as well as his very silly cameo in 'Kentucky Fried Movie.\"'", "source": {"uri":

Early standouts include Pvt. Vernon Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen (1967), Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in M*A*S*H (1970), hippie tank commander Sgt. Oddball in Kelly's Heroes (1970), and the titular private eye in Alan J. Pakula's Klute (1971).\n\nThough he often played heroic characters, Sutherland also brought life to his share of villains, including a ruthless Nazi spy in Eye of the Needle (1981), and President Snow in the Hunger Games movies. He is also known for his devastating turn as a grieving father in Nicholas Roeg's sinister horror/thriller Don't Look Now (1973), which featured an infamously graphic (for its time) sex scene with Julie Christie.\n\nThe prolific actor's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also includes: The Split (1968); Paul Mazursky's Alex in Wonderland (1970); Start the Revolution Without Me (1970); Little Murders (1971); John Schlesinger's The Day of the Locust (1975); The Eagle Has Landed (1976); Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 (1976); Max Dugan Returns (1983); Oliver Stone's JFK (1991); A Time to Kill (1996); Without Limits (1998); Clint Eastwood's Space Cowboys (2000); Pride & Prejudice (2005); American Gun (2005); Ask the Dust (2006); Man on the Train (2011); The Leisure Seeker (2017); and The Burnt Orange Heresy (2020).\n\nSutherland is survived by his four sons, actors Kiefer Sutherland, Rossif Sutherland and Angus Sutherland and CAA executive Roeg Sutherland; a granddaughter, Sarah Sutherland, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' daughter on Veep; and his partner/wife since 1972, actress Francine Racette.\n\nKiefer confirmed his father's passing on Twitter, and shared the following tribute.", "source": {"uri": "comicbookmovie.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comic Book Movie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_the_Needle_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eye of the Needle (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

A private celebration of life will be held by the family.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rheumatic fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hepatitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Undoing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pillars of the Earth (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bass Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Sexy_Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirty Sexy Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Casanova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giacomo Casanova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Fellini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He was 88.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" actor Kiefer Sutherland wrote on X.\n\nThe elder Sutherland had a distinctive look -- and piercing eyes -- that brought a depth and mystery to the huge range of roles he inhabited over more than half a century on the big screen.\n\nOne of Canada's most famous sons, he played dashing leading men as well as antiheroes and villains, most recently making a name among a new generation of fans as the evil President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" wrote Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nReaction to the Emmy and Golden Globe-winner's death was swift, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailing his unique talents.\n\n\"I had the opportunity when I was much younger to meet Donald Sutherland, and even as a young man who hadn't had a full exposure to the depth of brilliance of Donald Sutherland, I was deeply, deeply star struck,\" he told a press conference.\n\n\"He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly, truly, a great Canadian artist, and he will be deeply missed.\"\n\nAfter what he himself termed a \"meandering\" start to his acting career, Donald Sutherland came to prominence in Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen,\" where 12 convicts are tasked with carrying out what appears to be a suicide mission in occupied France.\n\nStarring alongside luminaries such as Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas, Sutherland's impish charms caught the attention of producers of \"M*A*S*H.\"\n\nThough set in the Korean War, the 1970 film was widely seen as a sophisticated satire on the Vietnam War.\n\nHis casting opposite Elliott Gould turned Sutherland into a household name in 1970s America, and opened the door to a durable career that would see him work with some of the biggest names in show business.\n\nThey included Jane Fonda, with whom he starred in 1971's \"Klute,\" in which he played a detective who falls for the call girl he is supposed to be protecting.\n\nFonda won an Oscar for her performance, which she credited to her intense feelings for Sutherland, with whom she was in a relationship at the time.\n\nTheir off-screen chemistry brought Sutherland into her pacifist orbit, and he became active in anti-Vietnam War circles.\n\nThe pair put together a travelling revue, which irked the US government and landed them both under FBI surveillance.\n\nhg/des\n\nMore from this section\n\nExplore Monster Hunter Now GPS Spoofing: MocPOGO Launches

He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005).\n\nIn the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His career started in English and Scottish theaters before he moved on to film and television in the 60s. To the newer generations, he's perhaps best known for playing President Snow in the Hunger Games series, a role he was incredibly passionate about. Sutherland, who was a vocal anti-war activist, repeatedly spoke about the movie's potential to politically inform and mobilize young people.\n\nIn 1968, Sutherland contracted bacterial meningitis from the Danube River in Yugoslavia while shooting Kelly's Heroes, slipped into a coma, and nearly died. \"I died for four or five seconds,\" he told the L.A. Times in 1989. In childhood, he also battled infantile paralysis, polio, and rheumatic fever.\n\nIn 2017 he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award.

A life well lived.\"\n\nThe Creative Artists Agency also announced their client's death, saying Donald Sutherland died of a long illness in Miami, Florida.\n\nDonald Sutherland, a Canadian-born actor, rose to fame in the late 1960s and early '70s with film roles in \"The Dirty Dozen\" and \"MASH.\"\n\nIn Robert Altman's gonzo anti-war film from 1970, Sutherland played surgeon Hawkeye Pierce, the role later made famous by Alan Alda in the TV adaptation of \"MASH.\"\n\nSutherland cemented himself as one of Hollywood's most versatile leading men in the '70s. He starred as the detective opposite Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning role in the 1971 neo-noir \"Klute,\" played the grieving father in 1973's influential horror thriller \"Don't Look Now,\" and was central to one of the most shocking endings in sci-fi history in the 1978 version of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\nBut his career has spanned so many beloved projects that he became a household name for multiple generations.\n\nHis cinematic legacy covers a breadth of genre, from dramatic roles in \"JFK\" and \"Backdraft\" to comedies like \"Fool's Gold,\" the 2008 romance caper starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. He also famously revealed his cheekier side in the 1978 comedy classic \"Animal House.\"\n\nIn \"The Hunger Games\" franchise, he portrayed the villainous Panem President Coriolanus Snow, facing off against Jennifer Lawrence as young heroine Katniss Everdeen. He also played the role of loving father in the 2005 adaptation of \"Pride & Prejudice,\" which starred Keira Knightley.\n\nA franchise based on a young adult book series, \"The Hunger Games\" may have seemed an unlikely role for Sutherland. But the actor told the BBC in 2015 that he hoped the blockbuster hit would encourage young people to be more politically involved.\n\nHe described the passion of young fans who showed up to premieres as \"extraordinary.\"\n\n\"I have been convinced for the last 30 years that they weren't thinking politically at all,\" he told the BBC. \"The purpose of everybody involved in this was to try to get them engaged.\"\n\nSutherland also took on roles for the smaller screen, winning an Emmy for \"Citizen X.\" The 1995 made-for-television movie depicted the hunt for a serial killer in the Soviet Union, based on a real-life criminal case.\n\nHis television work in recent years included shows such as \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves,\" \"Commander in Chief,\" and \"Crossing Lines.\"\n\nSutherland has five children, daughter Rachel and sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer. He starred alongside Kiefer -- an accomplished actor in his own right as the star of the \"24\" TV franchise and movies such as \"The Lost Boys\" and \"Young Guns\" -- in the film \"Forsaken,\" a western that centered around the relationship between a father and son.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with NBC's \"TODAY\" show, he said that when they looked at each other during their scenes they each saw behind the eyes of an actor and into the eyes of father and son.\n\n\"It informs the situation and it's supposed to,\" he said. \"It's what we wanted.\"\n\nKiefer only had praise for his father, saying it was almost like \"cheating\" rather than acting.\n\n\"I have always felt that not only is my father one of the most prolific actors in the English language, but he's also one of the most important,\" he told the \"TODAY\" show. \"He's someone I have wanted to work with for my whole career.\"", "source": {"uri": "thetrentonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ani_afuekwe@thetrentonline.com", "name": "Ani Afuekwe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Alda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-noir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-noir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heist_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heist film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keira Knightley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

his acting career, Donald Sutherland came to prominence in Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen,\" where 12 convicts are tasked with carrying out what appears to be a suicide mission in occupied France.\n\nStarring alongside luminaries such as Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas, Sutherland's impish charms caught the attention of producers of \"MASH.\"\n\nThe sophisticated satire on the Vietnam War, in which he was cast opposite Elliott Gould, turned Sutherland into a household name in 1970s America, and opened the door to a durable career that would see him work with some of the biggest names in show business.\n\nhg/nro", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name":

He said of the film: \"The thing about Simon West [director of The Mechanic 2011] is, his intent is to tell the truth, it's to tell the truth about the relationship between fathers and sons. Between a surrogate father and a son. And between those two boys. He does that with such psychological truth and the basis of that and the coherency of this film is extraordinary, it's exquisite and Jason Statham comes to life as an actor.\"\n\nMore recently Sutherland appeared in the likes of The Hunger Games movies, and in 2017 was given the honorary Academy Award. He was sadly never nominated for an Oscar despite many remarkable performances across dozens of movies.\n\nSutherland is survived by his four sons and one daughter, along with his wife, Francine Racette.\n\nRelated Topicsdonald sutherland Paul Heath", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_heath@thehollywoodnews.com", "name": "Paul Heath", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simon West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Statham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Statham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thehollywoodnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Donald-Sutherland-in-Final-Days-Signature-Entertainment.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

According to a statement from his agency CAA, Sutherland died in Miami on Thursday following a prolonged illness.\n\nHi son, Kiefer Sutherland, also wrote about the news in an Instagram post, saying, \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\" He added that his father \"loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on July 17, 1935, Sutherland's journey into acting began with a degree in engineering from the University of Toronto, where he eventually found his true passion in drama. His towering presence at 6'4\" and his intense performances on screen became hallmarks of his versatile career, which encompassed over 200 film and television credits.\n\nSutherland's breakthrough came with his role in the 1967 war film \"The Dirty Dozen,\" which catapulted him into Hollywood stardom. He followed this success with memorable performances in \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Klute,\" and \"Don't Look Now,\" among many others. His ability to seamlessly transition between genres and characters, from serious dramas to comedies and thrillers, solidified his reputation as one of the most versatile actors of his generation.\n\nThroughout his career, Sutherland garnered numerous accolades, including an Emmy Award for his role in the HBO movie \"Citizen X\" and two Golden Globes. His commitment to his craft and his fearless approach to challenging roles earned him respect and admiration from audiences and peers alike.\n\nBeyond his achievements on screen, Sutherland cherished his family life. He was married three times and had five children.\n\nIn recent years, Sutherland continued to captivate audiences with roles in critically acclaimed series such as \"Trust\" and \"The Undoing.\" His last performances were a testament to his enduring talent and dedication to the craft he loved.\n\nIn 2017, Sutherland received an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a fitting tribute to a career that spanned generations and enriched the cinematic landscape. He leaves behind a legacy of memorable characters and timeless performances in film and television that have left an indelible mark on the industry, earning him a place among the greats. The entertainment world surely mourns his loss.", "source": {"uri": "flickdirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FlickDirect"}, "authors": [{"uri": "flickdirect_inc@flickdirect.com", "name": "FlickDirect Inc", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Toronto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Undoing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.flickdirect.com/cache/entertainment-news/06000-donald-sutherland-iconic-actor-of-mas-h-and-the-hunger-games-dies-at-88_7920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 728, "textEnd": 735}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

He was 88.\n\nFor over a half century, the Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actor memorably played villains, antiheroes, romantic leads and mentor figures. His profile increased in the past decade with his supporting role as the evil President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.\n\nMost recently, he appeared as Judge Parker on the series \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves\" and in the \"Swimming With Sharks\" series in 2022. His other recent recurring roles include the series \"Undoing\" and \"Trust,\" in which he played J. Paul Getty, and features \"Ad Astra\" and \"The Burnt-Orange Heresy.\"\n\nSutherland won a supporting actor Emmy for HBO's \"Citizen X\" in 1995 and was also nominated in 2006 for the Lifetime miniseries \"Human Trafficking.\"\n\nAfter what Sutherland called \"a meandering little career,\" including roles in low-budget horror pics like 1963's \"Castle of the Living Dead\" and 1965's \"Die! Die! My Darling!,\" he landed a part as one of the bottom six in 1967's \"The Dirty Dozen.\"\n\nSutherland told the Guardian in 2005 that he originally had one line in the film, until Clint Walker refused to play a scene requiring him to impersonate a general. According to Sutherland, director Robert Aldrich, who didn't know his name, suddenly turned to him and said, \"You! With the big ears! You do it!\"\n\nThe smart-alecky role was a perfect fit for Sutherland, whose wolfish sideways smile and boyish charm caught the attention of producer Ingo Preminger, who cast him as the anti-authoritarian surgeon Capt. \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in 1970's comedy smash hit \"MASH.\"\n\n\"MASH\" turned Sutherland, and co-star Elliott Gould, who played Capt. \"Trapper\" John, into major stars. But the tradition-bound actors had trouble adjusting to director Robert Altman's improvisational and often chaotic approach. According to Sutherland, Altman tried to fire him during the shoot, but Preminger held firm.\n\nIn a 1976 Playboy interview, Altman gave a different view, recalling that Sutherland loved his directorial style. \"His improvisation was profound,\" Altman said. \"He's a hell of an actor.\"\n\nSutherland also co-starred with Gould in 1971's inspired Alan Arkin-helmed black comedy \"Little Murders\" and again in director Irvin Kershner's 1974 misfire \"SPYS.\"\n\nIn the 1970 WWII actioner \"Kelly's Heroes,\" Sutherland joined Clint Eastwood, portraying Sgt. Oddball, an absurdly conceived but scene-stealing proto-hippie tank commander. (Sutherland reteamed with Eastwood in 2000's \"Space Cowboys,\" this time playing a former hotshot pilot.)\n\nWith 1971's \"Klute,\" a thriller/character study directed by Alan J. Pakula and co-starring Jane Fonda, Sutherland emerged as a credible romantic leading man. He portrayed a troubled detective who falls in love with a call girl (Fonda) whom he's protecting from a sadistic killer.\n\nFonda later gave Sutherland credit for her Oscar-winning best actress performance, because of \"all the intense feelings I was experiencing\" with him.\n\nThe two were having a love affair at the time, and the relationship stoked Sutherland's antiwar politics. He got involved with Vietnam Veterans Against the War and, along with Peter Boyle and Howard Hesseman, Fonda and Sutherland put together a traveling revue called FTA (Free the Army, popularly known as F*@k the Army). The Pentagon unsuccessfully tried to keep troops away from the shows; the FBI put both Sutherland and Fonda under surveillance.\n\nIn Nicholas Roeg's influential 1973 psychological horror film \"Don't Look Now,\" Sutherland's intriguing passivity and pared-down acting style helped highlight Julie Christie's performance. They portray a grieving married couple who flee England to Venice after the death of their little girl.\n\nThe film became controversial for an integral explicit sex scene between them, edited in a fragmented style. Roeg intercut their post-coital dressing to go out to dinner as the sequence unfolds. Even in a sex-obsessed era, the scene became -- and remains -- one of the most memorable ever filmed.\n\nAt the height of his success, Sutherland began to make eccentric career choices. He turned down John Boorman for \"Deliverance\" and chose Paul Mazursky's \"Alex in Wonderland\" (1970) over Peckinpah's \"Straw Dogs.\" He acted with Fonda again in \"Steelyard Blues\" (1973) and played Christ in Dalton Trumbo's \"Johnny Got His Gun\" (1971). Both fizzled at the box office.\n\nSutherland received mixed notices for his role as a hick in John Schlesinger's \"Day of the Locust\" (1975), played the title character in 1976's arty bomb \"Fellini's Casanova\" and a psychopathic fascist in Bertolucci's \"1900\" (1977). He had a memorable cameo in 1978 hit \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" playing a professor who is discovered having an affair with a student (Karen Allen). He took a small upfront fee for his work instead of an offered percentage of the profits. The actor estimated the choice cost him $14 million.\n\nSutherland rebounded with 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" convincing director Robert Redford to cast him as the grieving father trying to hold his family together after his older son's accidental death. Redford had originally offered him the part of the psychiatrist that eventually went to Judd Hirsch.\n\nIn 1981 WWII thriller \"Eye of the Needle,\" Sutherland gave one of his last romantic leading man performances on the bigscreen, albeit as a heavy -- a stranded German agent who falls for a lonely married woman (Kate Nelligan).\n\nAnother career peak came in 1998, when Sutherland convinced director-writer Robert Towne to cast him as coach and Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman in \"Without Limits,\" about U. of Oregon runner Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup). He was also memorable in 2005's \"Pride and Prejudice\" as Keira Knightley's father.\n\nSutherland made a lasting impression in smaller roles, such as Mister X, a high-placed Pentagon official who claims to know why JFK was murdered, in 1991's Oliver Stone-helmed \"JFK.\"\n\nRemarkably, Sutherland was never nominated for an Oscar, though his work in such films as \"Ordinary People\" and \"Without Limits\" is often cited by critics as among the finest of their respective decades.\n\nOther noteworthy roles include President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels; a safecracker in \"The Italian Job\" (2003); the father in \"Six Degrees of Separation\" (1993); a stylish safecracker in \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1978); and the lead in Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\nSutherland also appeared with son Kiefer in 1996's \"A Time to Kill.\" He turned down an offer to play the father of Kiefer's character, Jack Bauer, in \"24,\" his son's successful TV series. The two appeared together in the 2014 Western \"Forsaken.\"\n\nIn 2014 the actor also starred with Brie Larson in the India-set musical comedy \"Basmati Blues,\" written and directed by Dan Baron.\n\nSutherland's TV work includes \"The Superlative Seven\" episode of \"The Avengers\" (1967) and two episodes of \"The Saint\" (1965, 1966). He starred as Patrick \"Tripp\" Darling III in \"Dirty Sexy Money\" (2007-09) and as Nathan Templeton in \"Commander in Chief\" (2005-06). His TV miniseries work includes 2010's \"The Pillars of the Earth,\" based on Ken Follett's epic novel.\n\nIn one of his best TV roles, Sutherland portrayed Clark Clifford in John Frankenheimer's \"Path to War\" (2002). In 1995, he won a supporting actor Emmy for \"Citizen X\" (HBO).\n\nBorn in St. John, Canada, he studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art before getting roles in British TV shows and films such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint.\" \"The Saint\" star and director Roger Moore recommended him to the producers of \"The Dirty Dozen,\" and after the success of that film he moved to Hollywood.\n\nA private celebration of life will be held by the family.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Gould", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Gould"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Improvisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

As we grieve the heartbreaking news that Donald Sutherland died on June 20th, 2024, we want to know more about his family life.\n\nWe were always happy to see Donald Sutherland in any movie, and we're in awe of all the different roles he played over many decades. While we feel sad all over again at this awful news, let's find out who is five kids are.\n\nDonald Sutherland has five kids: Angus Sutherland, Rossif Sutherland, Roeg Sutherland, Rachel Sutherland, and Kiefer Sutherland, according to The Sun. Donald's children range in ages from 41 (Angus), 45 (Rossif) and 50 (Roeg) to 57 (Rachel and Kiefer).\n\nDonald and his first wife, Lois Hardwick, were married from 1959 to 1966 but didn't have any children together. Donald and his second wife, Shirley Douglas, were married from 1966 to 1970 and had twins Rachel and Kiefer Sutherland. Donald was still married to his third wife Francine Raclette at the time of his death, and they have three kids: Angus, Roeg, and Rossif Sutherland.\n\nAs we would expect, several of Donald's children must have been inspired by their amazing dad to become actors, and they're all in Hollywood in one way, shape, or form. But while we'd typically make yet another joke about Nepo Babies or wonder why so many stars' kids seem to copy their parents, Donald's children all sound like hard workers who are passionate about the career paths they've chosen.\n\nAccording to The List, Angus began working in film production after acting a little bit, and he has produced movies such as 1917. Rossif studied philosophy briefly in college and then starred in several TV shows, including Reign (where he met his now-wife Celina Sinden). Most recently, Rossif played Allen Albright in the prequel Orphan: First Kill and is starring in the upcoming TV drama Murder in a Small Town.\n\nOf course, we're all most familiar with Kiefer Sutherland, since he's the most famous. While his dad worked mostly in film, Kiefer is known for his TV roles like the super tough Jack Bauer on 24, a part he played from 2001 to 2010, and President Thomas Kirkman on Designated Survivor from 2016 to 2019. Kiefer's had some amazing movie roles too, though, including John \"Ace\" Merrill in Stand By Me.\n\nRoeg Sutherland may not be an actor, but he works at Creative Artists Agency as the Media Finance co-head, which is definitely impressive. Like Angus, Rachel Sutherland is in TV production and her resume includes being a post-production supervisor on Burden of Truth, Nurses, Pretty Hard Cases, and most recently, Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent (which is a nice nod to her father's Canadian roots).\n\nRossif and Kiefer Sutherland are both parents themselves now. Rossif and Sinden have a son named Theodore who was born in 2016, and Kiefer and Camelia Kath have a daughter named Sarah Sutherland.\n\nDonald Sutherland has always said sweet things about being a dad, and we can't even begin to imagine the grief they're feeling. In 2011, Donald gave an interview to Esquire and said, \"My children are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful people. They've taught me humility, pride, and fear.\"\n\nWhenever we read or heard interviews with Donald, he showed us his warm, friendly, and lovely personality, and he had a cheeky, quirky side to him too. It sounds like he gave his children a lot of middle names. In 2022, Kiefer Sutherland told The Guardian that he and his twin Rachel both have five middle names (which might actually be a good thing since many of us don't exactly love our middle moniker).\n\nWhile Kiefer Sutherland always spoke highly of his dad, it sounds like they had some road bumps in their relationship. Kiefer told Radio Times, \"I think if there was a complaint from either one of us, it was that we didn't get to spend enough time together.\" It sounds like they connected when co-starring in the 2016 movie Forsaken, and it's sweet to hear how much they enjoyed the experience. In an interview with People, Donald said his son is talented and called co-starring \"terrific.\" They might not have had the kind of connection they wanted to throughout Kiefer's childhood but it sounds like things got much better when Kiefer was older.\n\nKiefer Sutherland's post on X about his father's death is also proof of how much he cares about his late parent. Kiefer said he has \"a heavy heart\" and called him \"one of the most important actors in the history of film.\" Kiefer added that when reflecting on his father's life, he would call it \"A life well lived.\"", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aya_tsintziras@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Aya Tsintziras", "type":

He was 88.\n\nFor over a half century, the Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actor memorably played villains, antiheroes, romantic leads and mentor figures. His profile had recently increased with his supporting role as the evil President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.\n\nSutherland won a supporting actor Emmy for HBO's \"Citizen X\" in 1995 and was also nominated in 2006 for the Lifetime miniseries \"Human Trafficking.\"\n\nAfter what Sutherland called \"a meandering little career,\" including roles in low-budget horror pics like 1963's \"Castle of the Living Dead\" and 1965's \"Die! Die! My Darling!,\" he landed a part as one of the bottom six in 1967's \"The Dirty Dozen.\"\n\nSutherland told the Guardian in 2005 that he originally had one line in the film, until Clint Walker refused to play a scene requiring him to impersonate a general. According to Sutherland, director Robert Aldrich, who didn't know his name, suddenly turned to him and said, \"You! With the big ears! You do it!\"\n\nThe smart-alecky role was a perfect fit for Sutherland, whose wolfish sideways smile and boyish charm caught the attention of producer Ingo Preminger, who cast him as the anti-authoritarian surgeon Capt. \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in 1970's comedy smash hit \"MASH.\"\n\n\"MASH\" turned Sutherland, and co-star Elliott Gould, who played Capt. \"Trapper\" John, into major stars. But the tradition-bound actors had trouble adjusting to director Robert Altman's improvisational and often chaotic approach. According to Sutherland, Altman tried to fire him during the shoot, but Preminger held firm.\n\nIn a 1976 Playboy interview, Altman gave a different view, recalling that Sutherland loved his directorial style. \"His improvisation was profound,\" Altman said. \"He's a hell of an actor.\"\n\nSutherland also co-starred with Gould in 1971's inspired Alan Arkin-helmed black comedy \"Little Murders\" and again in director Irvin Kershner's 1974 misfire \"SPYS.\"\n\nIn the 1970 WWII actioner \"Kelly's Heroes,\" Sutherland joined Clint Eastwood, portraying Sgt. Oddball, an absurdly conceived but scene-stealing proto-hippie tank commander. (Sutherland reteamed with Eastwood in 2000's \"Space Cowboys,\" this time playing a former hotshot pilot.)\n\nWith 1971's \"Klute,\" a thriller/character study directed by Alan J. Pakula and co-starring Jane Fonda, Sutherland emerged as a credible romantic leading man. He portrayed a troubled detective who falls in love with a call girl (Fonda) whom he's protecting from a sadistic killer.\n\nFonda later gave Sutherland credit for her Oscar-winning best actress performance, because of \"all the intense feelings I was experiencing\" with him.\n\nThe two were having a love affair at the time, and the relationship stoked Sutherland's antiwar politics. He got involved with Vietnam Veterans Against the War and, along with Peter Boyle and Howard Hesseman, Fonda and Sutherland put together a traveling revue called FTA (Free the Army, popularly known as F*@k the Army). The Pentagon unsuccessfully tried to keep troops away from the shows; the FBI put both Sutherland and Fonda under surveillance.\n\nIn Nicholas Roeg's influential 1973 psychological horror film \"Don't Look Now,\" Sutherland's intriguing passivity and pared-down acting style helped highlight Julie Christie's performance. They portray a grieving married couple who flee England to Venice after the death of their little girl.\n\nThe film became controversial for an integral explicit sex scene between them, edited in a fragmented style. Roeg intercut their post-coital dressing to go out to dinner as the sequence unfolds. Even in a sex-obsessed era, the scene became -- and remains -- one of the most memorable ever filmed.\n\nAt the height of his success, Sutherland began to make eccentric career choices. He turned down John Boorman for \"Deliverance\" and chose Paul Mazursky's flat \"Alex in Wonderland\" (1970) over Peckinpah's \"Straw Dogs.\" He acted with Fonda again in \"Steelyard Blues\" (1973) and played Christ in Dalton Trumbo's \"Johnny Got His Gun\" (1971). Both fizzled at the box office.\n\nSutherland received mixed notices for his role as a hick in John Schlesinger's \"Day of the Locust\" (1975), played the title character in 1976's arty bomb \"Fellini's Casanova\" and a psychopathic fascist in Bertolucci's \"1900\" (1977). He had a memorable cameo in 1978 hit \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" playing a professor who is discovered having an affair with a student (Karen Allen). He took a small upfront fee for his work instead of an offered percentage of the profits. The actor estimated the choice cost him $14 million.\n\nSutherland rebounded with 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" convincing director Robert Redford to cast him as the grieving father trying to hold his family together after his older son's accidental death. Redford had originally offered him the part of the psychiatrist that eventually went to Judd Hirsch.\n\nIn 1981 WWII thriller \"Eye of the Needle,\" Sutherland gave one of his last romantic leading man performances on the bigscreen, albeit as a heavy -- a stranded German agent who falls for a lonely married woman (Kate Nelligan).\n\nAnother career peak came in 1998, when Sutherland convinced director-writer Robert Towne to cast him as coach and Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman in \"Without Limits,\" about U. of Oregon runner Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup). He was also memorable in 2005's \"Pride and Prejudice\" as Keira Knightley's father.\n\nSutherland made a lasting impression in smaller roles, such as Mister X, a high-placed Pentagon official who claims to know why JFK was murdered, in 1991's Oliver Stone-helmed \"JFK.\"\n\nRemarkably, Sutherland was never nominated for an Oscar, though his work in such films as \"Ordinary People\" and \"Without Limits\" is often cited by critics as among the finest of their respective decades.\n\nOther noteworthy roles include President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels; a safecracker in \"The Italian Job\" (2003); the father in \"Six Degrees of Separation\" (1993); a stylish safecracker in \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1978); and the lead in Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\"\n\nSutherland also appeared with son Kiefer in 1996's \"A Time to Kill.\" He turned down an offer to play the father of Kiefer's character, Jack Bauer, in \"24,\" his son's successful TV series. The two appeared together in the 2014 Western \"Forsaken.\"\n\nIn 2014 the actor also starred with Brie Larson in the India-set musical comedy \"Basmati Blues,\" written and directed by Dan Baron.\n\nSutherland's TV work includes \"The Superlative Seven\" episode of \"The Avengers\" (1967) and two episodes of \"The Saint\" (1965, 1966). He starred as Patrick \"Tripp\" Darling III in \"Dirty Sexy Money\" (2007-09) and as Nathan Templeton in \"Commander in Chief\" (2005-06). His TV miniseries work includes 2010's \"The Pillars of the Earth,\" based on Ken Follett's epic novel.\n\nIn one of his best TV roles, Sutherland portrayed Clark Clifford in John Frankenheimer's \"Path to War\" (2002). In 1995, he won a supporting actor Emmy for \"Citizen X\" (HBO).\n\nHe was a series regular in Ed Bernero's European crime series \"Crossing Lines.\"\n\nA private celebration of life will be held by the family.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "source": {"uri": "pilotonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virginian Pilot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Preminger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ingo Preminger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland has been a fixture on stage and screen for decades and was known for classic films such as \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Klute\" \"Ordinary People\" and \"Don't Look Now.\"\n\nFor younger audiences today, Sutherland is perhaps best known as the domineering villain President Snow in the original \"Hunger Games\" trilogy. He also appeared briefly in 2023's prequel film, \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,\" based on the book by Suzanne Collins.\n\nThe star of that feature, Rachel Zegler, took to Instagram shortly following the confirmation of Sutherland's passing, reposting the news with a pair of broken heart emojis.\n\nDirector Ron Howard, who directed Sutherland in the 1991 film \"Backdraft,\" posted a heartfelt message on X, calling the industry vet one of the most \"engrossing film actors of all time.\"\n\n\"I was blessed to direct him in 'Backdraft.' One of the most intelligent, interesting and engrossing film actors of all time,\" Howard wrote. \"Incredible range, creative courage and dedication to serving the story and the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nFilmmaker Edgar Wright also mourned Sutherland's death on X, revealing that he starred in \"two of my very favorite and most influential films -- 'Don't Look Now' and the 1978 'Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers.'\"\n\n\"But that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography; a funny, laconic but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his breakthrough in 'The Dirty Dozen,' and then on an incredible run in the '70s, '80s and beyond with 'M*A*S*H,' 'Kelly's Heroes,' 'Little Murders,' 'Klute,' 'Don't Look Now,' 'The Day of the Locust,' 'Ordinary People' and 'JFK,' among many others,\" Wright continued. \"I even adore his very early appearances in 'Dr Terror's House Of Horrors' and 'The World Ten Times Over,' as well as his very silly cameo in 'Kentucky Fried Movie.' I know many of you following me will feel the same way about this great screen legend's passing, so please list your favorite Donald Sutherland films.

Sutherland's son Kiefer also revealed his father's death on social media, writing, \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nThe epitome of a first-class character actor -- always reliable, yet often surprising -- Sutherland represented several Hollywood eras, coming up during the 1960s when the industry was entering a period of existential uncertainty, becoming a star during the 1970s counterculture renaissance, and then transitioning into a respected elder statesman, his effortless authenticity enlivening every film in which he appeared, whether it was as the mysterious whistleblower in JFK or the scheming President Snow in the Hunger Games films.\n\nBut his greatest stretch of performances started with 1970's MASH, in which he introduced the acerbic Hawkeye Pierce to the world, and continuing with his work as Detective John Klute in Klute and the troubled husband John Baxter in the psychological horror film Don't Look Now. Each character terrific yet very different from one another, they set in motion the range of roles (and films) Sutherland would tackle throughout his career. (Few actors can lay claim to being part of a signature generational comedy and then a somber, Oscar-winning family drama within the span of two years, but he pulled off that feat with National Lampoon's Animal House and Ordinary People.)\n\nNot bad for a man who initially thought he'd pursue a different art form before realizing it would be a mistake. \"I knew I wasn't going to be a sculptor,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2018. \"I needed the response. I needed an audience.\"\n\nBorn in July 1935 in New Brunswick, Canada, Donald McNichol Sutherland was a sickly child, battling polio, pneumonia and scarlet fever, among other diseases, as a boy. (He claimed that, because of spinal meningitis, \"I died for four or five seconds.\") Sutherland studied engineering at the University of Toronto, but he developed an interest in acting, becoming involved with the student theater troupe UC Follies at Hart House Theatre before heading to London and Scotland to hone his craft.\n\nHis earliest film roles included a 1964 Christopher Lee horror flick called Castle of the Living Dead, but his first real break came when he was cast in the war film The Dirty Dozen, where he played one of the titular 12 commandos, Vernon Pinkley. It was supposed to be a small part, but he got promoted when costar Clint Walker, who was Native American, objected to doing a scene where he impersonates a U.S. general, prompting director Robert Aldrich to give the memorable moment to Sutherland's character instead.\n\nThe scene-stealing sequence paved the way for him being cast in an anarchic 1970 war comedy called MASH, where he was paired up with Elliott Gould as Korean War surgeons trying to stay sane amidst the insanity, blood and death. One of the early landmarks of the so-called New Hollywood era, Robert Altman's bruising satire captured Sutherland's exquisite sardonic side -- not to mention his ability to wield his lanky 6'4\" frame with an almost balletic grace. The film, which was set in the past but clearly meant to comment on the contemporary Vietnam War, eventually became a popular, long-running sitcom, and years later, Sutherland still fondly remembered meeting Alan Alda, who played Hawkeye on the show. \"He said, 'My name is Alan Alda and I want to thank you for my life,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"And I thought, 'That's about as charming and as lovely and as generous as you can be.'\"\n\nHis subsequent work in Klute and Don't Look Now found him working alongside two of the most iconic actresses of the age -- Jane Fonda and Julie Christie -- in complicated, grownup relationship dramas that doubled as tense, intelligent thrillers. The latter contains one of the most sensual of all sex scenes, but Sutherland forever insisted that there was nothing voyeuristic or tawdry about the way he and Christie played it. \"Don't Look Now was a depiction of married intimacy,\" he once said, later adding, \"You don't watch people making love. What happens when you watch it is you remember having made love, having been in love yourself.\" Even so, his portrayal of a grief-stricken husband reeling from the tragic drowning of his son remains one of his most piercing, leading to as shocking a finale as any in all of cinema.\n\nIt was Sutherland's ability to convey a common touch that served him so well in his many everyman roles -- which only heightened the horror in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the hilarity of Animal House, where he played a groovy, pot-smoking professor, which came out the same year. (Speaking of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the film's chilling ending, where it's revealed that Sutherland's character has become part of the Pod, pointing and shrieking, decades later turned the actor's frozen scream into a ubiquitous internet meme.)\n\nConstantly working, Sutherland seemed to tap into something deeply personal for the Best Picture-winning Ordinary People, where he played Calvin, an emotionally distant father rendered inert by his son's death and the growing clash between his domineering wife (Mary Tyler Moore) and his suicidal surviving son (Timothy Hutton). Sutherland drew from his own difficult relationship with his salesman father. \"He was hard to deal with,\" Sutherland admitted in 2014, calling him \"possibly the most self-centered individual I've ever met. ... The problem is, he was my father and I wanted to please him. But yes, the minute I found success -- pretty much after MASH was released, he didn't do anything but complain about me.\"\n\nIn subsequent decades, he focused more on supporting roles, and by the '90s, he began to establish himself as a favorite of casting agents looking for warm paternal figures, playing business leaders, bosses and mentors. His one-scene appearance in Oliver Stone's jittery conspiracy thriller JFK, portraying a government man with insider information for Kevin Costner's Jim Garrison, was a highlight of that hallucinatory Oscar-winner, but he was equally sterling in the underrated 1998 Steve Prefontaine biopic Without Limits, in which his Bill Bowerman is the platonic ideal of the tough-love coach, pushing the long-distance runner to greater glory.\n\nBy this stage of his career, Sutherland's notoriety was being slightly eclipsed by his eldest son Kiefer's. (He has two other sons, Rossif and Roeg, who are also actors.) But during that decade, Sutherland won his first Golden Globe, for the HBO movie Citizen X, and appeared in the 1996 courtroom drama A Time to Kill alongside his son Kiefer. (Not growing up around Sutherland, Kiefer only started watching Donald's more adult films when he was 18, calling his dad in tears: \"I was so embarrassed that I didn't know what an important actor he was. And I considered myself a serious actor. So that was very embarrassing and I apologized for that and he was so sweet, he said 'Oh my God, that's okay, it's not your fault, how would you know?'\")\n\nAlthough Sutherland famously claimed not to watch his movies after he shot them, he amassed a formidable r\u00e9sum\u00e9, working with everyone from Paul Mazursky to Bernardo Bertolucci to Federico Fellini to Nicolas Roeg to James Gray. Collaborating with director John Frankenheimer, he earned his second Golden Globe for his role in the 2002 Vietnam War-era HBO drama Path to War, and his soothing voice provided the narration for Simply Orange television commercials. As for Katniss Everdeen fans, they adored him for his portrayal of the evil President Coriolanus Snow in the popular dystopian YA franchise. (He got the part by reading the script for The Hunger Games and writing the producers a letter. \"I thought it was an incredibly important film, and I wanted to be a part of it,\" he later explained. \"I thought it could wake up an electorate that had been dormant since the '70s.\")\n\nPolitically outspoken and a supporter of left-leaning causes, Sutherland was a forceful advocate for the dangers of climate change. But he also had an endearing penchant for ribald humor, once affectionally calling his wife of 52 years, Francine, \"one of the great farters of the world.\" In his 80s, he was asked about his thoughts on mortality. \"I am old, but I don't feel old,\" he replied. \"I feel very, very young actually, but my sphincter may be a little old.\"\n\nShockingly, he never received an Academy Award nomination, although he was presented with an honorary Oscar in 2017. \"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters I've played,\" he said humbly at the ceremony. \"Thank them for using their lives to inform my life.\" But despite the immense joy he brought to so many moviegoers, Sutherland didn't consider his work to be fun.\n\n\"It's joyful, it's passionate, it's rewarding, it's a pursuit of truth, but I don't think of it as fun,\" he said in 2016. \"It's not a game. It's a very serious endeavor for me. It's not for a lot of people. It was a wonderful job.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_grierson@rollingstone.com", "name": "Tim Grierson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frankenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Frankenheimer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Alda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hurt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Hurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scarlet fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_horror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological horror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland has been a fixture on stage and screen for decades and was known for classic films such as \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"MASH,\" \"Klute\" \"Ordinary People\" and \"Don't Look Now.\"\n\nFor younger audiences today, Sutherland is perhaps best known as the domineering villain President Snow in the original \"Hunger Games\" trilogy. He also appeared briefly in 2023's prequel film, \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,\" based on the book by Suzanne Collins.\n\nThe star of that feature, Rachel Zegler, took to Instagram shortly following news of Sutherland's passing, sharing broken heart emojis.\n\nDirector Ron Howard, who directed Sutherland in the 1991 film \"Backdraft,\" posted a heartfelt message on X, calling the industry vet one of the most \"engrossing film actors of all time.\"\n\n\"I was blessed to direct him in 'Backdraft.' One of the most intelligent, interesting and engrossing film actors of all time,\" Howard wrote. \"Incredible range, creative courage and dedication to serving the story and the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nFilmmaker Edgar Wright also mourned Sutherland's death on X, revealing that he starred in \"two of my very favorite and most influential films -- 'Don't Look Now' and the 1978 'Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.'\"\n\n\"But that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography; a funny, laconic but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his breakthrough in 'The Dirty Dozen,' and then on an incredible run in the '70s, '80s and beyond with 'M*A*S*H,' 'Kelly's Heroes,' 'Little Murders,' 'Klute,' 'Don't Look Now,' 'The Day of the Locust,' 'Ordinary People' and 'JFK,' among many others,\" Wright continued. \"I even adore his very early appearances in 'Dr. Terror's House of Horrors' and 'The World Ten Times Over,' as well as his very silly cameo in 'Kentucky Fried Movie.' I know many of you following me will feel the same way about this great screen legend's passing, so please list your favorite Donald Sutherland films. So sorry to see you go Donald, but what a legacy you leave behind.\"\n\nHelen Mirren, who acted alongside Sutherland in several projects -- including the 2017 comedy \"The Leisure Seeker\" and the 1990's \"Bethune: The Making of a Hero,\" issued a media statement.\n\n\"Donald Sutherland was one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain, and a great knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became. He was my colleague and became my friend. I will miss his presence in this world,\" she shared.\n\nFilmmaker Joe Russo kept his reaction short and sweet, writing, \"RIP to the GOAT.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_cahoone@thewrap.com", "name": "Lauren Cahoone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People_(John_Legend_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordinary People (John Legend song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backdraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edgar Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Locust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Day of the Locust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Bethune", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norman Bethune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Mirren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helen Mirren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He was 88.\n\nSon Kiefer Sutherland also confirmed his father's death \"with a heavy heart\" in a statement Thursday morning on social media. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland's body of work showcased his transformative range, shifting comfortably from drama to comedy and bouncing between heavier and lighter roles with ease. Tall at 6-foot-4 with shock white hair and piercing blue eyes, he was difficult to miss whether he was playing a zany oddball, an icy tyrant or a sadistic villain. In all, he had nearly 200 film or television roles.\n\n\"It's characters who make pictures,\" he told The Times in 1995. \"Essentially my job is to provide information about them.\"\n\nDeep in his career, as he shifted between leading and character parts, Sutherland thrived in smaller roles that ordinarily called for an older actor who'd long ago been typecast as a villain or a kooky sidekick. But Sutherland had the winning ability to transform those small roles into complex characters who often helped elevate the film.\n\nOn the small screen, Sutherland also appeared in \"Human Trafficking,\" \"Commander in Chief,\" \"Dirty Sexy Money,\" \"Pillars of the Earth\" and \"Trust.\" Though he originally intended to be a theatrical actor, his only Broadway appearance was in Edward Albee's short-lived adaptation of \"Lolita\" in 1981.\n\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born in St. John, a small fishing village in New Brunswick, Canada, on July 17, 1935. The town had only 5,000 residents, he said, and \"that was when the train rolled into town.\" One of four children, his mother was a mathematician and his father a salesman.\n\nInitially, he planned to be an engineer and attended Victoria College in Toronto, where he earned a degree in engineering and drama. It was also where he met his first wife, Lois Hardwick. His love of acting began in a Nova Scotia movie theater when he was a teen, but movie-acting seemed too lofty a pursuit, so he tried his luck in theater instead.\n\n\"It's not that theater was my first love. My first love was just to be an actor,\" he told The Times. \"I was kind of dumb and cowish, and I didn't think movies were something I could ever be part of. I don't know why I presumed that the theater would be. It was more ordinary, I suppose.\"\n\nHe moved to England in 1956 to study acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art but dropped out after nine months because he disliked its psychological approach to acting. He went on to tour with various repertory companies and appeared in several BBC television productions, including bit parts in \"The Saint\" and \"The Avengers.\"\n\nRejection became all-too familiar. When he tried to break onto the big screen in 1962, he came away thinking his audition had gone well. The next morning the director phoned him. \"The role we're casting is that of a guy who lives next door,\" the director said. \"You don't look like you've ever lived next door to anyone.\"\n\nHe finally made his first movie, \"The Castle of the Living Dead,\" in 1964 and followed it with a series of undistinguished films such as \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" and \"Die! Die! My Darling!\" His break came when he arrived in Hollywood in 1967, a year after his first marriage ended, to co-star in the 1968 thriller \"The Split.\"\n\n\"We had no money,\" said Sutherland, who by then was married to his second wife, actress Shirley Douglas. (They divorced in 1970.) So he called his \"Oedipus the King\" co-star Christopher Plummer of \"Sound of Music\" fame, who was working in Stratford, Canada, to get his input.\n\n\"I woke him up,\" Sutherland told The Times in 2011. \"He loaned me $1,500. Incredible. We were on a Boeing 707 -- Shirley, her son Tom. Kiefer and [his twin] Rachel were probably 3 or 4 months old. I had a raincoat on and I was holding Kiefer, and when we landed in Los Angeles, he threw up all over me.\"\n\nThe actor used a clip of his appearance on \"The Saint\" to land a role in his first major American film, \"The Dirty Dozen,\" in 1967. Sutherland credited legendary producer Ingo Preminger and director Robert Aldrich, who oversaw the 1967 World War II flick, for landing his later role in the film \"MASH.\"\n\n\"I was a glorified extra\" in \"The Dirty Dozen,\" Sutherland said. \"They hired legitimate actors to play the bottom six of the dozen.\"\n\nBut he quickly rose to fame in 1970 as the cocky surgeon Capt. Hawkeye Pierce in \"MASH\" and then as the neurotic platoon commander Oddball in \"Kelly's Heroes.\" He went on to appear in such seminal films as Alan J. Pakula's mystery \"Klute,\" Bernardo Bertolucci's epic \"1900\" and Federico Fellini's \"Casanova.\"\n\nThe plum roles continued to roll in with \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"The Day of the Locust,\" and the 1973 occult thriller \"Don't Look Now,\" which stirred controversy for a sex scene with Sutherland and Julie Christie that was unusually graphic for its time.\n\nAfter being a leading man through most of the 1970s, Sutherland began alternating between leading roles in films such as \"A Dry White Season\" with Marlon Brando and Robert Redford's Oscar-winning \"Ordinary People\" and character roles in films such as \"JFK\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nHe also appeared in lesser films that, nonetheless, became cult favorites, such as National Lampoon's \"Animal House,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nHis turn as the villainous leader President Coriolanus Snow opposite Jennifer Lawrence in the blockbuster \"Hunger Games\" trilogy gave him a new wave of recognition with younger audiences.\n\n\"It was funny,\" Sutherland told The Times in 2017, \"at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games,' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person -- always a girl, never a boy. And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?' \"\n\nDespite his lengthy resume, Sutherland had a dearth of accolades, winning but a few major acting awards for his performances -- an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the 1995 miniseries \"Citizen X\" and another Globe for 2002's \"Path to War.\" But the lack of award season hardware didn't seem to trouble him.\n\n\"My career has been all downhill since the age of 11. I did my first play, 'The Male Animal,' at Toronto University's Hart House theater. The audience laughed and applauded when I came on, they applauded when I went off, and they applauded when I came on again. I've never had it as good since,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017 he was given an honorary Oscar, which recognizes extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement and exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences.\n\nThe actor's short-lived romance with Jane Fonda after making \"Klute\" in 1971 introduced him to left-wing politics and a second career as a hard-charging activist. The two had met at a Black Panther Party benefit in Los Angeles where he voiced his opposition of the Vietnam War. Sutherland, Fonda and other antiwar activists went on to form the Free Theatre Associates as an alternative to Bob Hope's USO tours in Vietnam. Documents declassified in 2017 revealed the CIA had placed him on a watch list because of his antiwar activities.\n\nWatching his father's seminal films was a revelation for Kiefer Sutherland, who came to appreciate his father's body of work as a teenager. \"I knew he was a famous actor, but I didn't know how prolific he was. I didn't know how diverse all of those characters were.\"\n\nThe younger Sutherland, best known for his leading role in the television drama \"24,\" said he even called his father to apologize for not knowing the magnitude of his career.\n\nThe two Sutherlands both appeared in Joel Schumacher's 1996 thriller \"A Time to Kill,\" but they did not share any scenes.

He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005).\n\nIn the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham, Patricia Reaney and Lisa Richwine; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com",

Throughout a career spanning from the 1960s to the 2020s, Sutherland captivated audiences with his deep voice and piercing blue eyes.\n\nDonald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Klute,\" \"Ordinary People\" and the \"Hunger Games\" films, has died at the age of 88. The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.\n\nThe tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s. One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels. \"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). He rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"M*A*S*H\" (1970). The film - later spun off into a TV series - depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis. The following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings. Sutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\" In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005). In the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. \"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

He was 88.\n\nHis son, fellow actor Kiefer Sutherland, announced the news with a statement on X/Twitter on Thursday, which you can read in full below.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Donald Sutherland died in Miami on Thursday following a long illness.\n\nSutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and largely grew up there and in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, before moving to Britain to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There, he picked up a number of small British film and TV roles before truly getting his big breakthrough in Robert Aldrich's 1967 war film The Dirty Dozen.\n\nSome of his biggest roles would come in quick succession after that, starring in the 1970 M*A*S*H film as Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr. His other big roles in that prolific early '70s period include Kelly's Heroes (1970), Klute (1971), Don't Look Now (1973), and The Day of the Locust (1975). He also had a memorable part in John Landis' 1978 comedy classic Animal House.\n\nHe would continue to get steady work in the ensuing decades, starting the '80s with Robert Redford's directorial debut, the beloved 1980 drama Ordinary People, which would go onto score a Best Picture Oscar nomination. His other major film credits in the '80s and '90s include Eye of the Needle, A Dry White Season, Backdraft, JFK, Six Degrees of Separation, and Without Limits. In 2005, he starred alongside Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen in Pride and Prejudice.\n\nYounger generations, though, might know Sutherland best for his crucial role in The Hunger Games films, where he played the villainous President Snow. A younger version of the character was portrayed by Tom Blyth in last year's prequel film The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.\n\nOver the course of his career, Sutherland won a number of awards, including a Primetime Emmy, two Golden Globes, and a Critics Choice Award. In addition to Kiefer, Donald Sutherland is survived by three other sons, a daughter, his wife Francine Racette, and four grandchildren.\n\nImage credit: Carlos R.

CAA announced the news.\n\nIn some of his most well-known roles, he perfected a laconic, wry and dead-serious delivery as such characters as the cool-headed amateur murder investigator John Klute, opposed Jane Fonda's terrified, erratic call girl Bree Daniels, in Klute; as the Hawkeye Pierce in the film MASH, where he played opposite Elliott Gould's cut-up Trapper John; and in Nicolas Reog's Don't Look Now as skeptical John Baxter, who does not believe the claims of wife Laura (Julie Christie) that their recently dead daughter is reaching out from the other side.\n\nBorn on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Donald Sutherland amassed some 200 film and TV credits spanning more than 60 years, from guesting on episodes of 1960s series including Suspense, The Avengers, Court Martial and The Odd Man to last year's Paramount+ drama Bass Reeves. His big break in movies came with Robert Aldrich's star-packed 1967 World War II drama The Dirty Dozen, playing Vernon Pinkley opposite Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, George Kennedy, Telly Savalas and others. A hit in theaters, it remains a seminal American war movie.\n\nHis next big role was as Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in Robert Altman's 1970 Korean War dramedy MASH. The alternatively harrowing and hilarious film earned five Oscar nominations including Best Picture, winning for Ring Lardner Jr.'s biting screenplay, and fueled the 1972-83 CBS series in which Alda Alda played Hawkeye.\n\nSutherland followed that with another star-laden war movie, 1970's Kelly's Heroes, playing Sgt. Oddball alongside Clint Eastwood, Don Rickles, Savalas and others. That led to perhaps his biggest star turn, in the 1971 Alan J. Pakula crime drama Klute. He starred opposite Fonda as New York Detective John Klute, who is hired to find a chemical company executive who has disappeared. Fonda won her first Oscar for the role, and Andy Lewis & Dave Lewis were nominated for their Original Screenplay.\n\nSutherland won a Golden Globe for the television movie Path to War, an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for his performance in the miniseries Citizen X. His extensive television credits also include The Undoing, Trust, Dirty Sexy Money, and The Pillars of the Earth, among many others.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren.

He was 88.\n\nSutherland died Thursday, June 20 in Miami after a long illness, CAA's Missy Davy confirmed with PEOPLE. \"A private celebration of life will be held by the family,\" Davy said.\n\nThe actor is survived by five children, including his 24 actor son Kiefer, whom he shared with ex-wife actress Shirley Douglas, and five grandchildren.

I have been a partner to her for over 45 years, and in all that she has supported me with her intelligence, her intuition, her instruction, her ability to make me laugh in the direst of situations, her extraordinary sense of taste, her residual belief in me.\"\n\nSutherland continued, \"Amongst all of these, her ability to absorb and sustain the extraordinary ups and downs of this crazy movie life we have gone through. I mean, she deserves a medal for that. So, Francine, I'm going to get you a medal.\"\n\nIn 2022, Kiefer told The Guardianhow his famous dad's career inspired his own Hollywood path.\n\n\"It's hard to think of another actor who's been as prolific and made films as diverse as Ordinary People, Don't Look Now, Fellini'sCasanova, Bertolucci's 1900 and The Hunger Games,\" he said. \"His influence was to make my career as diversified and interesting as possible, which he taught me by doing, not by saying, which was really cool.\"\n\nSutherland told Variety in 2014 that he didn't expect his Hunger Games role to be so iconic -- to the point that young fans would ask him for photos for years afterward. Tom Blyth plays a younger version of Sutherland's Coriolanus Snow in the prequel film The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\n\"Usually, right before the picture is taken the young woman will say, 'Why do you look so mean?' \" joked Sutherland, who also recalled of when he knew the franchise was a big deal, \"I was at my dermatologist, and she asked me what I was doing next. I told her I was about to do something called The Hunger Games. She gasped and started calling everyone into the room, and they all came running. That was my first inkling it might be something big.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_vanhoose@aol.com", "name": "Benjamin VanHoose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People_(John_Legend_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ordinary People (John Legend song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennet_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bennet family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keira Knightley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_with_Sharks_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming with Sharks (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Undoing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NaIdBK38S.xV6Vikajcb6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_people_articles_471/b347d635752b193c599477037261ea38", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 377, "textEnd": 384}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 101}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Some of his most iconic projects include \"Don't Look Now,\" \"M*A*S*H,\" and \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\nHis son, actor Kiefer Sutherland took to his social media handle on X to break the tragic news to Sutherland's fans and well-wishers. \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" his post read.\n\nDonald Sutherland's distingueshed career was marked by his versatility and distinctive presence on the big and small screens alike. Appearing in over 190 films and television shows, Sutherland had come to be know for his offbeat charm in a series of classic 1970s films, evolving into a figure of veteran gravitas in his later years. Despite never winning a major film award, Sutherland's contributions to cinema were recognized with two Golden Globes for his supporting roles in the TV movies \"Citizen X\" (1996) and \"Path to War\" (2003), as well as an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nBorn in Canada in 1935, Sutherland initially studied engineering and drama at the University of Toronto before moving to London in 1957 to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda). His early career involved small roles on British TV shows like \"Man of the World,\" \"The Saint,\" and \"The Avengers,\" as well as films such as \"Fanatic\" and \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.\" His breakthrough came with the action film \"The Dirty Dozen,\" where he played one of a group of prisoners on a dangerous mission during World War II.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Dirty Dozen,\" Sutherland starred in the influential Korean War comedy \"M*A*S*H\" as the rule-bending surgeon \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, and in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as a quirky tank commander. His role in \"M*A*S*H\" cemented his status as a leading man in Hollywood.\n\nSutherland's career took a more radical turn with roles in films like \"Klute,\" where he played a detective opposite Jane Fonda's sex worker, and the anti-Vietnam War documentary \"FTA.\" His activism led to him being on the National Security Agency's \"watch list\" between 1971 and 1973.\n\nALSO READ: Allu Arjun's 'Pushpa 2 To Hit Screens in December?

He starred opposite Julie Christie in the psychological horror \"Don't Look Now,\" played the title role in Federico Fellini's \"Casanova,\" and appeared in Bernardo Bertolucci's epic \"1900.\" His performance in \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" and the remake of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" further showcased his range.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, Sutherland transitioned to character roles, appearing in films like \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" \"JFK,\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\" He also had prominent roles in \"A Time to Kill,\" \"Space Cowboys,\" and \"Pride & Prejudice.\"\n\nIn 2012, Sutherland introduced himself to a new generation as the villainous President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" series. He continued to work in recent years, with roles in \"Mr. Harrigan's Phone\" and \"Moonfall.\" His last TV role was in the series \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland's memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" is set to be released posthumously in November. The book promises an unfiltered account of his life, offering insights, emotions, and humor.\n\nSutherland was married three times: to Lois Hardwick (1959-1966), Shirley Douglas (1966-1970), and

Thankfully, he was recognized with an honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nGenerations of fans have loved Donald Sutherland for one reason or another.\n\nThe 1967 film \"The Dirty Dozen\" is what set off his career. From there, he was cast as Capt. \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in 1970's comedy smash hit \"MASH.\"\n\nIn more recent years, he's known to millennial fans for his role as Mr. Bennet alongside Keira Knightley in the film adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\".

He was 88.\n\nSon Kiefer Sutherland also confirmed his father's death \"with a heavy heart\" in a statement Thursday morning on social media. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland's body of work showcased his transformative range, shifting comfortably from drama to comedy and bouncing between heavier and lighter roles with ease. Tall at 6 feet, 4 inches, with shock white hair and piercing blue eyes, he was difficult to miss whether he was playing a zany oddball, an icy tyrant or a sadistic villain. In all, he had nearly 200 film or television roles.\n\n\"It's characters who make pictures,\" he told The Times in 1995. \"Essentially my job is to provide information about them.\"\n\nDeep in his career, as he shifted between leading and character parts, Sutherland thrived in smaller roles that ordinarily called for an older actor who'd long ago been typecast as a villain or a kooky sidekick. But Sutherland had the winning ability to transform those small roles into complex characters who often helped elevate the film.\n\nOn the small screen, Sutherland also appeared in \"Human Trafficking,\" \"Commander in Chief,\" \"Dirty Sexy Money,\" \"Pillars of the Earth\" and \"Trust.\" Though he originally intended to be a theatrical actor, his only Broadway appearance was in Edward Albee's short-lived adaptation of \"Lolita\" in 1981.\n\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born in St. John, a small fishing village in New Brunswick, Canada, on July 17, 1935. The town had only 5,000 residents, he said, and \"that was when the train rolled into town.\" One of four children, his mother was a mathematician and his father a salesman.\n\nInitially, he planned to be an engineer and attended Victoria College in Toronto, where he earned a degree in engineering and drama. It was also where he met his first wife, Lois Hardwick. His love of acting began in a Nova Scotia movie theater when he was a teen, but movie-acting seemed too lofty a pursuit, so he tried his luck in theater instead.\n\n\"It's not that theater was my first love. My first love was just to be an actor,\" he told The Times. \"I was kind of dumb and cowish, and I didn't think movies were something I could ever be part of. I don't know why I presumed that the theater would be. It was more ordinary, I suppose.\"\n\nHe moved to England in 1956 to study acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art but dropped out after nine months because he disliked its psychological approach to acting. He went on to tour with various repertory companies and appeared in several BBC television productions, including bit parts in \"The Saint\" and \"The Avengers.\"\n\nRejection became all-too familiar. When he tried to break onto the big screen in 1962, he came away thinking his audition had gone well. The next morning the director phoned him. \"The role we're casting is that of a guy who lives next door,\" the director said. \"You don't look like you've ever lived next door to anyone.\"\n\nHe finally made his first movie, \"The Castle of the Living Dead,\" in 1964 and followed it with a series of undistinguished films such as \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" and \"Die! Die! My Darling!\" His break came when he arrived in Hollywood in 1967, a year after his first marriage ended, to co-star in the 1968 thriller \"The Split.\"\n\n\"We had no money,\" said Sutherland, who by then was married to his second wife, actress Shirley Douglas. (They divorced in 1970.) So he called his \"Oedipus the King\" co-star Christopher Plummer of \"Sound of Music\" fame, who was working in Stratford, Canada, to get his input.\n\n\"I woke him up,\" Sutherland told The Times in 2011. \"He loaned me $1,500. Incredible. We were on a Boeing 707 - Shirley, her son Tom. Kiefer and [his twin] Rachel were probably 3 or 4 months old. I had a raincoat on and I was holding Kiefer, and when we landed in Los Angeles, he threw up all over me.\"\n\nThe actor used a clip of his appearance on \"The Saint\" to land a role in his first major American film, \"The Dirty Dozen,\" in 1967. Sutherland credited legendary producer Ingo Preminger and director Robert Aldrich, who oversaw the 1967 World War II flick, for landing his later role in the film \"MASH.\"\n\n\"I was a glorified extra\" in \"The Dirty Dozen,\" Sutherland said. \"They hired legitimate actors to play the bottom six of the dozen.\"\n\nBut he quickly rose to fame in 1970 as the cocky surgeon Capt. Hawkeye Pierce in \"MASH\" and then as the neurotic platoon commander Oddball in \"Kelly's Heroes.\" He went on to appear in such seminal films as Alan J. Pakula's mystery \"Klute,\" Bernardo Bertolucci's epic \"1900\" and Federico Fellini's \"Casanova.\"\n\nThe plum roles continued to roll in with \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"The Day of the Locust,\" and the 1973 occult thriller \"Don't Look Now,\" which stirred controversy for a sex scene with Sutherland and Julie Christie that was unusually graphic for its time.\n\nAfter being a leading man through most of the 1970s, Sutherland began alternating between leading roles in films such as \"A Dry White Season\" with Marlon Brando and Robert Redford's Oscar winning \"Ordinary People\" and character roles in films such as \"JFK.\"\n\nHe also appeared in lesser films that, nonetheless, became cult favorites, such as National Lampoon's \"Animal House\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nDespite his lengthy resume, Sutherland had a dearth of accolades, winning but a few major acting awards for his performances - an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the 1995 miniseries \"Citizen X\" and another Globe for 2002's \"Path to War.\" But the lack of award season hardware didn't seem to trouble him.\n\n\"My career has been all downhill since the age of 11. I did my first play, 'The Male Animal,' at Toronto University's Hart House theater. The audience laughed and applauded when I came on, they applauded when I went off, and they applauded when I came on again. I've never had it as good since,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017 he was given an honorary Oscar, which recognizes extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement and exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences.\n\nThe actor's short-lived romance with Jane Fonda after making \"Klute\" in 1971 introduced him to left-wing politics and a second career as a hard-charging activist. The two had met at a Black Panther Party benefit in Los Angeles where he voiced his opposition of the Vietnam War. Sutherland, Fonda and other antiwar activists went on to form the Free Theatre Associates as an alternative to Bob Hope's USO tours in Vietnam. Documents declassified in 2017 revealed the CIA had placed him on a watch list because of his antiwar activities.\n\nWatching his father's seminal films was a revelation for Kiefer Sutherland, who came to appreciate his father's body of work as a teenager. \"I knew he was a famous actor, but I didn't know how prolific he was. I didn't know how diverse all of those characters were.\"\n\nThe younger Sutherland, best known for his leading role in the television drama \"24,\" said he even called his father to apologize for not knowing the magnitude of his career.\n\nThe two Sutherlands both appeared in Joel Schumacher's 1996 thriller \"A Time to Kill,\" but they did not share any scenes. That changed when they played an estranged father and son in the Western \"Forsaken\" in 2015.\n\nSutherland said he generally didn't watch his films after they were released, but when he did, he said he noticed room for improvement.\n\n\"I have to be truthful - I am still looking forward when I look back. All I see are mistakes,\" he told The Times. \"When you are working on a picture, all of your concentration, all of your intensity is directed toward the heart of it, to such a degree it burns inside of you. Then after it's over, it's gone.\"\n\nSutherland is survived by wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus and Kiefer; daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren, including \"Veep\" actress Sarah Sutherland.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nardine_saad@fresnobee.com", "name": "Nardine Saad", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Such things shouldn't matter. But the argument gave cinema watchers an opportunity to run through the performances that deserved to have been so honoured.\n\nThink of his anarchic turn as Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H from 1970. How did they ignore his icy cop in Alan Pakula's Klute from 1971? Everyone else in the cast seemed to get nominated for Robert Redford's 1980 best-picture winner Ordinary People. Best of all, perhaps, was his 1973 performance as a bereaved father haunted among Venetian shadows in Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now. One saw the full range there. He could wrap stentorian importance about himself, but there was, even in such harrowing material, always a sliver of sly wit poking through. Sutherland forever seemed to be in on a secret.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, his son, himself a busy actor, spoke for many who never met the man. \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\"\n\n[ Donald Sutherland, Hunger Games and Don't Look Now actor, dies at 88 ]\n\nDonald Sutherland, who received the Order of Canada as far back as 1978, was born in New Brunswick to middle-class parents. Plagued with illness as a child, he moved with his family to Nova Scotia at the age of 12. He graduated in drama and engineering from Victoria University in Toronto before making for the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\n\"I don't think anybody of my generation became an actor to make money,\" he told the BBC in 2015. \"It never occurred to me. I made \u00a38 a week here. When I starred in a play at the Royal Court, I made \u00a317 a week, that was in 1964.\"\n\nHis first screen roles were in British films and television. He can be seen in the enjoyable anthology Dr Terror's House of Horror from 1965 and opposite Christopher Lee in the historical shocker Castle of the Living Dead from 1964. His breakthrough came as one of 12 hoodlums sent on a commando raid in Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen.\n\nThen came Altman's M*A*S*H. That film, with its salty language and overlapping dialogue, was among those ushering in a new era for Hollywood. Alongside Elliot Gould, he played an army doctor driven to cynicism by the apparently pointless war in Korea (an unmistakable stand-in for Vietnam).\n\nMore challenging work came as American cinema continued to map out its post-classical route, but Sutherland was in a different category to gnarlier talents such as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. He had a restraint and a stillness that, if he wasn't speaking in his own accent, could easily be mistaken for the product of an English upbringing.\n\nSolid and inhibited opposite Jane Fonda's freethinking call girl in Klute, he looked to be in total control, but, in a later interview, he revealed he didn't fully connect with Pakula's technique. He said Klute \"was a film where the director had a specific idea, which I didn't particularly understand, nor was I particularly interested in\".\n\nEverything came together in Don't Look Now, a film rich in mystery that, infuriatingly for the cast, generated absurd rumours that a famous sex scene between Sutherland and Julie Christie was \"unsimulated\".\n\nSutherland was never again short of work. He did not have the dashing elan of a matinee idol, but that warm - sometimes frightening - energy found him endlessly satisfying character roles for the succeeding 50 years. He is delightful as a conspiracy theorist in Oliver Stone's JFK from 1991. In the current century he excelled as Keira Knightley's dad in Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice and as the flamboyantly named President Coriolanus Snow in the Hunger Games films.\n\nDonald Sutherland, who was married three times, is survived by his wife, the Canadian actor Francine Racette, and by five children, among them Kiefer, star of the hit series 24. His granddaughter, Sarah Sutherland, triumphed as the eponymous vice-president's miserable daughter in the comedy show Veep.\n\n\"I haven't found anything hard about being an actor except rejection,\" he told Esquire magazine in 2011. \"And I don't even find that so hard.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I will miss his presence in this world.\"\n\nFilmmaker, actor and 2017's \"Baby Driver\" director Edgar Wright posted his tribute to X, praising Sutherland's legacy in film and TV.\n\n\"RIP the great Donald Sutherland, a favourite actor and always fascinating screen presence. He starred in two of my very favourite and most influential films - 'Don't Look Now' and the 1978 'Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers,'\" Wright tweeted. \"But that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography; a funny, laconic, but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his break-through in 'The Dirty Dozen', and then on an incredible run in the 70's, 80's and beyond with 'M*A*S*H', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Little Murders', 'Klute', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Day Of The Locust', 'Ordinary People' and 'JFK', among many others. I even adore his very early appearances in 'Dr Terror's House Of Horrors' and 'The World Ten Times Over', as well as his very silly cameo in 'Kentucky Fried Movie'.\"\n\n\"I know many of you following me will feel the same way about this great screen legend's passing, so please list your favourite Donald Sutherland films,\" he continued. \"So sorry to see you go Donald, but what a legacy you leave behind.\"\n\nDirector Ron Howard wrote on X, \"I was blessed to direct him in #Backdraft. One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nSee more reactions below:\n\nAuthor Margaret Atwood remembered a fellow Canadian, writing on X that like her, he attended Victoria University, \"Oh no! He went to Vic in Toronto..he was a great actor even then.\"\n\nFilmmaker Mark Cousins wrote, \"Lucky to have known great movie actors. But #DonaldSutherland's death hits hard. Intellectually brilliant, full of doubt about his own beauty, searching. He loved talking abt books, sex, Fellini, Jane Fonda, politics. Dazzling.\"\n\nThe Black List Founder and film and TV producer Franklin Leonard shared a tribute via X, saying \"A legend has passed.\"\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in June 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in June 2024\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" Kiefer wrote.\n\nAlthough Kiefer didn't reveal a cause of death, Deadline confirmed via Donald's rep that he had been ill for quite some time but did not give specifics.\n\nThe Ordinary People actor is survived by his wife Francine Racette and five children, Kiefer, Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Rachel, as well as four grandchildren.\n\nThere's no question that Donald was a Hollywood legend with a career that spanned over five decades. Donald played a range of roles but was known for playing a more sinister character.\n\nThe Hunger Games, Don't Look Now, Klute, Kelly's Heroes Six Degrees of Separation, and JFK are just a few of Donald's stellar acting roles. Despite being a gifted actor who always earned praise for his performances, Donald was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nIn 2017, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Donald an honorary statuette at the Governors Awards.\n\nDonald didn't just bring his talent to the big screen. The actor also appeared in television series such as The Undoing, Trust, Dirty Sexy Money, and The Pillars of the Earth. He won a Golden Globe for his performance in the TV movie Path to War.\n\nX has quickly become a memorial for Donald, with fans and those he worked with paying tribute to the late great actor.\n\nDirector and actor Ron Howard was one of the first to speak out, writing, \"#RIPDonaldSutherland. I was blessed to direct him in #Backdraft. One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence.\"\n\nAnother X read, \"Donald Sutherland gave great performances in some lousy films, and brilliant performances in some great ones. What he never did, however, was give boring performances. A class act. The world is a colder place. RIP.\"\n\nA different tribute said, \"Since the mid-1960s and through the decades, Donald Sutherland brought his singular onscreen presence to roles large and small, always putting a unique spin on his characters. Rest well and thank you for an incredible and wide-ranging body of work, good sir.\"\n\nThere was one that not only honored Donald but shared what a loss his passing was for the acting world.\n\nThose are just a few of the messages coming in to honor Donald Sutherland, who has passed away at age 88. The actor spent decades in Hollywood entertaining fans with his outstanding talent.", "source": {"uri": "monstersandcritics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Monsters and Critics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachelle_lewis@monstersandcritics.com", "name": "Rachelle Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Undoing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governors Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Sexy_Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dirty Sexy Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Separation_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Six Degrees of Separation (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Sutherland was also superb at being a bad guy, most notably in the recent \"The Hunger Games\" dystopian sci-fi franchise, where he played the supremely nasty President Snow.\n\nSutherland was also known for his charismatic portrayal of real-life Canadian wartime hero Dr. Norman Bethune, the physician he portrayed in \"Dr. Bethune\" (AKA \"Bethune: The Making of a Hero\") in 1990 and also 13 years earlier in \"Bethune,\" a made-for-TV film.\n\nIt was all grist for the mill of the New Brunswick-born Sutherland, a man of irascible wit who was quick to puncture any pomposity he encountered, especially when the topic turned to his vast influence on Canadian film.\n\nWhen he sat as a member of the Palme d'Or jury at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, the snowy-bearded actor made light of his birth country's obsessions about what constituted Canadian identity in movies.\n\n\"I kind of gave up talking about Canadian cinema a long time ago,\" he said with an impish smile.\n\n\"There's a very famous story of a British soldier and a French soldier and a Canadian soldier who were captured in the process of the war and were sentenced to be shot by firing squad. But they were each given an opportunity to have a last wish,\" Sutherland said, measuring each word for dramatic effect.\n\n\"So the Brit asked for a cup of tea.

He was 88 years old.\n\nMore from TMZ:\n\nSutherland has more than 200 credits to his name, and a career that spanned five decades. In addition to 'M*A*S*H', he was in 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1978), 'Ordinary People' (1980), and 'JFK' (1991), a remake of 'The Italian Job' (2003), and 'Pride and Prejudice' (2005). He was the tyrannical President Snow in 'The Hunger Games' trilogy, and also made guest appearances on shows like 'The Simpsons' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'\n\nSon Kiefer Sutherland remembered his father on X:\n\nThe entire post reads:\n\nWith a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography; a funny, laconic, but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his break-through in 'The Dirty Dozen', and then on an incredible run in the 70's, 80's and beyond with 'M*A*S*H', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Little Murders', 'Klute', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Day Of The Locust', 'Ordinary People' and 'JFK', among many others.\n\nI even adore his very early appearances in 'Dr Terror's House Of Horrors' and 'The World Ten Times Over', as well as his very silly cameo in 'Kentucky Fried Movie'.\n\nI know many of you following me will feel the same way about this great screen legend's passing, so please list your favourite Donald Sutherland films.\n\nSo sorry to see you go Donald, but what a legacy you leave behind.\n\nIndeed it is.\n\nOne of this writer's favorite portrayals of Mr. Bennett.\n\nHe had a small role in 'Backdraft' but it made an impact.\n\nAs did his cameo in 'JFK'.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife, Francine Racette, five children (including actor Kiefer), and four grandchildren.

He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.\n\nOne of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.\n\nThese included a rascally Army surgeon in \"MAS*H\" (1970), a quirky tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), a small-town detective in \"Klute\" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in \"Animal House\" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978) and a despairing father in \"Ordinary People\" (1980).\n\nHe won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels.\n\n\"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017.\n\nSutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967).\n\nHe rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire \"MAS*H\" (1970). The film -- later spun off into a TV series -- depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era.\n\nAlso in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in \"Kelly's Heroes\" as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis.\n\nThe following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in \"Klute,\" and then in 1973 played a grieving father in \"Don't Look Now\" that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. \"Klute\" sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\nHis 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy \"Animal House,\" Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member.\n\n\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings.\n\nSutherland's performance in \"Ordinary People,\" Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture.\n\nSutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including \"JFK\" (1991), \"Backdraft\" (1991), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"A Time To Kill\" (1996) and \"Instinct\" (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie \"Citizen X.\"\n\nIn the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005).\n\nIn the \"Hunger Games\" films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he revelled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person -- always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said.\n\n\"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\"\n\nSutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles.

His son, Kiefer Sutherland, reported on his father's death \"[w]ith a heavy heart.\" He went on to refer to his father as \"one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.\" Donald Sutherland was a passionate artist whose career dates back to 1967's The Dirty Dozen and beyond.\n\nSutherland's striking presence and intensity helped earn two Golden Globes and an Emmy for his role as a Soviet official in Citizen X. With 140 film credits to his name, his career certainly didn't end there. The Dirty Dozen became the breakout hit that helped launch his career. It's his role as Doctor Hawkeye Pierce in the M*A*S*H film, however, that cemented his on-screen legacy. Sutherland was an inductee of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and his work on the HBO miniseries The Undoing won him a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries.\n\nYounger audiences may be most familiar with his work on The Hunger Games, The Italian Job, and Pride & Prejudice. That said, here are a few genres of cinema that Sutherland didn't touch. His filmography includes comedies and tragedies, demonstrating the actor's profound range.

He was 88.\n\nHis son, fellow actor Kiefer Sutherland, announced the news with a statement on X/Twitter on Thursday, which you can read in full below.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Donald Sutherland died in Miami on Thursday following a long illness.\n\nSutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and largely grew up there and in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, before moving to Britain to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There, he picked up a number of small British film and TV roles before truly getting his big breakthrough in Robert Aldrich's 1967 war film The Dirty Dozen.\n\nSome of his biggest roles would come in quick succession after that, starring in the 1970 M*A*S*H film as Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr. His other big roles in that prolific early '70s period include Kelly's Heroes (1970), Klute (1971), Don't Look Now (1973), and The Day of the Locust (1975). He also had a memorable part in John Landis' 1978 comedy classic Animal House.\n\nHe would continue to get steady work in the ensuing decades, starting the '80s with Robert Redford's directorial debut, the beloved 1980 drama Ordinary People, which would go onto score a Best Picture Oscar nomination. His other major film credits in the '80s and '90s include Eye of the Needle, A Dry White Season, Backdraft, JFK, Six Degrees of Separation, and Without Limits. In 2005, he starred alongside Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen in Pride & Prejudice.\n\nYounger generations, though, might know Sutherland best for his crucial role in The Hunger Games films, where he played the villainous President Snow. A younger version of the character was portrayed by Tom Blyth in last year's prequel film The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.\n\nOver the course of his career, Sutherland won a number of awards, including a Primetime Emmy, two Golden Globes, and a Critics Choice Award. In addition to Kiefer, Donald Sutherland is survived by three other sons, a daughter, his wife Francine Racette, and four grandchildren.\n\nImage credit: Carlos R.

No. 'Unattractive' -\n\nDonald Sutherland (L) listens to Italian director Federico Fellini during filming of 'Casanova' in Rome in 1976\n\nBorn on July 17, 1935 in New Brunswick, northeastern Canada, Donald Edward McNichol Sutherland was a sickly child, suffering from hepatitis, polio and rheumatic fever.\n\n\"One leg's a little shorter, but I survived,\" he told Esquire magazine in 2011.\n\nAs an adult, he shot up to 6 foot 3 inches (1.93 meters), but was long aware that not everyone would consider him handsome.\n\n\"Unattractive is a gentler way of putting it,\" he responded when asked by CBS whether he considered himself ugly.\n\nAfter working as a part-time DJ for local radio as a teenager, he graduated from the University of Toronto in drama and engineering.\n\nOpting to pursue the theater against the wishes of his parents, he moved to London when he was 22 and later to Scotland.\n\nDonald Sutherland (L) with his son Kiefer as the younger actor receives a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame in 2009\n\nHe appeared in his first feature in 1964, the Italian gothic horror \"The Castle of the Living Dead.\" Small television roles followed, including on cult British series such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint.\"\n\nHis breakthrough came in 1967, after he moved to Hollywood, with Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen\" in which he starred alongside Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson as part of a World War II unit of violent misfits fighting the Nazis.\n\nFour years later came the hugely successful \"M*A*S*H,\" a wildly irreverent comedy about a group of army doctors in the Korean War, directed by Robert Altman.\n\n- Jane Fonda partnership -\n\nDonald Sutherland in Berlin in 2015 at the world premiere of \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\"\n\nSutherland started dating Jane Fonda in the 1970s and they appeared together in Alan J. Pakula's \"Klute,\" for which Fonda won an Oscar and Golden Globe.\n\nIn 1972, the couple starred in an anti-Vietnam war documentary, \"F.T.A.\"\n\nSutherland then made around a film a year for a while, including a series of modern gems such as Nicolas Roeg's harrowing child abduction drama \"Don't Look Now\" (1973) and Oliver Stone's biopic \"JFK\" (1991).\n\nHe worked with a host of top-drawer directors, including Bernardo Bertolucci, Federico Fellini and Clint Eastwood.\n\n- 'Hunger Games' dictator -\n\nDonald Sutherland was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011\n\nIn his later decades, Sutherland was best known as the tyrannical Coriolanus Snow, ruling over the post-apocalyptic state Panem in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise beginning in 2012.\n\nHe once said he hoped the films would give youngsters hope for \"a decent future.\"\n\nSutherland, an Emmy and Golden Globe winner, received an honorary Oscar in 2017, although he was never nominated for a competitive Academy Award.\n\nHe was given a star on Hollywood's storied Walk of Fame in 2011, saying at the ceremony that the honor meant more to him than a fancy gravestone.\n\n\"Getting old,\" he said in Esquire in 2011, \"is like having a new profession, except it's not a profession of your own choosing.\"\n\nAnd death will be \"a lonely little journey,\" he said.\n\nSutherland left five

He brought iconic roles to the big screen for decades, starring in The Hunger Games, Pride & Prejudice and Klute. His agent confirmed that the late actor passed away after a long battle with illness.\n\nPenning a eulogy to his father in a written statement, Sutherland's son Kiefer stated, \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film.\"\n\nIn addition to his celebrated roles throughout the years, Kiefer also praised his father's inherent love for film, saying, \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nSutherland had begun his career working in television. After graduating from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, he was first known for taking on various roles on the small screen, starting with a bit role in the 1960s drama Studio 4 to television films such as The Sunshine Patriot.\n\nFrom there, Sutherland began his career in films such as The Dirty Dozen, starring as Pvt. Vernon Pinkley, as well as the film M*A*S*H as 'Hawkeye' Pierce. The latter of which would later be turned into the celebrated television series of the same name, with actor Alan Alda portraying Sutherland's role.\n\nAlthough such beloved roles were his mainstay, Sutherland's filmography wasn't strictly tied to one genre.

This role is a testament to Sutherland's ability to convey deep emotion while maintaining an enigmatic presence.\n\nSutherland's portrayal of Matthew Bennell in Philip Kaufman's sci-fi thriller is iconic. His performance is a masterclass in suspense and paranoia, capturing the terror of a small-town doctor who discovers his friends are being replaced by emotionless doppelg\u00e4ngers. This role solidified his reputation as a master of sci-fi and horror.\n\nAs President Snow, Sutherland brings chilling authority to the dystopian world of Panem. His portrayal of the tyrannical ruler, with a blend of charisma and menace, adds a profound layer of complexity to the series. Sutherland's performance is both compelling and terrifying, leaving an unforgettable mark on the franchise.\n\nDonald's career is a testament to his extraordinary talent and versatility. From the poignant depths of Ordinary People to the chilling malevolence of The Hunger Games, his roles continue to captivate and inspire audiences worldwide.

The veteran Canadian actor's death from a long illness was announced by his movie star son Kiefer Sutherland Thursday. He died in Miami, according to his talent agency CAA.\n\nNo further details were immediately available. Sutherland's career spanned over 60 years and he saw a resurgence with a younger audience in recent years thanks to his role as the evil President Snow in The Hunger Games franchise.\n\nThe Emmy and Golden Globe winner made a name for himself long before that, appearing on M*A*S*H, Klute and the 1970s horror movie Don't Look Now. Before transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s.\n\nThe tall and gaunt actor with a grin that could be sweet or diabolical was also known as the hippie tank commander in Kelly's Heroes and the stoned professor in Animal House. Over the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down -- but still eccentric -- parts in Robert Redford's Ordinary People and Oliver Stone's JFK.\n\nIn 2022, he appeared on what would be his last projects, Lawmen: Bass Reeves and Swimming With Sharks. The actor's memoir, Made Up, But Still True, was due out in November. Sutherland won an Emmy in 1995 for his role on Citizen X, and was nominated in 2006 for Human Trafficking, as reported by Variety.\n\nThe actor also won a Golden Globe for the miniseries Citizen X and for the television movie Path to War. In 2017 he received an Honorary Award from the Academy. His first American film was 'The Dirty Dozen' in 1967, in which he played Vernon Pinkley. Sutherland's breakout role came in the 1970's comedy smash hit M*A*S*H, which turned him into a major Hollywood star.\n\nThe actor starred alongside Jane Fonda in 1971's Klute, his first role as a romantic lead. Fonda won the Oscar for best actress for her work on the film, and credited Sutherland for her award. The two had been in a romantic relationship while filming, and he became involved in antiwar activism at the time.\n\nHer and Fonda put together a traveling revue called FTA - Free the Army, popularly known as [Expletive] the Army. The FBI put them both under surveillance, per Variety. Sutherland is survived by Keith and his twin sister Rachel from his marriage to ex-wife Shirley Douglas. Having been married in 1966, he and Douglas divorced in 1971.\n\nIn 1974, the actor began living with actress Francine Racette, with whom he remained ever after. They had three children: Roeg, born in 1974 and named after the director Nicolas Roeg (Don't Look Now); Rossif, born in 1978 and named after the director Frederick Rossif; and Angus Redford, born in 1979 and named after Robert Redford. Sutherland also leaves behind four grandchildren.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He was 88.\n\nFor younger movie-goers, Mr. Sutherland is likely known for two achievements - being the father of Kiefer Sutherland, star of the hugely popular, long-running (2001-2010) television series 24 and, beginning in 2012, playing the nefarious President Snow in The Hunger Games movie franchise.\n\nFor baby-boomers, however, Mr. Sutherland will be remembered for the indelible performances he delivered in the 1970s, '80s and '90s for directors as varied and esteemed as Robert Altman, Bernardo Bertolucci, John Schlesinger, Robert Redford and Federico Fellini.\n\nAmazingly, Mr. Sutherland never received an Oscar nomination in a career encompassing more than 140 feature films. A list of some of Mr. Sutherland's roles and the movies in which he appeared is sufficient, certainly among fans, to conjure his talent, range and charisma. They include the rascally Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H (1970), the anguished detective in Klute (1971) and the doomed architectural restorer in Don't Look Now (1973), the last especially memorable for the passionate love-making scene between the actor and co-star Julie Christie. Also noteworthy: his Attila the demented fascist in 1900 (1975), the caddish, dope-smoking professor in 1978's National Lampoon's Animal House, Calvin Jarrett, the grieving father of Ordinary People (1980), the ruthless German agent in Eye of the Needle (1981) and Flan Kittredge, the snobbish New York art dealer from Six Degrees of Separation (1993).\n\nSix feet, four inches in height with piercing blue eyes, a rumbly voice, a winning smile that could go from devilish to impish to bashful, and a face his mother once described as more \"interesting\" than handsome, Mr. Sutherland was a distinctive, often commanding presence. As Maclean's observed in 2000, \"he cannot walk down the street without being recognized, here in Canada and most of the rest of the world.\" Yet this distinctiveness, on film at least, was chameleonic, allowing him to play handsome (Don't Look Now) and disturbed (The Day of the Locust, 1975), leads (Fellini Casanova, 1976) and cameos (Oliver Stone's JFK, 1991).\n\n\"I love the characters I play,\" he told an interviewer in 2008, \"and I try to learn more about the human condition when I play them. No matter who they are, I always try to inform them and given them as much of my own observations and truth and morality and immorality and poetry as I can.\"\n\nMr. Sutherland's Canadian connections were many and abiding. Although he lived mostly in France, California (eventually forsaken \"because I couldn't stand it there\") and Florida, he kept both his Canadian citizenship and a home in Georgeville in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. All three of his wives, with whom he had a total of five children, were Canadian. Shirley Douglas, one of the two daughters of CCF/NDP stalwart Tommy Douglas, was Mr. Sutherland's second wife (1966-1970) and, in 1966, the mother of Kiefer and twin sister Rachel.\n\nMr. Sutherland was named an officer of the Order of Canada in 1978 and in 2000 received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. In 2009, CTV hired him as the voice of its promotional commercials for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Later, Mr. Sutherland helped carry the Olympic flag into BC Place during the opening ceremony. The actor also starred in several Canadian productions, most notably playing Dr. Norman Bethune in the 1977 CBC-TV drama of the same name and again in 1990 in Philip Borsos's Bethune: The Making of a Hero. In the early 1970s, he met Francine Racette, the woman who would become his third wife, on the set of Alien Thunder in which Mr. Sutherland played a Mountie. The couple would go on to have three sons - Roeg, Rossif and Angus Redford, each named after a director Mr. Sutherland had worked with. In 1983 his performance in Threshold as cardiac surgeon determined to implant the first self-sustaining artificial human heart won him a best-actor Genie.\n\nHe was born Donald McNichol Sutherland in Saint John, N.B. on July 17, 1935, the son of a salesman and a mathematics teacher, and spent most of his childhood and adolescence in Bridgewater, N.S. He was reportedly a sickly child, battling polio and rheumatic fever. As a teen, he worked part-time in a radio station. Early on, he thought he might like to be a sculptor. But by age 11, as he told Charlie Rose in a 1998 interview, \"I wanted to be an actor\" - a calling sparked, he recalled later, by seeing David Lean's film adaptation of Charles Dickens's Great Expectations. His father, however, urged him to \"have something to fall back on,\" and in the early 1950s he enrolled as an engineering student at the University of Toronto.\n\nWhile there, Mr. Sutherland acted in student productions at Hart House and before long quit engineering to major in English. A positive review of his performance as Stephano in Shakespeare's The Tempest by Globe and Mail critic Herbert Whittaker (\"a spark of talent illumines the stage\") convinced Mr. Sutherland to try his hand at professional acting. He travelled to London to attend the Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. It was not a happy experience - the school's legendary voice instructor, Iris Warren, \"said I should drive a truck,\" he told Mr. Rose - and he left after a year. Before long, however, he was scoring parts on stage and in television and film in the U.K.\n\nMr. Sutherland's first foray into Hollywood movies occurred in 1965 when Columbia Pictures decided to shoot its Cold War thriller The Bedford Incident at Shepperton Studios, London. Cast as a sailor, Mr. Sutherland spent most of the movie, which starred Richard Widmark, in the sick-bay of the destroyer U.S.S. Bedford. Still, he had his foot in the hatch. A year later, he was cast as Vernon Pinkley, one of the dirty dozen in Robert Aldrich's acclaimed Second World War drama of the same name. Again, it was a small part (\"I was one of the bottom six,\" he told an interviewer) and hardly edifying - Mr. Sutherland was a dopey, gaunt-looking psychopath sentenced to 30 years in prison - but he made the most of it. Fame was clinched in 1970 with his star turn in Altman's M*A*S*H. Playing a surgeon in a mobile medical unit during the Korean War, Mr. Sutherland, as one critic observed, wowed audiences with his \"nonchalant disregard for authority and a moral outrage that articulated the disillusionment of the anti-Vietnam War movement.\"\n\nIt wasn't entirely an act. In 1971, along with then-lover Jane Fonda (he'd starred opposite her in Klute, for which she won an Oscar), Mr. Sutherland joined the Free Theater Associates on a tour of coffee houses near U.S. army bases. One of his jobs in this anti-war cabaret was to read from Johnny Got His Gun, Dalton Trumbo's famous 1939 novel about a First World War soldier who discovers he's lost his arms, legs and face but whose brain remains fully functioning. (Mr. Sutherland went on to do a cameo as Christ for the film adaptation.)\n\nThirty-four years later, while appearing as the Speaker of the House in the NBC-TV political drama series Commander-in-Chief, a BBC interviewer asked Mr. Sutherland for his views on George W. Bush's Republican administration. \"They were inept,\" Mr. Sutherland replied, referring to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. \"They were inadequate to the task and they lied.\" As for Iraq, \"they do not care about Iraqi people,\" Mr. Sutherland opined. \"They do not care about the families of dead soldiers. They only care about profit.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Sutherland never seemed to lack for work nor saw his interest in performing slacken. Often he would swerve into interesting nooks and crannies. In 2000, for instance, he chose to end an almost-20-year hiatus from the stage by appearing at Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in a six-week run of Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's Enigma Variations. The play was translated from the French by Mr. Sutherland's then-26-year-old son, Roeg, and produced by his wife Francine. In 1985, he appeared as Kate Bush's father, an eccentric, persecuted scientist loosely based on the real Wilhelm Reich, in the video of her hit song, Cloudbursting. A few years before this, he narrated the diaries of Dr. Ben Wheeler for a feature documentary, A War Story, directed by Dr. Wheeler's then-Edmonton-based daughter, Anne.\n\nOne thing Donald Sutherland did not do was direct films. \"I wouldn't know how to direct,\" he once told The Globe and Mail's Michael Posner. \"I don't have that talent. I work from the inside out.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But for every juicy villain role, there was a corresponding film, like \"Ordinary People\" or \"Pride and Prejudice,\" where the depth of his compassion as a father nearly took your breath away.\n\nHere are his 10 most iconic roles we will remember him by.\n\nIf \"The Dirty Dozen,\" released in 1967, put Sutherland on the map, then \"M*A*S*H\" cemented his place as one of the most important and impressive actors of his generation. In Robert Altman's masterpiece, which won the Palme d'Or and was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture), Sutherland plays \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, a surgeon serving in a makeshift hospital in South Korea during the war. The tone of \"M*A*S*H\" is decidedly anarchic, veering from wild comedy to sober interludes and back again, with Sutherland and Elliot Gould (as surgeon \"Duke\") leading the charge. When Gould protests about missing olives in their martinis, Sutherland coyly responds, \"We do have to make certain concessions, we're three miles from the front line.\" (On the massively popular television series that followed, the character would be played by Alan Alda.) At 35, \"M*A*S*H\" had made Sutherland a massive movie star. - Drew Taylor\n\nOstensibly a remake of Don Siegel's 1956 movie \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and once again based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel \"The Body Snatchers,\" Philip Kaufman's 1978 film is a perfect film, amplifying the unease and distrust of the 1970s with a niftily timeless sci-fi horror concept. Sutherland plays a San Francisco Health Department employee who starts to uncover the fact that normal people are being replaced by \"pod people\" - a race of evil alien doppelg\u00e4ngers. The whip smart script by W.D. Richter incorporates a number of era-specific flourishes - bath houses, a New Age guru played (with aplomb) by Leonard Nimoy, and the idea that being reborn as a new person is a spiritual conversion as much as it is an actual, physical one. Sutherland often played more straight-laced characters guiding audiences through a more fantastical world, which is definitely the case here, as a no-nonsense government employee trying to make sense of a quietly insidious extraterrestrial assault. It's his steadfastness, too, that makes the ending all the more tragic when - spoiler alert for a movie that came out 46 years ago - it's revealed that he too has been replaced by a malevolent double. Now there's no stopping those dastardly aliens! For a story that has been remade countless times, the 1978 version, anchored by Sutherland's outstanding performance, is clearly the best of the bunch. And if you want even more Sutherland-related alien invasion fun, check out \"The Puppet Masters,\" a 1994 thriller where he battles a race of alien slugs that control people, based on a 1951 novel by Robert Heinlein. It's way less classy but a total hoot. - Drew Taylor\n\nIf, for some reason, you've never seen \"Don't Look Now,\" use Sutherland's passing as an excuse to give it a watch. (Criterion recently released a beautiful 4K disc.) Directed by former cinematographer Nicolas Roeg and based on a short story by \"Rebecca\" author Daphne du Maurier, Sutherland plays a man who has just lost his daughter in a tragic accident. (The movie opens with an artful, lump-in-your-throat tragedy and doesn't let up.) Shortly afterwards he takes a job restoring an ancient church in Venice and brings his wife (Julie Christie). He thinks it'll be good for them. Or at least give them an opportunity to mourn in a new place. And as they are there, they are confronted with a series of strange, paranormal occurrences, including a psychic informing Christie that she can communicate with their dead daughter. There's also a serial killer on the loose wearing a red rain slicker not unlike the one that their daughter died in. Sutherland, in some ways, has the more difficult role, since he is the one that is more outwardly straight and unaffected. But inside of the character is a sea of roiling emotion, as is evidenced in the now-classic sex scene that Roeg intercuts with Christie and Sutherland getting ready to go out - the mundane mixed with the carnal. (It's regularly regarded as one of the greatest sex scenes of all time and not just because of persistent rumors that it was not simulated.) In the end, it's Sutherland who has to make sense of the madness that has consumed him. Oh and it's one of the scariest movies ever too. The making of the movie clearly had an impact on Sutherland; he named one of his children Roeg. What a picture. - Drew Taylor\n\nJane Fonda won her first Best Actress Oscar for her role as a call girl Bree Daniels who needs protection from a stalker, but there's a reason the film is named for Sutherland's character: He's the quiet, steady backbone of the movie as he navigates his duties as a cop with his personal feelings for Bree.\n\nIn 1977 Sutherland had a small role in John Landis' anthology sketch movie \"The Kentucky Fried Movie,\" which was written by the team behind \"Airplane,\" Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. Based on his work on \"The Kentucky Fried Movie,\" Landis was recommended to direct Universal's \"Animal House.\" (The National Lampoon branding came from producer Matty Simmons and the fact that it was based on stories written by co-writer Chris Miller for the humor magazine.) Landis took Sutherland with him, assigning him the role of Professor Dave Jennings. Jennings was a perfect Sutherland character - square but sexy, un-intimidating but wielding power, hip but aloof - a professor who beds a young co-ed (played by Karen Allen) and, in a particularly memorable scene, shares a joint with his nervous students. When one of the kids (played by Tom Hulce) asks him, \"I won't go schizo, will I?\" Sutherland purrs back, \"It's a distinct possibility.\" Sutherland was as nimble and gifted a comedian as he was a dramatic actor and able to make even the smallest parts seem rich and expansive. - Drew Taylor\n\nFew actors can show up for a single scene and command the entire movie, especially if the movie that they're in is so chock full of stars that it might as well have been the 1994 opening of Planet Hollywood's Orlando location. But that's exactly what Donald Sutherland does in Oliver Stone's sprawling masterpiece \"JFK.\" He pops up as X, a mysterious informant who walks Kevin Costner's New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison through the intelligence community's response to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The sequence is framed by Sutherland and Costner walking around a rainy Washington, D.C., backed by John Williams' propulsive and often imitated score, is basically a monologue (Costner is nervously taking notes the whole time and only occasionally asking a stray question), putting all of the peculiarities of the murder into historical and political context. It's hypnotic, especially backed by Stone's unique editorial style. You remain on the edge of your seat as Sutherland attempts to straighten the knotty, cursive conspiracy narrative. Maybe it was his history in conspiracy classics like \"Klute\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" that made him so perfect for the role; it's undeniable that at this point in his career he had become an elder statesman. But there's also nobody that could have delivered lines like \"That's the real question, isn't it - why? The how and the who is just scenery for the public. Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefitted? And who has the power to cover it?\" and have it really mean something. Chances are if you think about \"JFK,\" a three-hour historical thriller filled with some of the best performers of the time, you're going to think about one sequence - Sutherland's sequence. - Drew Taylor\n\nMary Tyler Moore and Judd Hirsch were nominated for their roles i Robert Redford's Best Picture winner and Timothy Hutton deservedly won Best Supporting Actor for his performance as suicidal, guilt-ridden survivor Conrad Jarrett, who blames himself for his brother's accidental death. But the glue holding the film together is Sutherland, who realizes he's utterly out of his depth with both his wife and his remaining son, who have become something like enemies. If you've only seen Sutherland play villains, this is the movie to start with to showcase what a versatile, complex and caring actor he was.\n\nIn this thriller, based on the novel by Ken Follett, Sutherland is dashing and deadly as a Nazi spy whose mission is compromised when he falls for a beautiful, lonely -- and surprisingly resourceful -- Englishwoman, played byKate Nelligan. One of his most underrated roles.\n\nAs the father of a house full of girls, Mr. Bennet mostly sits back and lets the chaos happen, leaving his wife to deal with the particulars of finding husbands for all of their daughters.\n\nWwhen Lizzie (Keira Knightley) rejects a potential suitor because she doesn't love him, he reveals not only that she's his favorite, but that he doesn't give a damn about following the expectations of his wife, or society.\n\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth,\" he tells her. \"From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "drew_taylor@thewrap.com", "name": "Drew Taylor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sharon_knolle@thewrap.com", "name": "Sharon Knolle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Snatchers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Body Snatchers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Roeg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Alda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Richter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W.

He was 88.\n\nSutherland's body of work showcased his transformative range, shifting comfortably from drama to comedy and bouncing between heavier and lighter roles with ease. Tall at 6-foot-4 with shock white hair and piercing blue eyes, he was difficult to miss whether he was playing a zany oddball, an icy tyrant or a sadistic villain. In all, he had nearly 200 film or television roles.\n\n\"It's characters who make pictures,\" he told The Times in 1995. \"Essentially my job is to provide information about them.\"\n\nDeep in his career, as he shifted between leading and character parts, Sutherland thrived in smaller roles that ordinarily called for an older actor who'd long ago been typecast as a villain or a kooky sidekick. But Sutherland had the winning ability to transform those small roles into complex characters who often helped elevate the film.\n\nOn the small screen, Sutherland also appeared in \"Human Trafficking,\" \"Commander in Chief,\" \"Dirty Sexy Money,\" \"Pillars of the Earth\" and \"Trust.\" Though he originally intended to be a theatrical actor, his only Broadway appearance was in Edward Albee's short-lived adaptation of \"Lolita\" in 1981.\n\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born in St. John, a small fishing village in New Brunswick, Canada, on July 17, 1935. The town had only 5,000 residents, he said, and \"that was when the train rolled into town.\" One of four children, his mother was a mathematician and his father was a salesman.\n\nInitially, he planned to be an engineer and attended Victoria College in Toronto, where he earned a degree in engineering and drama. It was also where he met his first wife, Lois Hardwick. His love of acting began in a Nova Scotia movie theater when he was a teen, but movie-acting seemed too lofty a pursuit, so he tried his luck in theater instead.\n\n\"It's not that theater was my first love. My first love was just to be an actor,\" he told The Times. \"I was kind of dumb and cowish, and I didn't think movies were something I could ever be part of. I don't know why I presumed that the theater would be. It was more ordinary, I suppose.\"\n\nHe moved to England in 1956 to study acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art but dropped out after nine months because he disliked its psychological approach to acting. He went on to tour with various repertory companies and appeared in several BBC television productions, including bit parts in \"The Saint\" and \"The Avengers.\"\n\nRejection became all-too familiar. When he tried to break onto the big screen in 1962, he came away thinking his audition had gone well. The next morning the director phoned him. \"The role we're casting is that of a guy who lives next door,\" the director said. \"You don't look like you've ever lived next door to anyone.\"\n\nHe finally made his first movie, \"The Castle of the Living Dead,\" in 1964 and followed it with a series of undistinguished films such as \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\" and \"Die! Die! My Darling!\" His break came when he arrived in Hollywood in 1967, a year after his first marriage ended, to co-star in the 1968 thriller \"The Split.\"\n\n\"We had no money,\" said Sutherland, who by then was married to his second wife, actress Shirley Douglas. (They divorced in 1970). So he called his \"Oedipus the King\" co-star Christopher Plummer of \"Sound of Music\" fame, who was working in Stratford, Canada, to get his input.\n\n\"I woke him up,\" Sutherland told The Times in 2011. \"He loaned me $1,500. Incredible. We were on a Boeing 707 -- Shirley, her son Tom. Kiefer and [his twin] Rachel were probably 3 or 4 months old. I had a raincoat on and I was holding Kiefer, and when we landed in Los Angeles, he threw up all over me.\"\n\nThe actor used a clip of his appearance on \"The Saint\" to land a role in his first major American film, \"The Dirty Dozen,\" in 1967. Sutherland credited legendary producer Ingo Preminger and director Robert Aldrich, who oversaw the 1967 World War II flick, for landing his later role in the film \"MASH.\"\n\n\"I was a glorified extra\" in \"The Dirty Dozen,\" Sutherland said. \"They hired legitimate actors to play the bottom six of the dozen.\"\n\nBut he quickly rose to fame in 1970 as the cocky surgeon Capt. Hawkeye Pierce in \"MASH\" and then as the neurotic platoon commander Oddball in \"Kelly's Heroes.\" He went on to appear in such seminal films as Alan J. Pakula's mystery \"Klute,\" Bernardo Bertolucci's epic \"1900\" and Federico Fellini's \"Casanova.\"\n\nThe plum roles continued to roll in with \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"The Day of the Locust,\" and the 1973 occult thriller \"Don't Look Now,\" which stirred controversy for a sex scene with Sutherland and Julie Christie that was unusually graphic for its time.\n\nAfter being a leading man through most of the 1970s, Sutherland began alternating between leading roles in films such as \"A Dry White Season\" with Marlon Brando and Robert Redford's Oscar-winning \"Ordinary People\" and character roles in films such as \"JFK\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nHe also appeared in lesser films that, nonetheless, became cult favorites, such as National Lampoon's \"Animal House,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nDespite his lengthy resume, Sutherland had a dearth of accolades, winning but a few major acting awards for his performances -- an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the 1995 miniseries \"Citizen X\" and another Globe for 2002's \"Path to War.\" But the lack of award season hardware didn't seem to trouble him.\n\n\"My career has been all downhill since the age of 11. I did my first play, 'The Male Animal,' at Toronto University's Hart House theater. The audience laughed and applauded when I came on, they applauded when I went off, and they applauded when I came on again. I've never had it as good since,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017 he was given an honorary Oscar, which recognizes extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement and exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences.\n\nThe actor's short-lived romance with Jane Fonda after making \"Klute\" in 1971 introduced him to left-wing politics and a second career as a hard-charging activist. The two had met at a Black Panther Party benefit in Los Angeles where he voiced his opposition of the Vietnam War. Sutherland, Fonda and other antiwar activists went on to form the Free Theatre Associates as an alternative to Bob Hope's USO tours in Vietnam. Documents declassified in 2017 revealed the CIA had placed him on a watch list because of his antiwar activities.\n\nWatching his father's seminal films were a revelation for Kiefer Sutherland, who came to appreciate his father's body of work as a teenager. \"I knew he was a famous actor, but I didn't know how prolific he was. I didn't know how diverse all of those characters were. The younger Sutherland, best known for his leading role in the television drama \"24,\" said he even called his father to apologize for not knowing the magnitude of his career.\n\nThe two Sutherlands both appeared in Joel Schumacher's 1996 thriller \"A Time to Kill,\" but they did not share any scenes. That changed when they played an estranged father and son in the western \"Forsaken\" in 2015.\n\nSutherland said he generally didn't watch his films after they were released, but when he did, he said he noticed room for improvement.\n\n\"I have to be truthful -- I am still looking forward when I look back. All I see are mistakes,\" he told The Times. \"When you are working on a picture, all of your concentration, all of your intensity is directed toward the heart of it, to such a degree it burns inside of you. Then after it's over, it's gone.\"\n\nSutherland is survived by wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren, including \"Veep\" actress Sarah Sutherland.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type":

He was 88.\n\nKnown for his easily identifiable baritone, Sutherland starred in a multitude of recognizable and memorable films, including 1980's Ordinary People, 1991's JFK, 1998's Without Limits and the Hunger Games franchise. He also played the lovable Hawkeye in the movie version of M*A*S*H*. He did a lot of TV work as well, appearing on shows like Lawmen: Bass Reeves, The Simpsons, Dirty Sexy Money and Commander in Chief, among many others.\n\nHis career in the industry spanned nearly seven decades, a truly remarkable feat for a Canadian actor.\n\nBorn Donald McNichol Sutherland on July 17, 1935 in Saint John, N.B., the future thespian was a rather sickly child. He battled and overcame multiple bouts of illness, surviving polio, rheumatic fever and hepatitis. According to Biography, the first word he learned to say was \"neck\" because that's where he felt his pain. As a result of the polio, one of his legs was permanently shorter than the other.\n\nArmed with a perfect broadcast voice, Sutherland landed his first job (at the age of 14) as a news correspondent at a local radio station. That didn't really lead anywhere, however, and he went on to get a degree in Engineering and Drama from the University of Toronto. Eventually, the \"drama\" side won him over and he left Canada for the U.K. in 1957 to pursue studies at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\n\nFrom there, he spent a year-and-a-half at the Perth Repertory Theatre in Scotland, after which he started to win roles on British TV shows and movies.\n\n\"My first offer ever for a film was in 1962,\" Sutherland said to GQ magazine. \"I auditioned for the producer, the writer, the director. And I came home and said to my first wife, 'I thought it went OK.' You never want to say you did well before you know anything. The next morning they were all on the phone saying how wonderful the audition had been. And then the producer said, 'We loved you so much, we wanted to explain why we weren't casting you. We've always thought of this as a guy-next-door sort of character and we don't think you look like you've ever lived next-door to anybody.'\"\n\n\"I remember going up to the theatre in New York at 11 a.m. on the first day M*A*S*H opened,\" Sutherland said to Esquire. \"These were the days before advertising, and the only word of mouth was from one screening in San Francisco two months earlier. We went to the theatre early to see if it was going to sell any tickets. The line was twice around the block.\"\n\nAs Hawkeye, Sutherland was front-and-centre, and it helped lead to another \"war\" role, this time as tank commander Oddball in Kelly's Heroes. (Sutherland's M*A*S*H* character was recast on TV with Alan Alda.)\n\nThroughout the '70s, Sutherland's career trajectory only went up. The combination of his voice, his height (6'4'') and his versatility helped him secure a variety of different projects without being typecast to a certain genre. He was one of the leads in dozens of productions like The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) and Federico Fellini's Casanova (1976), all very dissimilar from one another.\n\nThings were a bit quieter for the star through the mid-to-late '80s, but he was still appearing in at least one production a year. By the time the '90s rolled around, he was back into big-name movies like 1991's Backdraft and JFK, 1993's Six Degrees of Separation and 1995's Outbreak.\n\nAge didn't slow Sutherland down in the 2000s either; recent moviegoing audiences probably know him best as President Snow in The Hunger Games franchise, but he's been in many films since the turn of the century. Among them are Cold Mountain and The Italian Job remake, both released in 2003. As of 2016, he worked in more than 150 movies.\n\n\"I'm going to be working until I'm helping them with the shovel,\" he said.\n\nHe provided voiceovers and narration for TV commercials during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, and was also one of the flag bearers for Canada at the Opening Ceremony. An internationally respected actor, he was also a member of the main competition jury at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSutherland was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1978 and was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2000.

Justin Timberlake's commercial about drinking goes viral after DWI arrest\n\nDonald Sutherland, the prolific Canadian actor known for his roles in \"M.A.S.H.\" and \"The Hunger Games,\" has passed away at the age of 88. His son, Kiefer Sutherland, confirmed the news, expressing profound admiration for his father's illustrious career. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Kiefer remarked, highlighting his father's passion and dedication to his craft. No further details were immediately available.\n\nSutherland's career spanned over five decades, marked by a variety of roles that showcased his versatility and talent. From his early days playing offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in \"M.A.S.H.\" to his more recent portrayal of President Snow in \"The Hunger Games,\" Sutherland left an indelible mark on cinema. His performances were often characterized by a unique blend of charm and intensity, making him a beloved figure in both mainstream and independent films.\n\nIn the 1970s, Sutherland epitomized the era's antiestablishment cinema with roles in films like \"Klute\" and \"Don't Look Now.\" His ability to transition seamlessly between different genres and characters was evident in his performances in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" Reflecting on his career, Sutherland once told Charlie Rose, \"I love to feel my hand fit into the glove of some other character. I feel a huge freedom - time stops for me.\"\n\nDespite his success, Sutherland often made unconventional career choices, which sometimes led to mixed results. He turned down roles in \"Deliverance\" and \"Straw Dogs\" in favor of projects like \"Alex in Wonderland\" and \"Johnny Got His Gun.\" Nonetheless, his talent and dedication never wavered, earning him an honorary Oscar in 2017 for his contributions to the film industry.\n\nSutherland's impact extended beyond the screen. He was actively involved in political causes, particularly during the Vietnam War, where he supported Vietnam Veterans Against the War alongside Jane Fonda. This activism reflected his commitment to using his platform for greater societal good.\n\nIn recent years, Sutherland continued to captivate audiences with roles in \"The Undoing,\" \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves,\" and \"Swimming With Sharks.\" His portrayal of complex characters, such as J. Paul Getty in \"Trust\" and roles in films like \"Ad Astra\" and \"The Burnt-Orange Heresy,\" showcased his enduring talent and adaptability.\n\nSutherland's passing marks the end of an era, but his legacy will live on through his extensive body of work and the profound impact he had on the film industry. He is survived by his wife, Francine Racette, their sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren. The family plans a private celebration of his life, honoring the remarkable journey of an actor who truly loved what he did.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Timberlake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Redford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Sutherland has five children who are all involved in the film industry in some capacity. Most famous is \"24\" star Kiefer, while his younger brother Rossif has been in more than three dozen films and was nominated for Genie, ACTRA and Canadian Screen Awards. Sutherland is married to French-Canadian actress Francine Racette and was previously married to actresses Shirley Douglas and Lois Hardwick.\n\nNotable works and awards: Sutherland has appeared in more than 140 films, including \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"Cold Mountain\" and \"The Hunger Games\" series. He also has extensive TV credits and awards for his work, including best supporting actor Golden Globes for \"Citizen X\" in 1996 and \"Path to War\" in 2003 and a best actor in a miniseries or movie Emmy for \"Human Trafficking\" in 2005. He received an honorary Academy Award in 2017.\n\nQuote: While he's been based in the U.S. for most of his career, Sutherland said he hated to leave Canada and missed his East Coast roots. In 2015, he produced, co-wrote and voiced the lead character for the Nova Scotia-set animated film \"Pirate's Passage,\" based on William Gilkerson's book of the same name. He hoped families would watch it together and reflect on Canada's history.\n\n\"People in Canada, we've lost something, we've lost something, and I hate that we've lost it,\" said Sutherland. \"This maybe will remind people of why our country is so important and that we cannot try to become a clone of some other country.\n\n\"We have to be who we are, and who we are is who we were, not who we are now.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [],

The \"24\" and \"The Lost Boys\" actor remembered his father as a performer who loved his craft and an actor who was one of Hollywood's most important stars.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" Donald wrote in a statement on his social media platforms. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film.

Kiefer followed in his father's footsteps as an actor, and the father-son duo starred together in projects several times throughout the years, including the movies \"Max Dugan Returns\" (1983), \"Forsaken\" (2015) and \"A Time to Kill\" (1996).\n\nDonald became a countercultural icon as an actor after appearing in movies such as \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"MASH,\" \"Klute\" and \"Don't Look Now.\" He later connected to a younger generation of moviegoers by starring opposite Jennifer Lawrence as President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise.

But for every juicy villain role, there was a corresponding film, like \"Ordinary People\" or \"Pride and Prejudice,\" where the depth of his compassion as a father nearly took your breath away.\n\nHere are his 10 most iconic roles we will remember him by.\n\nWho else but Sutherland could be as imperious and as cruel in the role of a dictator who orchestrates the death of dozens of children every year? And yet, despite the withering coldness, there is still a wicked sense of humor at the very end as Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) finds a different target for her arrow. The mob he once ruled over takes care of Snow, but we'll never forget his bitter laugh that fate -- just like the odds -- can sometimes be in your favor.\n\nIf \"The Dirty Dozen,\" released in 1967, put Sutherland on the map, then \"M*A*S*H\" cemented his place as one of the most important and impressive actors of his generation. In Robert Altman's masterpiece, which won the Palme d'Or and was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture), Sutherland plays \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, a surgeon serving in a makeshift hospital in South Korea during the war. The tone of \"M*A*S*H\" is decidedly anarchic, veering from wild comedy to sober interludes and back again, with Sutherland and Elliot Gould (as surgeon \"Duke\") leading the charge. When Gould protests about missing olives in their martinis, Sutherland coyly responds, \"We do have to make certain concessions, we're three miles from the front line.\" (On the massively popular television series that followed, the character would be played by Alan Alda.) At 35, \"M*A*S*H\" had made Sutherland a massive movie star. - Drew Taylor\n\nOstensibly a remake of Don Siegel's 1956 movie \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" and once again based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel \"The Body Snatchers,\" Philip Kaufman's 1978 film is a perfect film, amplifying the unease and distrust of the 1970s with a niftily timeless sci-fi horror concept. Sutherland plays a San Francisco Health Department employee who starts to uncover the fact that normal people are being replaced by \"pod people\" - a race of evil alien doppelg\u00e4ngers. The whip smart script by W.D. Richter incorporates a number of era-specific flourishes - bath houses, a New Age guru played (with aplomb) by Leonard Nimoy, and the idea that being reborn as a new person is a spiritual conversion as much as it is an actual, physical one. Sutherland often played more straight-laced characters guiding audiences through a more fantastical world, which is definitely the case here, as a no-nonsense government employee trying to make sense of a quietly insidious extraterrestrial assault. It's his steadfastness, too, that makes the ending all the more tragic when - spoiler alert for a movie that came out 46 years ago - it's revealed that he too has been replaced by a malevolent double. Now there's no stopping those dastardly aliens! For a story that has been remade countless times, the 1978 version, anchored by Sutherland's outstanding performance, is clearly the best of the bunch. And if you want even more Sutherland-related alien invasion fun, check out \"The Puppet Masters,\" a 1994 thriller where he battles a race of alien slugs that control people, based on a 1951 novel by Robert Heinlein. It's way less classy but a total hoot. - Drew Taylor\n\nIf, for some reason, you've never seen \"Don't Look Now,\" use Sutherland's passing as an excuse to give it a watch. (Criterion recently released a beautiful 4K disc.) Directed by former cinematographer Nicolas Roeg and based on a short story by \"Rebecca\" author Daphne du Maurier, Sutherland plays a man who has just lost his daughter in a tragic accident. (The movie opens with an artful, lump-in-your-throat tragedy and doesn't let up.) Shortly afterwards he takes a job restoring an ancient church in Venice and brings his wife (Julie Christie). He thinks it'll be good for them. Or at least give them an opportunity to mourn in a new place. And as they are there, they are confronted with a series of strange, paranormal occurrences, including a psychic informing Christie that she can communicate with their dead daughter. There's also a serial killer on the loose wearing a red rain slicker not unlike the one that their daughter died in. Sutherland, in some ways, has the more difficult role, since he is the one that is more outwardly straight and unaffected. But inside of the character is a sea of roiling emotion, as is evidenced in the now-classic sex scene that Roeg intercuts with Christie and Sutherland getting ready to go out - the mundane mixed with the carnal. (It's regularly regarded as one of the greatest sex scenes of all time and not just because of persistent rumors that it was not simulated.) In the end, it's Sutherland who has to make sense of the madness that has consumed him. Oh and it's one of the scariest movies ever too. The making of the movie clearly had an impact on Sutherland; he named one of his children Roeg. What a picture. - Drew Taylor\n\nJane Fonda won her first Best Actress Oscar for her role as a call girl Bree Daniels who needs protection from a stalker, but there's a reason the film is named for Sutherland's character: He's the quiet, steady backbone of the movie as he navigates his duties as a cop with his personal feelings for Bree.\n\nIn 1977 Sutherland had a small role in John Landis' anthology sketch movie \"The Kentucky Fried Movie,\" which was written by the team behind \"Airplane,\" Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. Based on his work on \"The Kentucky Fried Movie,\" Landis was recommended to direct Universal's \"Animal House.\" (The National Lampoon branding came from producer Matty Simmons and the fact that it was based on stories written by co-writer Chris Miller for the humor magazine.) Landis took Sutherland with him, assigning him the role of Professor Dave Jennings. Jennings was a perfect Sutherland character - square but sexy, un-intimidating but wielding power, hip but aloof - a professor who beds a young co-ed (played by Karen Allen) and, in a particularly memorable scene, shares a joint with his nervous students. When one of the kids (played by Tom Hulce) asks him, \"I won't go schizo, will I?\" Sutherland purrs back, \"It's a distinct possibility.\" Sutherland was as nimble and gifted a comedian as he was a dramatic actor and able to make even the smallest parts seem rich and expansive. - Drew Taylor\n\nFew actors can show up for a single scene and command the entire movie, especially if the movie that they're in is so chock full of stars that it might as well have been the 1994 opening of Planet Hollywood's Orlando location. But that's exactly what Donald Sutherland does in Oliver Stone's sprawling masterpiece \"JFK.\" He pops up as X, a mysterious informant who walks Kevin Costner's New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison through the intelligence community's response to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The sequence is framed by Sutherland and Costner walking around a rainy Washington, D.C., backed by John Williams' propulsive and often imitated score, is basically a monologue (Costner is nervously taking notes the whole time and only occasionally asking a stray question), putting all of the peculiarities of the murder into historical and political context. It's hypnotic, especially backed by Stone's unique editorial style. You remain on the edge of your seat as Sutherland attempts to straighten the knotty, cursive conspiracy narrative. Maybe it was his history in conspiracy classics like \"Klute\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" that made him so perfect for the role; it's undeniable that at this point in his career he had become an elder statesman. But there's also nobody that could have delivered lines like \"That's the real question, isn't it - why? The how and the who is just scenery for the public. Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefitted? And who has the power to cover it?\" and have it really mean something. Chances are if you think about \"JFK,\" a three-hour historical thriller filled with some of the best performers of the time, you're going to think about one sequence - Sutherland's sequence. - Drew Taylor\n\nMary Tyler Moore and Judd Hirsch were nominated for their roles i Robert Redford's Best Picture winner and Timothy Hutton deservedly won Best Supporting Actor for his performance as suicidal, guilt-ridden survivor Conrad Jarrett, who blames himself for his brother's accidental death. But the glue holding the film together is Sutherland, who realizes he's utterly out of his depth with both his wife and his remaining son, who have become something like enemies. If you've only seen Sutherland play villains, this is the movie to start with to showcase what a versatile, complex and caring actor he was.\n\nIn this thriller, based on the novel by Ken Follett, Sutherland is dashing and deadly as a Nazi spy whose mission is compromised when he falls for a beautiful, lonely -- and surprisingly resourceful -- Englishwoman, played byKate Nelligan. One of his most underrated roles.\n\nAs the father of a house full of girls, Mr. Bennet mostly sits back and lets the chaos happen, leaving his wife to deal with the particulars of finding husbands for all of their daughters.\n\nWwhen Lizzie (Keira Knightley) rejects a potential suitor because she doesn't love him, he reveals not only that she's his favorite, but that he doesn't give a damn about following the expectations of his wife, or society.\n\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth,\" he tells her. \"From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.

He was one of those actors who seemed as if he would go on forever; his death at the age of 88 was not unexpected - he had been suffering from a long illness - but his presence in both cinematic classics and undistinguished B-movies alike was at the very least welcome, and at best electrifying.\n\nSomehow, he never won an Oscar, nor was even nominated for one, but Sutherland had a remarkable range that encompassed everything from broad comedy to high tragedy. He was often cast in villainous roles, which he had a great talent for, but he was equally good at conveying warmth and sensitivity, particularly as he grew into his status as a much-beloved character actor.\n\nHe will be much missed, but here are ten of the roles that he will be remembered for as long as cinema - in whatever form - exists.\n\nSutherland began his career in 1963 and was initially best known for his appearances in horror B-movies. He had his first big break in Robert Aldrich's men-on-a-mission war film The Dirty Dozen, playing the supporting role of Vernon L Pinkley, one of the stupidest and least able of the dozen, who nevertheless proves his heroic prowess when it counts in the climax, sacrificing himself while killing as many Nazis as he can in the process.\n\nAlthough the role is nominally comic relief, Sutherland brings a warped charisma to the part that sees him ably steal scenes from his more famous co-stars, even if Lee Marvin's exasperated expressions at his lunacy seem to reflect both off-screen irritation with the actor as well as his on-screen sternness.\n\nThe actor's breakthrough role came in another war picture, this time dealing with the farcical exploits of surgeons in the Korean War, again directed by Robert Altman. As the womanising, suave \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, Sutherland was given considerably more to do than in The Dirty Dozen, even if it's quite clear that Pierce would have been appalled at doing anything so grotesque as getting involved in the fighting.\n\nDuring filming, Sutherland and his co-star Elliott Gould were perpetually at loggerheads with Altman, disliking his free-wheeling, chaotic style of filmmaking, and although Gould and the director reconciled and collaborated on several more occasions, Sutherland never worked with him again. In retrospect, this is an enormous pity, as Altman proved a hugely able conductor of Sutherland's rangy, half-goofy, half-knowing charisma, and it would have been wonderful to see them make more films together.\n\nIf films such as M*A*S*H and Kelly's Heroes had established Sutherland as one of Hollywood's most beloved comic actors, then he got a real chance to stretch himself in Alan J Pakula's superb noirish thriller, in which he stars opposite Jane Fonda as a detective helping a sex worker try and discover which of her former clients is stalking her. The procedural aspects of the film are engaging enough, but what elevates this from enjoyable to unforgettable is the electrifying relationship between Fonda and Sutherland, which verges on a romance but never quite turns into one, and the chemistry between the two on screen is extraordinary. Unsurprisingly, it soon turned into an offscreen entanglement, too, their relationship lasting two years.\n\nEveryone has their favourite Donald Sutherland picture, and this is mine. Nicolas Roeg's unforgettably chilly and tragic horror film has scenes that have long since passed into cinematic iconography (the famous love scene between Sutherland and Julie Christie, which was always rumoured to have turned into real lovemaking; one of cinema's nastiest twist endings) but it's anchored by one of the actor's most humane and restrained performances. Not only does he convey the sheer tragic enormity of losing a child in an accident, but he responds to the Venetian-set, potentially supernatural shenanigans, with a mixture of doubt and stoicism that makes him a deeply sympathetic and wholly likeable lead.\n\nSutherland spent much of the Seventies in high-profile leading roles, so his return to broad comedy for John Landis's uproarious campus farce was welcomed by those who wanted to see him in a more unrestrained vein again. As the dope-smoking literature academic Professor Jennings, he is not only the epitome of a lecherous lecturer, but manages to steal scenes from the ferociously talented young comedians who co-starred alongside him.\n\nSutherland was hired because Universal, the studio behind the picture, demanded that Landis cast a name actor, and he was offered either an upfront fee of $25,000 or a 2% share of the profits. Sutherland had little faith in the film's success and so took the upfront payment, but had he taken the profit share, he would have made between $15 and $20 million, making this one of the worst business decisions ever made by an actor.\n\nAs with Don't Look Now, it's the final twist from the horror remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers that most people remember: the revelation that Sutherland's protagonist Matthew Bennell has been taken over by the pod people, as he points at Veronica Cartwright's character and emits a high-pitched scream. Yet the rest of the film is just as good, and disturbing, being a proper Seventies wallow in palm-sweating paranoia and uncertainty, where the sci-fi elements feel only like a heightened version of what was going on in the real world every day. Sutherland was cast because Mike Medavoy, head of United Artists, had liked him in Don't Look Now, but wanted him to look as similar as he did in the earlier film. To this end, he had to have his hair put in curlers every day before filming, so as to recreate a version of his earlier appearance.\n\nWith a couple of exceptions - such as his appearance in the Oscar-winning Ordinary People and his lead in the apartheid drama A Dry White Season - the Eighties were a largely useless decade for Sutherland on screen, as he was seldom cast in the roles that he merited. He rebounded spectacularly in a brief but unforgettable cameo in Oliver Stone's operatic conspiracy thriller JFK in which he played an anonymous establishment character only billed as \"X\". His character appears in a single scene, opposite Kevin Costner's Jim Garrison, and delivers a stunningly acted, almost hilariously paranoid monologue in which he raises the stakes immensely for Garrison's investigation into Kennedy's assassination by telling him what's really going on. It began a lucrative second act for Sutherland in character roles, whether villainous or plain mysterious, but this is the best of the bunch.\n\nIt may be less well known than many of the pictures on this list, but Robert Towne's inspirational sports drama, focusing on the relationship between Billy Crudup's long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine and Sutherland's coach Bill Bowerman (who went on to found Nike), deserves more recognition. By now, Sutherland had settled into the avuncular period of his career, but he brilliantly conveys Bowerman's passion for the sport, his half-antagonistic, half-supportive relationship with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the sheer commitment with which he approached his often thankless task. His performance is up there with Ian Holm in a similar role in Chariots of Fire - there is little higher praise - and he was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe, which, alas, he did not win.\n\nJoe Wright's overrated Jane Austen adaptation has one ace up its frilly sleeve, and that is Sutherland's wonderfully rich and humane performance as Mr Bennett. Most of the film cannot compare to the legendary BBC adaptation, but for my money Sutherland is richer, more poignant and funnier than even Benjamin Whitrow's superb appearance in the television drama, bringing every conceivable ounce of nuance and wit to the part.\n\nThe American version of the film insisted on adding a redundant romantic scene between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen at its conclusion, but the picture proper ends with a wonderfully warm and witty scene in which Sutherland, wryly reflecting on the matrimonial antics of his family, declares \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, for heaven's sake, send them in. I'm quite at my leisure.\"\n\nSutherland was very good at playing villains, even in films that didn't deserve him, but it was in the four-film adaptation of Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games books that he truly excelled. As the superbly named President Coriolanus Snow, the despotic ruler of Panem, Sutherland, in his last major roles in cinema, conveys a mixture of brutality, intelligence and realpolitik, giving the sometimes tedious romantic entanglements that Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss is embroiled in a weight and gravity that the films do not really merit. Every time that his white-bearded tyrant appears on screen, the pictures become more compelling, and Sutherland brings a wry, seen-it-all quality to his acts of villainy that makes them all the more chilling in their monstrousness.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie", "type":

He was one of those actors who seemed as if he would go on forever; his death at the age of 88 was not unexpected - he had been suffering from a long illness - but his presence in both cinematic classics and undistinguished B-movies alike was at the very least welcome, and at best electrifying.\n\nSomehow, he never won an Oscar, nor was even nominated for one, but Sutherland had a remarkable range that encompassed everything from broad comedy to high tragedy. He was often cast in villainous roles, which he had a great talent for, but he was equally good at conveying warmth and sensitivity, particularly as he grew into his status as a much-beloved character actor.\n\nHe will be much missed, but here are ten of the roles that he will be remembered for as long as cinema - in whatever form - exists.\n\nThe Dirty Dozen (1967)\n\nSutherland began his career in 1963 and was initially best known for his appearances in horror B-movies. He had his first big break in Robert Aldrich's men-on-a-mission war film The Dirty Dozen, playing the supporting role of Vernon L Pinkley, one of the stupidest and least able of the dozen, who nevertheless proves his heroic prowess when it counts in the climax, sacrificing himself while killing as many Nazis as he can in the process.\n\nAlthough the role is nominally comic relief, Sutherland brings a warped charisma to the part that sees him ably steal scenes from his more famous co-stars, even if Lee Marvin's exasperated expressions at his lunacy seem to reflect both off-screen irritation with the actor as well as his on-screen sternness.\n\nM*A*S*H (1970)\n\nThe actor's breakthrough role came in another war picture, this time dealing with the farcical exploits of surgeons in the Korean War, again directed by Robert Altman. As the womanising, suave \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, Sutherland was given considerably more to do than in The Dirty Dozen, even if it's quite clear that Pierce would have been appalled at doing anything so grotesque as getting involved in the fighting.\n\nDuring filming, Sutherland and his co-star Elliott Gould were perpetually at loggerheads with Altman, disliking his free-wheeling, chaotic style of filmmaking, and although Gould and the director reconciled and collaborated on several more occasions, Sutherland never worked with him again. In retrospect, this is an enormous pity, as Altman proved a hugely able conductor of Sutherland's rangy, half-goofy, half-knowing charisma, and it would have been wonderful to see them make more films together.\n\nKlute (1971)\n\nIf films such as M*A*S*H and Kelly's Heroes had established Sutherland as one of Hollywood's most beloved comic actors, then he got a real chance to stretch himself in Alan J Pakula's superb noirish thriller, in which he stars opposite Jane Fonda as a detective helping a sex worker try and discover which of her former clients is stalking her. The procedural aspects of the film are engaging enough, but what elevates this from enjoyable to unforgettable is the electrifying relationship between Fonda and Sutherland, which verges on a romance but never quite turns into one, and the chemistry between the two on screen is extraordinary. Unsurprisingly, it soon turned into an offscreen entanglement, too, their relationship lasting two years.\n\nDon't Look Now (1973)\n\nEveryone has their favourite Donald Sutherland picture, and this is mine. Nicolas Roeg's unforgettably chilly and tragic horror film has scenes that have long since passed into cinematic iconography (the famous love scene between Sutherland and Julie Christie, which was always rumoured to have turned into real lovemaking; one of cinema's nastiest twist endings) but it's anchored by one of the actor's most humane and restrained performances. Not only does he convey the sheer tragic enormity of losing a child in an accident, but he responds to the Venetian-set, potentially supernatural shenanigans, with a mixture of doubt and stoicism that makes him a deeply sympathetic and wholly likeable lead.\n\nNational Lampoon's Animal House (1978)\n\nSutherland spent much of the Seventies in high-profile leading roles, so his return to broad comedy for John Landis's uproarious campus farce was welcomed by those who wanted to see him in a more unrestrained vein again. As the dope-smoking literature academic Professor Jennings, he is not only the epitome of a lecherous lecturer, but manages to steal scenes from the ferociously talented young comedians who co-starred alongside him.\n\nSutherland was hired because Universal, the studio behind the picture, demanded that Landis cast a name actor, and he was offered either an upfront fee of $25,000 or a 2% share of the profits. Sutherland had little faith in the film's success and so took the upfront payment, but had he taken the profit share, he would have made between $15 and $20 million, making this one of the worst business decisions ever made by an actor.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)\n\nAs with Don't Look Now, it's the final twist from the horror remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers that most people remember: the revelation that Sutherland's protagonist Matthew Bennell has been taken over by the pod people, as he points at Veronica Cartwright's character and emits a high-pitched scream. Yet the rest of the film is just as good, and disturbing, being a proper Seventies wallow in palm-sweating paranoia and uncertainty, where the sci-fi elements feel only like a heightened version of what was going on in the real world every day. Sutherland was cast because Mike Medavoy, head of United Artists, had liked him in Don't Look Now, but wanted him to look as similar as he did in the earlier film. To this end, he had to have his hair put in curlers every day before filming, so as to recreate a version of his earlier appearance.\n\nJFK (1991)\n\nWith a couple of exceptions - such as his appearance in the Oscar-winning Ordinary People and his lead in the apartheid drama A Dry White Season - the Eighties were a largely useless decade for Sutherland on screen, as he was seldom cast in the roles that he merited. He rebounded spectacularly in a brief but unforgettable cameo in Oliver Stone's operatic conspiracy thriller JFK in which he played an anonymous establishment character only billed as \"X\". His character appears in a single scene, opposite Kevin Costner's Jim Garrison, and delivers a stunningly acted, almost hilariously paranoid monologue in which he raises the stakes immensely for Garrison's investigation into Kennedy's assassination by telling him what's really going on. It began a lucrative second act for Sutherland in character roles, whether villainous or plain mysterious, but this is the best of the bunch.\n\nWithout Limits (1998)\n\nIt may be less well known than many of the pictures on this list, but Robert Towne's inspirational sports drama, focusing on the relationship between Billy Crudup's long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine and Sutherland's coach Bill Bowerman (who went on to found Nike), deserves more recognition. By now, Sutherland had settled into the avuncular period of his career, but he brilliantly conveys Bowerman's passion for the sport, his half-antagonistic, half-supportive relationship with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the sheer commitment with which he approached his often thankless task. His performance is up there with Ian Holm in a similar role in Chariots of Fire - there is little higher praise - and he was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe, which, alas, he did not win.\n\nPride and Prejudice (2005)\n\nJoe Wright's overrated Jane Austen adaptation has one ace up its frilly sleeve, and that is Sutherland's wonderfully rich and humane performance as Mr Bennett. Most of the film cannot compare to the legendary BBC adaptation, but for my money Sutherland is richer, more poignant and funnier than even Benjamin Whitrow's superb appearance in the television drama, bringing every conceivable ounce of nuance and wit to the part.\n\nThe American version of the film insisted on adding a redundant romantic scene between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen at its conclusion, but the picture proper ends with a wonderfully warm and witty scene in which Sutherland, wryly reflecting on the matrimonial antics of his family, declares \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, for heaven's sake, send them in. I'm quite at my leisure.\"\n\nThe Hunger Games (2012 - 2016)\n\nSutherland was very good at playing villains, even in films that didn't deserve him, but it was in the four-film adaptation of Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games books that he truly excelled. As the superbly named President Coriolanus Snow, the despotic ruler of Panem, Sutherland, in his last major roles in cinema, conveys a mixture of brutality, intelligence and realpolitik, giving the sometimes tedious romantic entanglements that Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss is embroiled in a weight and gravity that the films do not really merit. Every time that his white-bearded tyrant appears on screen, the pictures become more compelling, and Sutherland brings a wry, seen-it-all quality to his acts of villainy that makes them all the more chilling in their monstrousness.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_larman@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Alexander Larman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B movie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Gould", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Gould"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakthrough role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aldrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Aldrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Farce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Marvin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Marvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Promiscuity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Landis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Landis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Roeg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

From classic war movies to popular blockbusters, Sutherland's career spanned the evolution of cinema and his impact was profound. Despite never winning an Oscar, Sutherland's contributions to film, politics, and activism will be remembered for generations to come. His memoir is set to be published in November.\n\nLegendary American actor Donald Sutherland has died at the age of 88, casting a sad mood across Hollywood and in the hearts of cinephiles everywhere. The actor had recently completed his first book, a memoir that will undoubtedly become treasured by his fans and film lovers in general. The book, titled Made Up, But Still True, is set to be published Nov. 12, 2024. The actor passed away in Miami. Sutherland had fought illness for most of his life. As he told The L.A. Times in 1989:\n\nPolio, rheumatic fever, hepatitis, an appendectomy, pneumonia, scarlet fever.\n\n\"And spinal meningitis,\" the actor said. \"I died. . . . \"\n\nA reporter chuckled. Sutherland looked perturbed.\n\n\"Yes. I died. For four or five seconds,\" he said.\n\nDonald Sutherland's career ran concurrent with the changes across Hollywood and film itself. He began his film career in some of the greatest war movies of all time -- The Dirty Dozen (1967), M*A*S*H (1970), Kelly's Heroes (1970), and Johnny Got His Gun (1971). This coincided with his growing passion in politics and involvement in anti-war protests, exacerbated after meeting Jane Fonda in her Oscar-winning movie Klute (1971). The two would begin a romantic relationship and life-long friendship, and made the protest film F.T.A. (\"f*ck the army\") in 1972, based on their traveling performances.\n\nClose\n\nSutherland went on to have an extremely diverse career, starring in some of the greatest movies of all time (Don't Look Now, Ordinary People, JFK, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and some of the most popular (The Hunger Games franchise, Horrible Bosses, National Lampoon's Animal House).

Deadline reports that Sutherland passed away in Miami after a long illness.\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick on July 17, 1935, Sutherland was a correspondent for a local radio station in his teens. Wanting to pursue a career in acting, he left Canada in 1957 to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He began to land small parts in British TV shows like The Avengers and The Saint, and in British horror movies from Hammer and Amicus, including Die! Die! My Darling! and Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.

Given that his career spanned six decades, it would have been an exceptionally long list of disparate characters.\n\nHe appeared in some 200 films and TV shows, playing everything from the charismatic Chief Surgeon 'Hawkeye' Pierce in the movie version of the Korean war comedy, M*A*S*H* to President Coriolanus Snow in the Hunger Games and a composite character called Mr. X in Oliver Stone's JFK. His other films included Don't Look Now, Ordinary People, Pride & Prejudice, Fellini's Casanova, 1900, National Lampoon's Animal House, Klute and The Dirty Dozen.\n\nHe worked for such directors as Bernardo Bertolucci, Robert Aldrich, Robert Altman, Alan J. Pakula, Nicolas Roeg, Ron Howard and Robert Redford. \"For me, working with these great guys was like falling in love\", he once said. \"I was their lover, their beloved\".\n\nThough he never won an Oscar he did win two Golden Globes, for Citizen X, an HBO film, and for Path to War. He also won an Emmy for the former.\n\nNews of Sutherland's death was announced on X/Twitter by Kiefer Sutherland, one of his four sons. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film\", said Kiefer. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived\".\n\nRon Howard, who directed Sutherland snr in Backdraft, described him as 'One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence\".\n\nDonald Sutherland, who was born in New Brunswick, Canada, in 1935, studied at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1956 as a major in English. He learned much of his acting craft in London and served some of his apprenticeship at Perth Repertory Theatre. He forever took pride in the fact that his ancestral roots were in Scotland; one of his ancestors was reportedly a soldier named Peter Sutherland, who sailed to America from Scotland in the 1770s to fight in the Revolutionary War.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with the Daily Record he recalled being so lost in the moment while on stage at Perth that he was oblivious to everything else. \"One time when I came on stage, I hit my foot and tore off my big toe nail. But I didn't feel a thing till I walked off stage and I screamed. Then I went back on stage and again I felt nothing because the adrenalin was pumping.\"\n\nHe eventually made his acting debut in a 1964 Italian Gothic horror film, Castle of the Living Dead. During the shooting he met Shirley Douglas, the woman who would become his second wife. Three years later he was one of The Dirty Dozen, a Second World War-based film.\n\nIn Klute (1971), Pakula's taut suspense thriller, he played opposite Jane Fonda, who earned a Best Actress Oscar for her role.\n\nIn 1973 he co-starred with Julie Christie in Roeg's paranormal thriller, Don't Look Now - they played grieving parents who take a holiday in Venice to trying to cope with the loss of their daughter, only to be haunted by her presence at every turn.\n\nA new generation of film fans discovered Sutherland for themselves when in 2012 he played President Snow in the first film in the hugely popular Hunger Games series. \"I hadn't even heard of the books,\" he admitted, \"but it became patently apparent to me that this was something. It was the first thing I'd read in years that could become a creative political stimulus for young people\".\n\nIn 2016 he played opposite his son Kiefer for the first time in a western, Forsaken.\n\nHe was always self-deprecating on the subject of his looks. He once asked his mother if he was good-looking. No, came the answer. \"But your face has a lot of character\".\n\nIn 2011, interviewed by the Daily Record, he recalled the time when he had last worked in Scotland, in a war-time film called Eye Of The Needle. \"We were getting a helicopter at Glasgow airport to drop us off on Mull\", he said.\n\n\"As I was walking across the runway with my dresser, I noticed this Scottish air hostess. She was pretty, wearing a hat, little jacket, black knee-high boots and short skirt. \"This girl stopped in front of me and said, 'You're Donald Sutherland, aren't you? You are not nearly as ugly as you are on telly'.\n\n\"My dresser laughed so hard, he fell on the ground. I could have kicked him.

He starred in one of his final projects, Lawmen: Bass Reeves, alongside David Oyelowo on Paramount+ last fall.\n\nThe Canadian-born Sutherland has one of the most impressive resumes you can imagine, racking up memorable roles in classics like Klute, Don't Look Now, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Ordinary People, and a memorable and hilarious supporting role in Animal House. In later years, he would make one of the most iconic single-scene appearances in film history as Mr. X in Oliver Stone's JFK and appear in all four original Hunger Games movies as the series's primary villain, President Coriolanus Snow.\n\nDespite his lengthy career and plethora of great roles in great movies, Sutherland was never nominated for an Academy Award, and was frequently cited as one of the best to never receive that honor. He did, however, receive an honorary Oscar in 2017, and won an Emmy for his work in the 1995 TV film Citizen X.\n\nHe was also known as the father of Kiefer Sutherland, who played Jack Bauer on 24 and is a well-accomplished actor in his own right. Kiefer was among the first to pay tribute to his late father on social media.\n\n\"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" he wrote. \"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nAfter news of Sutherland's death was confirmed, many online reacted by paying tribute to the actor and his wonderful work.\n\nWhile he was best known for his work in film, Sutherland did some great work on television as well. He played a wealthy family patriarch in the underrated Dirty Sexy Money (which was, in a way, a precursor to Succession), portrayed J. Paul Getty in Danny Boyle's Trust, and earned praise for the gravitas he put on display in HBO's The Undoing.", "source": {"uri": "menshealth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bass Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Oyelowo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Oyelowo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Donald Sutherland, legendary star of M.A.S.H., Ordinary People", "body": "Earlier this year, it was announced that Sutherland would publish a memoir, Made Up, But Still True, \"cataloging with powerful detail his far too many brushes with death, his loving relationship with his parents, and behind-the-scenes stories of the movies he's starred in.\" Per the Associated Press, Sutherland was born in Canada and overcame a series of childhood diseases -- including infantile paralysis, rheumatoid fever and spinal meningitis -- before becoming an actor. He starred in B-movies and guested on television series through the early 1960s before making a mark in The Dirty Dozen, a film which led to his breakout role in M.A.S.H.\n\nSutherland became a notable on-screen figure in the 1970s New Hollywood era, starring in films such as The Great Train Robbery, Don't Look Now, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Federico Fellini's Casanova and more. Though he himself was never nominated for an Academy Award for acting, he starred in many Oscar-nominated films such as Klute, Ordinary People, and JFK. In 1995, he won an Emmy and Golden Globe for his work in Citizen X. (He would later take home another Golden Globe for Path To War in 2002.) He was granted an Honorary Oscar in 2017.\n\nYounger audiences got to know Sutherland as the villain President Snow in the blockbuster Hunger Games franchise, showcasing his signature sinister, intimidating demeanor. But he was also able to project remarkable warmth, as in his performance as the reticent patriarch Mr. Bennet in the beloved 2005 adaptation of Pride And Prejudice. He remained incredibly active as a working actor in his later years, starring in multiple films as well as TV series such as Trust (in which he starred as J. Paul Getty), The Undoing opposite Nicole Kidman, and Taylor Sheridan's Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette and five children, including actor Kiefer Sutherland. The pair appeared on screen together for the first time in 2016 in the western Forsaken, which Kiefer called \"the project of a lifetime\" after having \"wanted to work with my father for 30 years.\"\n\nThe film was \"not about\" the \"father-son\" thing, Kiefer told The A.V. Club. \"This was a film about two actors wanting to try and tell a story... and taking advantage of the fact that we looked like a father and son. [Laughs.] It was amazing. I think one of the things I was most interested in finding out was how differently we approached our work. And my reality was that we didn't approach it very differently at all, which was funny,\" he shared. \"When I was about 15 years old, I saw a headshot that he had done, and his hands were in exactly the same place as mine were in the headshot that I was using at the time. And I didn't grow up with my dad, so it was always very funny to me, and always has been, what an important part DNA plays in one's life. And that was a great example of that. So, yeah, we approached the work, at least, very similarly. I think that we are very different actors, but it was cool for me to see that.\"", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

A rakish, loose-limbed 6 ft 4 in, with big ears, a toothy grin, prominent pale blue eyes and a hang dog expression, he might have been called ugly in conventional terms.\n\nAt the same time, though, he exerted a brooding sexual magnetism which many women found irresistible, and his lugubrious baritone voice was as instantly recognisable as James Mason's.\n\nHe was respected by his peers and by directors for his willingness to accept direction, and for his ability to bring his artistic intelligence to bear on absorbing a director's wishes. He believed that the actor's job is not to argue, but to be manipulated, an unusual view in Hollywood, where stars traditionally behave like autocrats.\n\nYet at the same time Sutherland was no cipher. Laid-back and likeably eccentric, he always insisted on a no-nudity clause in his contracts, on the grounds that he did not want the sight of his penis to destroy an audience's suspension of disbelief.\n\nSutherland's easy charm was best expressed in the character of Hawkeye Pierce, the oddball iconoclast in Robert Altman's Korean war satire M*A*S*H (1970), the film which catapulted him to stardom. Interestingly, Sutherland did not consider he had made the best of Altman's light-touch directing style, as he had not yet learnt his place as an actor, and insisted on playing the part his own way.\n\nHis perception of the actor's role was changed by the British director Nicolas Roeg, for whom he worked in his adaption of Daphne du Maurier's eerie horror tale Don't Look Now (1974). Sutherland had read the story and agreed to do it, but suggested to Roeg that it should have a happy ending. \"Do you want to do it or not?\" Roeg demanded brusquely. \"Because that's the film.\"\n\nSutherland went on to give one of his most memorable performances as the bereaved father haunted by visions of his recently drowned daughter. The film was particularly memorable for a torrid sex scene between Sutherland and his co-star Julie Christie, which was so realistic it left audiences wondering whether the two had become carried away and had actually done the deed.\n\nIn fact, the scene was a very good example of Sutherland's ability to take direction. As he recalled later, the two barely knew each other when they had to walk naked on to the set and lie on the bed: \"The director said: 'Right, Julie, pull your knees up to your shoulder. Donald, take your mouth and slide it down the inside of her left thigh.' It went on like this for 12 hours. Neither of us could speak afterwards.\"\n\nSutherland worked for some of the greatest directors of the 20th century, including Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, Louis Malle, John Schlesinger and Robert Aldrich.\n\nAmong other performances, he played the psychopathic private who impersonates a general in The Dirty Dozen; the star-struck clerk, Homer Simpson, in Schlesinger's The Day of the Locust; a fascist foreman in Bertolucci's 1900; the title role in Fellini's Casanova; the father struggling to keep his family together in Robert Redford's Ordinary People (1980); and an Afrikaner teacher who sees the light in A Dry White Season (1998).\n\nYet Sutherland's very versatility sometimes counted against him, and his name was conspicuously absent from the lists of Oscar nominations. His failure to build up a consistent image meant that he never had an identifiable following. Because no two of his roles were alike, audiences never knew what to expect when he was cast and formed no clear view of his personality.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born on July 17 1935 at St John, New Brunswick, and was raised in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, where his father ran the local bus, gas and elctricity company. As a child he suffered frequent bouts of ill health: he contracted polio when he was two and was confined to bed with rheumatic fever for a year at the age of 11.\n\nSutherland never visited the theatre as a child and at first he wanted to be a sculptor. But he was soon showing his potential as a performer, becoming Canada's youngest disc jockey aged 14 and winning local acclaim for his vivid radio portrayal of Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.\n\nHe still harboured ambitions to become a sculptor, though his father advised him to get a profession to fall back on and he entered Toronto University to study Engineering. His first taste of theatre came via a variety of roles in campus productions: his performance in The Tempest brought the attention of a Toronto Globe and Mail critic, who suggested to Sutherland that he consider an acting career.\n\nBy the end of his time at the university, he was so involved in acting, he failed his exams in accounting and statistics. He transferred to Victoria College and graduated in English.\n\nSutherland admired the versatility of British actors such as Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness and decided to train in Britain, rather than in America, believing that British acting schools instilled better discipline. He arrived in London in 1952 to study at Lamda, but found it \"snobby and unwelcoming\" and left a year later, after his voice coach advised him to become a lorry driver.\n\nHe then auditioned for the Perth Repertory Theatre and was taken on as their second lead, beginning an apprenticeship in British rep which took him all round the country. By 1961 he was appearing in television shows like The Saint and in 1963 he made his West End stage debut in August for the People with Rex Harrison and Rachel Roberts.\n\nThe following year he was cast in his first significant film role, Il Castello dei Morti Vivi (Castle of the Living Dead), an Italian horror movie directed by Warren Keifer, in which Sutherland had an early chance to demonstrate his versatility by playing a dual role as a young soldier and an old hag.\n\nHis performance in this otherwise unedifying piece was enough to convince various casting directors of his potential - at least for horror movies - and, after moving to America, Sutherland was soon appearing in a number of second-rate examples of the genre, including Dr Terror's House of Horrors and Die! Die! Darling! (both 1965).\n\nA move into more respectable fare came in 1967, when Robert Aldrich cast him as a slow-witted killer in the highly successful The Dirty Dozen. By the early 1970s, Sutherland had become an established star, thanks to his leading roles in Kelly's Heroes (1970), Start the Revolution Without Me (1969) and M*A*S*H (1970).\n\nIn 1971 he enhanced his reputation for versatility with a portrayal of a small town private detective in Alan J Pakula's Klute, from which his co-star Jane Fonda walked away with an Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nBy this time, Sutherland had become something of an idol for younger audiences, due to the kind of roles he took on and to his vociferous opposition to the Vietnam war. He had begun an affair with Jane Fonda during the filming of Klute and together they roamed the world, denouncing the war. In 1972 they made the anti-war documentary FTA. Sutherland continued his mainstream Hollywood work, enjoying success with Don't Look Now in 1973 as well as The Day of the Locust (1974) and Fellini's Casanova (1976).\n\nIn 1978, he won a permanent place in the hearts of ageing hippies with his portrayal of a pot-smoking, metaphysics-spouting college professor in National Lampoon's Animal House. Sutherland had been so convinced the film would be a failure that, when offered a percent of the gross profits or an upfront payment of $40,000, he took the upfront payment. Had he taken the gross percentage he would have earned $30-40 million. It was the sort of bad judgment that would be repeated on several occasions during his career.\n\nAfter the critically acclaimed Ordinary People (1980), in which almost the entire ensemble got Oscar nominations except for Sutherland, he entered a relatively unremarkable phase of his career, appearing in one forgettable film after another. He turned down starring roles in Deliverance and Straw Dogs because he did not agree with the violence, though he later admitted he had been wrong to do so.\n\nIn 1989, however, he won ecstatic reviews for his role in A Dry White Season and his title role in Bethune: The Making of a Hero.\n\nIn the 1990s, he was the informant who cried conspiracy in JFK (1991), a Van Helsing figure in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), a wealthy New Yorker who gets taken in by con artist Will Smith in Six Degrees of Separation (1993), and a general in the virus thriller Outbreak (1995).\n\nThe same year, he won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role in the television drama Citizen X. In 1998, he earned a Golden Globe nomination for his performance as the track coach in Without Limits, Robert Towne's film based on the life of the runner Steve Prefontaine. He won another Golden Globe in 2003 for the Vietnam-themed TV movie Path to War.\n\nIn 2000, he enjoyed further critical and commercial success with Space Cowboys, a good-natured adventure in which he teamed up with Tommy Lee Jones, Clint Eastwood and James Garner as geriatric astronauts who get another chance to blast into orbit.\n\nSutherland continued working into old age, his President Snow adding a silky, sinister presence to four instalments of the Hunger Games film series (2012-15); and last year he lent gravitas to the acclaimed Paramount+ Western miniseries Lawmen: Bass Reeves as \"Hanging\" Judge Parker.\n\nSutherland made his Broadway debut in 1981 in Lolita and appeared in 2000 at the Savoy Theatre, London, as a reclusive Nobel Prize-winning author in Enigmatic Variations, a translation by his son Roeg of a play by the French writer Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt. Neither play was a critical success, however.\n\nIn the 1970s he had turned down an offer to act in and invest in La Cage aux Folles which went on to be a spectacular Broadway hit. The decision was one which, he freely confessed, made him feel \"very stupid for a long time\".\n\nHe was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 2017.\n\nSutherland enjoyed expensive wines, but only drank claret after finding that Burgundy turned him \"into Oliver Reed\". He became a crusading non-smoker after discovering that he was allergic to smoke. He was devoted to his (third) family and to his Jack Russell, Ruby.\n\nSutherland was married three times, first, in 1959 (dissolved 1966) to Lois Hardwick, a Canadian actress whom he met during his time in Britain; secondly, in 1966 (dissolved 1971) to Shirley Douglas, another Canadian actress and daughter of Tommy Douglas, the leader of Canada's centre-left New Democratic Party; and thirdly, in 1990, to Francine Racette, a French-Canadian actress whom he had lived with since 1972.\n\nHe had a daughter and a son by Shirley Douglas and three sons by Francine Racette. All his sons (Angus Redford, Rossif, Roeg and Kiefer Sutherland, the actor) were named after film directors.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

But even when Canadian icon Donald Sutherland, who died Thursday in Miami at the age 88, appeared in some questionable productions - the 2020 zombie flick Alone, the 2012 espionage-on-a-budget thriller Assassin's Bullet, and too many more to list here - the silver-tongued actor brought a magnificent dignity and committed professionalism to his surroundings.\n\nObituary: Donald Sutherland was cinema's Canadian chameleon\n\nSeeing Donald Sutherland's name pop up in the opening credits was a kind of implicit promise from the producers to the audience: You are in good, sturdy hands. And when the actual writing and director and co-stars and resources of a film actually matched Sutherland's high-tier talents? When those surrounding the star brought their very best game to go toe-to-toe with one of the most screen-ready performers of his generation? Then the results were remarkable, culture-shaking events.\n\nAcross more than 125 productions, Sutherland's career came to define modern cinema. Robert Altman's M*A*S*H, Alan J. Pakula's Klute, John Landis's Animal House, Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Philip Kaufman's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Robert Redford's Ordinary People. It is a filmography so medium-altering to make you dizzy with envy and respect. And those are just highlights from two of his seven decades on screen. When all the elements lined up in Sutherland's filmography, the movies - and the audiences - were changed forever.\n\n\"I personally think he was one of the most important actors in the history of film,\" Sutherland's son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, wrote in a statement Thursday noting his father's death. This is not merely a common case of the bereaved family reaching for hyperbole, either: For so many years, Donald Sutherland was the wondrously slick oil that kept the entertainment machine moving.\n\nBorn in Saint John, N.B., in 1935, Sutherland's first foray into the world of media was when he snagged a part-time job as a correspondent for a local radio station at the precocious age of just 14. Soon enough, he would move onto balancing career ambitions in both engineering and drama, eventually favouring the latter by heading to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 1957.\n\nA high-energy series of parts in Hammer horror films and British television, including a pair of appearances on the popular spy series The Avengers and The Saint, led to Sutherland being recruited for Robert Aldrich's incendiary thriller The Dirty Dozen, which in 1967 would significantly shake the Hollywood system to its core. The film's success punted Sutherland to Hollywood, where in the two decades that followed the actor would use the twin powers of his hammer-wrapped-in-silk voice and spirited-yet-haunting eyes to power a wild string of cinematic milestones.\n\nAs a performer, he seemed to strike gold with an almost supernatural regularity. If you were so cruel as to scratch three-quarters of his screen work from the record, you would still be left with enough out-and-out masterpieces to power an entire wing of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences museum.\n\nTake Sutherland's gleefully mischievous professor in Animal House, both boldly representative of and sneakily subverting the academics who molded a generation. His pioneering work as a father and husband ripped apart by grief in Don't Look Now lives rent-free in the heads of so many contemporary filmmakers, actors and moviegoers who have turned the loose theme of \"trauma\" into its own burgeoning genre. No one can or should forget his commitment to give his body and soul over to the European masters of cinema, in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 and Federico Fellini's Casanova.\n\nAnd this is all before Sutherland embraced what would become his sincerely sinister era, playing villains so engaging that you couldn't help but end up siding with them just a little. Consider his friendly spook in Oliver Stone's JFK - no other performer could have delivered such a ridiculously paranoid monologue of conspiratorial Coles Notes and make them sound even slightly plausible. He could shoot a stare as cold as ice, directly piercing audiences' hearts, such as in Wolfgang Petersen's Outbreak, an excellent experiment in fear-mongering. And he managed to reach into the nightmares of an entirely new generation with his performance as the cruel fascist manipulating the gladiatorial contests of The Hunger Games.\n\nYet as much as Sutherland committed himself to playing within the Hollywood studio system, he also constantly felt the pull toward his home country.\n\nFor starters, the actor famously held on to his Canadian citizenship against all expectations of his made-in-the-U.S.A. success story.\n\n\"They ask me at the border why I don't take American citizenship. I could still be Canadian, they say. You could have dual citizenship. But I say: No, I'm not dual anything. I'm Canadian,\" Sutherland once wrote in The Globe and Mail. \"There's a maple leaf in my underwear somewhere. There used to be a beaver there, too, but I'm 80 now and beavers are known to take off when you're in your 80s.\"\n\nIt was a mentality and spirit that Sutherland doubled down on when it came to his career. Across dozens of films and television series, he made it known that he was here to support the Canadian industry just as much as the one to our south. His performances in Murder By Decree, Threshold, Forsaken (alongside Kiefer) and even in the moving 1987 National Film Board documentary Give Me Your Answer True revealed an artist and storyteller who could never, and would never, forget the country he came from. For goodness sake, he even played Canadian hero Norman Bethune not once, but twice.\n\nWhile the actor certainly cherished the acclaim and attention his Hollywood work delivered, he also seemed to use his many deserved opportunities to act as a cultural ambassador of sorts for Canada. With his piercing, prairie-sky blue eyes, his subtle and dignified command of a room and his gentle purr, Sutherland maintained the picture of a dignified, curious, cut-your-heart-and-it-bleeds-maple-syrup Canadian hero. Not for nothing was Sutherland immortalized on a Canadian stamp.

Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nIndeed. The Canadian native played almost too many iconic, wide ranging roles to count, from wisecracking Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H and a hippie professor in \"Animal House\" to an introverted detective in \"Klute\" and repressed, grieving father in \"Ordinary People.\"\n\nIn a career that spanned six decades plus and more than 100 movies, Sutherland eventually touched the younger generation as well, moving on to popcorn fare like \"The Hunger Games\" franchise and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nThe honorary Oscar winner's longtime agency CAA confirmed the news of his passing to Deadline, adding that he died in Miami.\n\nA little known fact is that the thrice married father of five had been a Miami Beach resident for the past few years.\n\nSutherland and his third wife, Francine Racette, bought a two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom waterfront condo at the Portofino Tower in South Beach in 2012 for $1.6 million. The couple met on the set of \"Alien Thunder\" in 1972 and went on to have three sons, Rossif, Angus and Roeg.\n\nIn 2018, while promoting his dramedy with Helen Mirren, \"The Leisure Seeker,\" Sutherland specifically asked a reporter to meet at Smith & Wollensky, one of his favorite steakhouses in the SoFi neighborhood. During the course of the interview he stared out at the water, and mentioned how much he and his wife loved living in the area and checking out new restaurants.\n\nThe tall and lean leading man was

He became a countercultural icon with roles in classic films such as \"The Dirty Dozen,\" \"MASH,\" \"Klute,\" and \"Don't Look Now,\" among many others. Throughout his career, he portrayed villains, antiheroes, romantic leads, and mentor figures with equal aplomb, winning accolades and adoration from audiences worldwide.\n\nSutherland's recent acclaim included his role as President Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise, which brought him renewed prominence in popular culture. He continued to captivate audiences with his performances, appearing as Judge Parker in the series \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves\" and in the 2022 series \"Swimming With Sharks.\"\n\nHis achievements were not limited to the big screen. Sutherland won a supporting actor Emmy for his compelling portrayal in HBO's \"Citizen X\" in 1995 and received critical acclaim for his role in the Lifetime miniseries \"Human Trafficking\" in 2006.\n\nBeginning his career with roles in low-budget horror films like \"Castle of the Living Dead\" (1963) and \"Die! Die! My Darling!\" (1965), Sutherland quickly ascended to more significant roles, including his memorable part in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) and his collaboration with Elliot Gould in \"Little Murders\" (1971) and Irvin Kershner in \"SPYS\" (1974).\n\nHis role as Sgt. Oddball in the WWII action film \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970), alongside Clint Eastwood, solidified his reputation as a scene-stealer with his portrayal of an eccentric tank commander. Sutherland later reunited with Eastwood in \"Space Cowboys\" (2000), showcasing his versatility as a former hotshot pilot.\n\nIn 1971, Sutherland starred in \"Klute,\" directed by Alan J. Pakula, opposite Jane Fonda, marking a significant milestone in his career. His portrayal of a troubled detective who becomes romantically entangled with a call girl (Fonda) earned critical acclaim, with Fonda crediting Sutherland for her Oscar-winning performance.\n\nBeyond his acting prowess, Sutherland was known for his activism during the Vietnam War era. Alongside Fonda, Peter Boyle, and Howard Hesseman, he co-founded the controversial antiwar troupe FTA (Free the Army), which performed for troops and drew the ire of government agencies like the Pentagon and the FBI.\n\nSutherland's career continued to evolve with roles in influential films such as Nicholas Roeg's psychological thriller \"Don't Look Now\" (1973), where his restrained acting style complemented Julie Christie's performance in a haunting tale of grief and loss.\n\nDespite occasional setbacks, including turning down roles in films like \"Deliverance\" (1972) and opting for unconventional choices like \"Alex in Wonderland\" (1970) over \"Straw Dogs\" (1971), Sutherland's commitment to challenging roles remained unwavering. His portrayal of complex characters in films like \"Fellini's Casanova\" (1976) and Bertolucci's \"1900\" (1977) underscored his willingness to take risks and explore diverse facets of human nature.\n\nIn 1980, Sutherland delivered a career-defining performance in \"Ordinary People,\" directed by Robert Redford, where he portrayed a grieving father navigating family turmoil.

He's been a staple of the film industry for well over half a century at this point, having risen to fame during the late 1960s and early 1970s and continuing to work steadily in the decades since, with acting credits into the early 2020s.\n\nHe has over 150 feature film roles to his name, which makes the process of selecting Sutherland's very best films something of a daunting task. Plenty of movies he's featured in can be considered classics, and it's hard to capture every single good movie he was in unless you want to be here all day. As such, what follows is a ranking of some of the best films Donald Sutherland has been in during his acting career, ranked below from good to great.\n\n12 'Kelly's Heroes' (1970)\n\nFunnily enough, Donald Sutherland starred in two comedic war films in the year 1970. One was M*A*S*H, which was a huge success upon release, detailing the lives of various medical staff serving in the Korean War. The film was spun off into an even more successful (and arguably much better) TV show in 1972, which ran for 11 seasons and concluded in 1983.\n\nThe other movie was Kelly's Heroes, and though it can't claim to have as grand a legacy as M*A*S*H, it's probably the one that's easier to watch nowadays. Sutherland's solid in a supporting role, while Clint Eastwood plays the lead, and the story revolves around soldiers going AWOL to rob a German bank during World War II. It's silly and old-fashioned, but there's a good deal of fun to be had in watching it blend the comedy, war, and crime genres.\n\n11 'M*A*S*H' (1970)\n\nFor better or worse, M*A*S*H's legacy does mean that it's worth acknowledging as one of Donald Sutherland's most notable films, especially because it was a significant one early in his career. And the whole inspiring a legendary TV series, which itself had one of the best and most popular finales of all time? That has to be worth something, too.\n\nSutherland is the main character in the movie version of M*A*S*H, playing Hawkeye Pierce, who ended up being played by Alan Alda in the TV show. As for the movie, it was fair (and probably funnier) for its day, and even if modern-day viewers might not find themselves quite so amused, they can surely at least acknowledge it for the way it shaped pop culture at large.\n\n10 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' (2013)\n\nThe most recognizable Donald Sutherland role to many young people today might well be that of President Coriolanus Snow. He's the main antagonist throughout all four movies in the Hunger Games series, with Snow serving as the ruler of the dystopian world the films take place in and being instrumental to the running of the titular (and deadly) Hunger Games.\n\nSutherland's probably at his best during the best movie in the series, which would be the second of the four movies, Catching Fire. His villainy ramps up here, with the conflict between him and series protagonist Katniss Everdeen becoming more personal, which does wonders to increase the stakes for a sequel that's even better than the first movie from 2012.\n\n9 'Pride & Prejudice' (2005)\n\nAnother 21st-century role of Donald Sutherland's is 2005's Pride & Prejudice sees him playing an entirely different role to the villainous one he played in the Hunger Games movies. As an adaptation of the Jane Austen novel of the same name, Pride & Prejudice is naturally a far gentler and not at all violent movie, revolving around a group of daughters all trying to find suitable husbands.\n\nThis adaptation is unlikely to win over anyone who's not already a fan of Austen's particular style of melodrama and romance, but it's a strong adaptation of the source material. It is also genuinely nice to see Sutherland play someone who's not either an anti-hero, shady, or outright villainous because most of his roles tend to fall into one of those camps.\n\n8 '1900' (1976)\n\n1900 is appropriately titled for two key reasons. The first and most obvious is that the decades-spanning story starts shortly after the titular year, with two boys born in 1901, growing up together, and then finding their bond challenged as they grow older. The second reason 1900 works as a title, on the other hand, is because it feels like it's 1900 minutes long.\n\nHarsh, but it's 317 minutes long: that puts it well over five hours, making it a huge, exhausting, but oftentimes impressive epic. Sutherland's also very memorable here, playing a truly vile character who does countless monstrous things, standing as perhaps one of the decade's most terrifying and underrated movie villains.\n\n7 'Klute' (1971)\n\nKlute is a movie that feels distinctly 1970s when it comes to tone and pacing, and is an example of a slow-burn mystery narrative done right. It stars Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland, with the former playing a call girl who's stalked by a terrifying and mysterious figure, leading to her enlisting the help of a private detective, played by Sutherland.\n\nThe film was a modest box office success, and continues to be held in high esteem as a very efficient and tense 1970s neo-noir/psychological thriller movie. It should also be noted that while Sutherland is good here, it's Fonda who ends up kind of stealing the show, and she also won a Best Lead Actress Oscar for her performance in the film.\n\n6 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1978)\n\nUpdating a 1950s science-fiction classic for the 1970s, complete with all the griminess and authenticity that entails, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a very impressive remake. It's slow-burn sci-fi/horror at its best, taking place in a small town where some mysterious forces seem to be taking over the bodies of many people living there, showcased by their odd behavior.\n\nIt's all quite subtle by today's standards, ramping up only around the final act, at which point Donald Sutherland gets to make that infamous face while pointing/screaming. But he is very good here and joined by numerous other actors who all deliver solid work, with the cast including Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum.\n\n5 'Animal House' (1978)\n\nIt's certainly a film of its time, but it's also hard to deny Animal House's impact as a comedy classic. It's crude, irreverent, and perhaps not something that's aged perfectly according to some, but it does capture a certain kind of comedic anarchy that's rarely been equaled since 1978, with its very loose plot about a fraternity full of troublemakers clashing with their college's dean.\n\nThe film belongs to its star John Belushi, but Donald Sutherland still has a memorable supporting turn here as Professor Jennings, filming for just two days and being its highest-paid star. Interestingly, though, he was initially offered a percentage of the film's gross instead of a flat fee, which he declined, thinking the film would flop. The decision apparently cost Sutherland millions due to Animal House's surprise success.\n\n4 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967)\n\nThough The Dirty Dozen isn't a remake of Seven Samurai the way The Magnificent Seven is, it does take the spirit of that 1954 classic action movie and transport it to a new setting. Said setting is World War II, and the \"heroes\" here aren't exactly great people, being convicted criminals who'll get their sentences reduced if they can survive a highly dangerous assassination mission behind enemy lines.\n\nThe film does a fantastic job of humanizing most of the titular dozen, and it helps that the forces they're up against are noticeably more evil. Donald Sutherland plays one of these anti-heroes, and it stands as arguably the first truly great film he ever appeared in, helping him go onto even bigger and better things in the years that followed.\n\n3 'Don't Look Now' (1973)\n\nOf all the horror movies made during the 1970s, few are as genuinely chilling and unsettling as Don't Look Now. It's a film that's more about the horrible feelings that come with intense grief, more than it is a movie about showing more traditional cinematic horrors (though it does lean into that more as it goes along and ends up being tremendously haunting in that regard, too).\n\nDonald Sutherland and Julie Christie star as parents rocked by a tragedy, with a trip to Venice together doing little to solve their sorrows and instead plunging the two into darker psychological territory. It's not an easy film to watch, but it is quite a remarkable experience in the end for those feeling up to watching something heavy.\n\n2 'Ordinary People' (1980)\n\nThe Oscar winner for Best Picture in 1980, Ordinary People is a family drama that's very compelling and fantastically acted. It's one of those rare movies where it feels like everybody in the cast is giving career-best performances, including Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton, and Judd Hirsch.\n\nNarratively, it follows a young man who's just lost his brother and two parents, grappling with the fact that they've also just lost a son. It's a heartbreaking kind of movie, dealing with the grief felt by the members of a family during a terrible time in their lives, but its honest look at the aftermath of a tragedy and the skill of its actors makes it a film worth watching.\n\n1 'JFK' (1991)\n\nBetween movies like JFK and Nixon, it's hard to deny that Oliver Stone makes some interesting (and politically charged) biopics/historical dramas. The former, in particular, is one of the most ambitious and engaging epics of the 1990s, following Jim Garrison, a district attorney, as he investigates the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, uncovering, in the process, what looks to be a dramatic conspiracy.\n\nIt's a huge movie, thanks to the narrative it tackles, the runtime it has, and the huge cast assembled. Donald Sutherland appears in a single (albeit lengthy) scene as the mysterious Mr. X, who's instrumental in explaining much of the conspiracy to Garrison and the audience. It's the best scene in a great film, thanks to Sutherland, and makes JFK arguably his best movie.\n\nKEEP READING: The Best Anthony Hopkins Movies, Ranked", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Alda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desertion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clint Eastwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-noir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-noir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Austen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Garrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Hirsch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judd Hirsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Belushi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Belushi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Adams_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Adams (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Goldblum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonard Nimoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Tyler Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

A rakish, loose-limbed 6\u2009ft 4\u2009in, with big ears, a toothy grin, prominent pale blue eyes and a hang dog expression, he might have been called ugly in conventional terms.\n\nAt the same time, though, he exerted a brooding sexual magnetism which many women found irresistible, and his lugubrious baritone voice was as instantly recognisable as James Mason's.\n\nHe was respected by his peers and by directors for his willingness to accept direction, and for his ability to bring his artistic intelligence to bear on absorbing a director's wishes. He believed that the actor's job is not to argue, but to be manipulated, an unusual view in Hollywood, where stars traditionally behave like autocrats.\n\nYet at the same time Sutherland was no cipher. Laid-back and likeably eccentric, he always insisted on a no-nudity clause in his contracts, on the grounds that he did not want the sight of his penis to destroy an audience's suspension of disbelief.\n\nSutherland's easy charm was best expressed in the character of Hawkeye Pierce, the oddball iconoclast in Robert Altman's Korean war satire M*A*S*H (1970), the film which catapulted him to stardom. Interestingly, Sutherland did not consider he had made the best of Altman's light-touch directing style, as he had not yet learnt his place as an actor, and insisted on playing the part his own way.\n\nHis perception of the actor's role was changed by the British director Nicolas Roeg, for whom he worked in his adaption of Daphne du Maurier's eerie horror tale Don't Look Now (1974). Sutherland had read the story and agreed to do it, but suggested to Roeg that it should have a happy ending. \"Do you want to do it or not?\" Roeg demanded brusquely. \"Because that's the film.\"\n\nSutherland went on to give one of his most memorable performances as the bereaved father haunted by visions of his recently drowned daughter. The film was particularly memorable for a torrid sex scene between Sutherland and his co-star Julie Christie, which was so realistic it left audiences wondering whether the two had become carried away and had actually done the deed.\n\nIn fact, the scene was a very good example of Sutherland's ability to take direction. As he recalled later, the two barely knew each other when they had to walk naked on to the set and lie on the bed: \"The director said: 'Right, Julie, pull your knees up to your shoulder. Donald, take your mouth and slide it down the inside of her left thigh.' It went on like this for 12 hours. Neither of us could speak afterwards.\"\n\nSutherland worked for some of the greatest directors of the 20th century, including Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, Louis Malle, John Schlesinger and Robert Aldrich.\n\nAmong other performances, he played the psychopathic private who impersonates a general in The Dirty Dozen; the star-struck clerk, Homer Simpson, in Schlesinger's The Day of the Locust; a fascist foreman in Bertolucci's 1900; the title role in Fellini's Casanova; the father struggling to keep his family together in Robert Redford's Ordinary People (1980); and an Afrikaner teacher who sees the light in A Dry White Season (1998).\n\nYet Sutherland's very versatility sometimes counted against him, and his name was conspicuously absent from the lists of Oscar nominations. His failure to build up a consistent image meant that he never had an identifiable following. Because no two of his roles were alike, audiences never knew what to expect when he was cast and formed no clear view of his personality.\n\nDonald Sutherland was born on July 17 1935 at St John, New Brunswick, and was raised in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, where his father ran the local bus, gas and elctricity company. As a child he suffered frequent bouts of ill health: he contracted polio when he was two and was confined to bed with rheumatic fever for a year at the age of 11.\n\nSutherland never visited the theatre as a child and at first he wanted to be a sculptor. But he was soon showing his potential as a performer, becoming Canada's youngest disc jockey aged 14 and winning local acclaim for his vivid radio portrayal of Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.\n\nHe still harboured ambitions to become a sculptor, though his father advised him to get a profession to fall back on and he entered Toronto University to study Engineering. His first taste of theatre came via a variety of roles in campus productions: his performance in The Tempest brought the attention of a Toronto Globe and Mail critic, who suggested to Sutherland that he consider an acting career.\n\nBy the end of his time at the university, he was so involved in acting, he failed his exams in accounting and statistics. He transferred to Victoria College and graduated in English.\n\nSutherland admired the versatility of British actors such as Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness and decided to train in Britain, rather than in America, believing that British acting schools instilled better discipline. He arrived in London in 1952 to study at Lamda, but found it \"snobby and unwelcoming\" and left a year later, after his voice coach advised him to become a lorry driver.\n\nHe then auditioned for the Perth Repertory Theatre and was taken on as their second lead, beginning an apprenticeship in British rep which took him all round the country. By 1961 he was appearing in television shows like The Saint and in 1963 he made his West End stage debut in August for the People with Rex Harrison and Rachel Roberts.\n\nThe following year he was cast in his first significant film role, Il Castello dei Morti Vivi (Castle of the Living Dead), an Italian horror movie directed by Warren Keifer, in which Sutherland had an early chance to demonstrate his versatility by playing a dual role as a young soldier and an old hag.\n\nHis performance in this otherwise unedifying piece was enough to convince various casting directors of his potential - at least for horror movies - and, after moving to America, Sutherland was soon appearing in a number of second-rate examples of the genre, including Dr Terror's House of Horrors and Die! Die! Darling! (both 1965).\n\nA move into more respectable fare came in 1967, when Robert Aldrich cast him as a slow-witted killer in the highly successful The Dirty Dozen. By the early 1970s, Sutherland had become an established star, thanks to his leading roles in Kelly's Heroes (1970), Start the Revolution Without Me (1969) and M*A*S*H (1970).\n\nIn 1971 he enhanced his reputation for versatility with a portrayal of a small town private detective in Alan J Pakula's Klute, from which his co-star Jane Fonda walked away with an Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nBy this time, Sutherland had become something of an idol for younger audiences, due to the kind of roles he took on and to his vociferous opposition to the Vietnam war. He had begun an affair with Jane Fonda during the filming of Klute and together they roamed the world, denouncing the war. In 1972 they made the anti-war documentary FTA. Sutherland continued his mainstream Hollywood work, enjoying success with Don't Look Now in 1973 as well as The Day of the Locust (1974) and Fellini's Casanova (1976).\n\nIn 1978, he won a permanent place in the hearts of ageing hippies with his portrayal of a pot-smoking, metaphysics-spouting college professor in National Lampoon's Animal House. Sutherland had been so convinced the film would be a failure that, when offered a percent of the gross profits or an upfront payment of $40,000, he took the upfront payment. Had he taken the gross percentage he would have earned $30-40 million. It was the sort of bad judgment that would be repeated on several occasions during his career.\n\nAfter the critically acclaimed Ordinary People (1980), in which almost the entire ensemble got Oscar nominations except for Sutherland, he entered a relatively unremarkable phase of his career, appearing in one forgettable film after another. He turned down starring roles in Deliverance and Straw Dogs because he did not agree with the violence, though he later admitted he had been wrong to do so.\n\nIn 1989, however, he won ecstatic reviews for his role in A Dry White Season and his title role in Bethune: The Making of a Hero.\n\nIn the 1990s, he was the informant who cried conspiracy in JFK (1991), a Van Helsing figure in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), a wealthy New Yorker who gets taken in by con artist Will Smith in Six Degrees of Separation (1993), and a general in the virus thriller Outbreak (1995).\n\nThe same year, he won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role in the television drama Citizen X. In 1998, he earned a Golden Globe nomination for his performance as the track coach in Without Limits, Robert Towne's film based on the life of the runner Steve Prefontaine. He won another Golden Globe in 2003 for the Vietnam-themed TV movie Path to War.\n\nIn 2000, he enjoyed further critical and commercial success with Space Cowboys, a good-natured adventure in which he teamed up with Tommy Lee Jones, Clint Eastwood and James Garner as geriatric astronauts who get another chance to blast into orbit.\n\nSutherland continued working into old age, his President Snow adding a silky, sinister presence to four instalments of the Hunger Games film series (2012-15); and last year he lent gravitas to the acclaimed Paramount+ Western miniseries Lawmen: Bass Reeves as \"Hanging\" Judge Parker.\n\nSutherland made his Broadway debut in 1981 in Lolita and appeared in 2000 at the Savoy Theatre, London, as a reclusive Nobel Prize-winning author in Enigmatic Variations, a translation by his son Roeg of a play by the French writer Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt. Neither play was a critical success, however.\n\nIn the 1970s he had turned down an offer to act in and invest in La Cage aux Folles which went on to be a spectacular Broadway hit. The decision was one which, he freely confessed, made him feel \"very stupid for a long time\".\n\nHe was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 2017.\n\nSutherland enjoyed expensive wines, but only drank claret after finding that Burgundy turned him \"into Oliver Reed\". He became a crusading non-smoker after discovering that he was allergic to smoke. He was devoted to his (third) family and to his Jack Russell, Ruby.\n\nSutherland was married three times, first, in 1959 (dissolved 1966) to Lois Hardwick, a Canadian actress whom he met during his time in Britain; secondly, in 1966 (dissolved 1971) to Shirley Douglas, another Canadian actress and daughter of Tommy Douglas, the leader of Canada's centre-left New Democratic Party; and thirdly, in 1990, to Francine Racette, a French-Canadian actress whom he had lived with since 1972.\n\nHe had a daughter and a son by Shirley Douglas and three sons by Francine Racette. All his sons (Angus Redford, Rossif, Roeg and Kiefer Sutherland, the actor) were named after film directors.\n\nDonald Sutherland, born July 17 1935, death announced June 20 2024", "source": {"uri":

No. 'Unattractive'\n\nBorn on July 17, 1935 in New Brunswick, northeastern Canada, Donald Edward McNichol Sutherland was a sickly child, suffering from hepatitis, polio and rheumatic fever.\n\n\"One leg's a little shorter, but I survived,\" he told Esquire magazine in 2011.\n\nAs an adult, he shot up to 6 foot 3 inches (1.93 meters), but was long aware that not everyone would consider him handsome.\n\n\"Unattractive is a gentler way of putting it,\" he responded when asked by CBS whether he considered himself ugly.\n\nAfter working as a part-time DJ for local radio as a teenager, he graduated from the University of Toronto in drama and engineering.\n\nOpting to pursue the theater against the wishes of his parents, he moved to London when he was 22 and later to Scotland.\n\nHe appeared in his first feature in 1964, the Italian gothic horror \"The Castle of the Living Dead.\" Small television roles followed, including on cult British series such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint.\"\n\nHis breakthrough came in 1967, after he moved to Hollywood, with Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen\" in which he starred alongside Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson as part of a World War II unit of violent misfits fighting the Nazis.\n\nFour years later came the hugely successful \"M*A*S*H,\" a wildly irreverent comedy about a group of army doctors in the Korean War, directed by Robert Altman.\n\nJane Fonda partnership\n\nSutherland started dating Jane Fonda in the 1970s and they appeared together in Alan J. Pakula's \"Klute,\" for which Fonda won an Oscar and Golden Globe.\n\nIn 1972, the couple starred in an anti-Vietnam war documentary, \"F.T.A.\"\n\nSutherland then made around a film a year for a while, including a series of modern gems such as Nicolas Roeg's harrowing child abduction drama \"Don't Look Now\" (1973) and Oliver Stone's biopic \"JFK\" (1991).\n\nHe worked with a host of top-drawer directors, including Bernardo Bertolucci, Federico Fellini and Clint Eastwood.\n\n'Hunger Games' dictator\n\nIn his later decades, Sutherland was best known as the tyrannical Coriolanus Snow, ruling over the post-apocalyptic state Panem in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise beginning in 2012.\n\nHe once said he hoped the films would give youngsters hope for \"a decent future.\"\n\nSutherland, an Emmy and Golden Globe winner, received an honorary Oscar in 2017, although he was never nominated for a competitive Academy Award.\n\nHe was given a star on Hollywood's storied Walk of Fame in 2011, saying at the ceremony that the honor meant more to him than a fancy gravestone.\n\n\"Getting old,\" he said in Esquire in 2011, \"is like having a new profession, except it's not a profession of your own choosing.\"\n\nAnd death will be \"a lonely little journey,\" he said.\n\nSutherland left five children from three wives, all of whom have worked in the film or television industry in some way.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland",

The actor, who famously starred in M*A*S*H*, Ordinary People, JFK, The Dirty Dozen, Klute, The Hunger Games, and so many more, was 88.\n\nHis son, an iconic actor in his own right, Kiefer Sutherland, broke the news on X:\n\nAccording to Deadline, the actor died in Miami after a long illness. This is an especially heavy blow for a Canadian such as myself. Growing up, he was one of those aspirational figures. Rising from humble origins in St. John's, New Brunswick, Sutherland made a name for himself in Europe before ever catching on in North America. He first made headway doing guest turns on British TV shows like The Avengers and The Saint before his breakout role in 1967's The Dirty Dozen. Originally, he was only supposed to have a small role. Still, the director, Robert Aldrich, gave him one of the film's most famous moments, where he impersonated a general when the actor who was supposed to do the bit gave him trouble. Within a few years, he was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, thanks to M*A*S*H*, Klute, Don't Look Now, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and so many others.\n\nIndeed, it's hard to do justice to his legacy in this obit, as the sheer volume of iconic roles he played is intimidating to list. One thing noteworthy is that he was widely considered the greatest living actor to have never even been nominated for an Oscar, which is hard to believe if you look at some of his work. Still, he received an honorary Oscar in 2017. For me, one that sticks out is Oliver Stone's JFK, where Sutherland turns up as Mr.X and delivers an incredible monologue blowing the lid of the Kennedy assassination conspiracy. How he didn't get a Best Supporting Actor nomination that year astounds me.\n\nSutherland's versatility served him well over the years. He was as comfortable as a leading man in everything from action (The Eagle Has Landed) to thrillers (Eye of the Needle) and beyond. He also famously co-starred in National Lampoon's Animal House as the teacher who introduces Delta House to marijuana, and in his later years, showed up in mentor roles in movies like A Time to Kill, The Italian Job, and many more. More recently, he became important to a whole new generation of moviegoers when he played the villain, Aldous Snow, in the Hunger Games series. On a more personal note, I met him at TIFF a few years ago, and I could tell him, as a Canadian, how much his work meant to me. I'm glad I approached him.\n\nWhat's your favorite Donald Sutherland role?

At the time, Sutherland had recently reconciled with his son Kiefer, AKA Jack Bauer from the thriller series 24: the two had little contact during the Kiefer's early life, but had just shot a film together, a western called Forsaken, in which they played an estranged father and son trying to patch up old wounds.\n\nBy turns thoughtful and gregarious, Sutherland was a dream interviewee. But because every answer was a story - related in that leathery Canadian baritone - the conversation flew, and just as he was getting on to the subject of his relationship with his son, a PR leapt out of the wardrobe and declared our time was up.\n\nA few days later, an email dropped into my inbox from someone calling themselves \"Frank Racette\". It was Sutherland. (His widow is the Canadian actress Francine Racette.) The loose end in our conversation had clearly been nagging at him, so he'd written 700 words on the subject of Forsaken and fatherhood - recalling his time with Fellini, quoting Larkin, and recalling classic Hollywood gossip in the process. At the end, he'd attached a photograph of him and Kiefer together on set.\n\nAt the time, I was stunned. Nine years later, reading back his words, I find myself inexpressibly moved. Sutherland wrote as he talked as he acted - which is to say with a controlled yet sensual magnetism, and also an intuitive feel for the strange join-the-dots nature of human experience. You can't walk away from a good Sutherland performance (or, as it turns out, email) without feeling that reality itself has been given a rattle, and its parts have fallen into some revealing new order - perhaps a comforting one, but more than likely not.\n\nHis lion-in-winter era yielded some tremendous work: not least that series of vital injections of gravitas and murk he gave to the Hunger Games franchise, and the fumbling paternal warmth he brought in the role of Mr Bennet to Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice. But it was his wolf-in-summer phase - Don't Look Now, Klute, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Day of the Locust, Ordinary People, Fellini's Casanova - that made Sutherland an indelible presence for generations of cinema-goers.\n\nI can't count the number of times I've watched Don't Look Now, but I'm still never quite prepared for the heart-splitting rawness of his performance as John Baxter - the bereaved father groping for solace in Venice, city of water and echoes, where every alley conspires to send him back to the anguish and grief only death can depose.\n\nAs the titular detective in Klute, meanwhile, Sutherland was so cautious and controlled that his character becomes as much of an enigma as the missing-person case he's been brought to New York City to solve. In a twitchy, surveillance-led story, Sutherland positions himself as a consummate watcher and waiter, giving almost nothing to a city that's liable to take everything you have.\n\nIn that hotel in 2015, I remember asking him about the possible snowballing effect of having played so many roles - whether from, say, President Snow he could disentangle strands of John Klute, John Baxter, Hawkeye Pierce, Matthew Bennell, Calvin Jarrett.\n\nOn the contrary, he said, it was nothing like that at all - and then the conversation veered elsewhere, and the thought was left incomplete.\n\nIn his email, he completed it.\n\n\"With respect to experience after all these years,\" he wrote, \"it's akin to the affairs of Casanova. Every time he fell in love, and he fell in love a lot, it was the first time and the last time. He's never been in love before.\n\n\"Time stopped. And then it started again. And then, after many liaisons, it was gone.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland",

How Many Kids Did He Have?", "body": "Donald Sutherland is a decorated Canadian actor with an impressive career that spanned several decades. While he never received an Academy Award nomination, he received two Golden Globes and a Primetime Emmy for his work. Sadly, he died in June 2024 at 88 years old. Here's what to know about his wife, Francine Racette, who survived him, as well as his past wives and five children.\n\nDonald Sutherland was married three times. He married his third wife, Francine Racette, in 1972 after meeting her on Alien Thunder, a Canadian drama.\n\nRacette was born in Quebec and worked as an actor. She appeared in American and French films throughout her career. Racette graduated from the National Theatre School of Canada in 1966 and became known for her performances in Au revoir les enfants, Lumi\u00e8re, and The Disappearance -- another film she starred alongside Donald. She retired from acting in the '80s.\n\nDonald's romance with his third wife came on the heels of a short-lived romance with Jane Fonda in 1971. They starred in Klute that same year and went to the Academy Awards together when Fonda won Best Actress for her role in the movie. Their relationship lasted until June 1972.\n\nDonald Sutherland married twice before embarking on his 50-year marriage to Francine Racette. In 1966, he married the late actor Shirley Douglas. They stayed together for four years before divorcing in 1970, and they welcomed twins during their marriage. Douglas is the famous actor Kiefer Sutherland's mother.\n\nDonald and Douglas reportedly had money troubles during their marriage. The actor made his first movie, The Castle of the Living Dead, in 1964 and didn't arrive in Hollywood until 1967.\n\n\"We had no money,\" Donald said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Donald called his friend and fellow actor Christopher Plummer for help.\n\n\"I woke him up,\" Donald explained to the publication in 2011. \"He loaned me $1,500. Incredible. We were on a Boeing 707 -- Shirley, her son Tom. Kiefer and [his twin] Rachel were probably 3 or 4 months old. I had a raincoat on, and I was holding Kiefer, and when we landed in Los Angeles, he threw up all over me.\"\n\nDonald's first wife was Lois Hardwick. The couple tied the knot in 1959 and stayed married for seven years before divorcing. Like her husband, Hardwick had an acting career and rose to fame as a child actor, starring in several Alice Comedies for The Walt Disney Company. Most notably, Hardwick was 18 years older than Donald.\n\nDonald and Hardwick got divorced in 1966, and she died two years later.\n\nDonald Sutherland had five children in total with his second wife, Shirley Douglas, and his third wife, Francine Racette. He and his first wife, Lois Hardwick, never had kids.\n\nKiefer and Rachel Sutherland, 57, are twins who had Douglas as their mother. Kiefer has a well-known acting career and is best remembered for his role as Jack Bauer in the drama 24. He announced his father's death on X. Rachel stays out of the spotlight but works in the entertainment industry as a production manager.\n\nDonald and Racette had their son, Roeg Sutherland, on Feb. 5, 1974. According to People, he reportedly works in the media finance division of the Creative Artists Agency, which oversees the \"packing and representation of independently financed films, television, and digital content.\"\n\nDonald and Racette had Rossif Sutherland on Sept. 25, 1978. While he didn't initially take an interest in acting, he always looked up to his father and eventually entered the industry. His performance in the 2016 film River earned him a nomination for a Canadian Screen Award.\n\nFinally, Donald and Racette had Angus Sutherland on Sept. 3, 1982. Angus also avoids the spotlight like Rachel, preferring to work behind the camera.\n\nDonald is also survived by four grandchildren, including actor Sarah Sutherland known for her role in Veep.\n\nElements of this article were originally reported by The U.S. Sun and HollywoodLife.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors":

He was also known for his recent portrayal of President Snow in The Hunger Games franchise.\n\nBorn on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Sutherland initially made his mark in 1967's The Dirty Dozen, where he played Vernon Pinkley. His big break came when director Robert Aldrich, recognizing his unique presence, expanded his role, turning the initially minor part into a memorable performance. This role set the stage for his future success in Hollywood.\n\nSutherland's versatility was evident in roles ranging from the sardonic Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's M.A.S.H. to the emotionally complex John Klute in \"Klute,\" opposite Jane Fonda.\n\nIn the 1970s, Sutherland became a countercultural icon, with standout roles in Kelly's Heroes, Little Murders, and SPYS. Despite his success, he was known for making eccentric career choices, turning down mainstream roles for projects like Alex in Wonderland and Johnny Got His Gun. And of course, he was one of a small cadre of actors that made what could have been an otherwise dreary little film called Invasion of the Body Snatchers into a sci-fi cult classic.\n\nOn television, Sutherland won an Emmy for his role in HBO's Citizen X and starred in series like Dirty Sexy Money, Commander in Chief, and The Pillars of the Earth.\n\nDonald Sutherland is survived by his wife, Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren. The family will hold a private celebration of his life, honoring a career that left a lasting legacy in both film and television.", "source": {"uri": "scifi.radio", "dataType": "news", "title": "SCIFI.radio - Scifi Fandom Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aldrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Aldrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counterculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_in_Wonderland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex in Wonderland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pillars of the Earth (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Got_His_Gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Got His Gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossif_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rossif Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Sexy_Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirty Sexy Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander in Chief (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://scifi.radio/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/donald-sutherland.avif?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 309}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

after Perth Rep snub", "body": "Losing the lead role in a Perth Rep production inadvertently sent Donald Sutherland on the road to Hollywood stardom.\n\nSutherland, who has died aged 88, following a long illness, had Scottish, as well as German and English, ancestry.\n\nHe left Canada in 1958 and studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art but quit after nine months.\n\nHe joined the Perth Repertory Theatre in 1960 and kicked off his season with the part of Heracles in The Rape of the Bell by Benn Levy.\n\n\"Here is a very nice moment and I don't want to go anywhere,\" he said.\n\nHe broke his toe on the first night of the first production but carried on regardless.\n\nThis was in the days when David Steuart and Marjorie Dence ran the theatre which was a place that left a lasting impression on actors as well as audiences.\n\nWith its ornate gold-leaf gilding, rich red walls and plush velvet seats, the elaborate 800-seater auditorium was a luxurious venue.\n\n\"I'll always be grateful for the time I spent at Perth Theatre,\" said Sutherland.\n\n\"It was my first real acting job and it gave me real confidence and security.\"\n\nIt was a fortnightly rep, not weekly, so Sutherland had more time to work on a role, and did everything from Shaw and Sheridan, to Pinter and Panto.\n\nFish and chips\n\nSutherland was hired for \u00a38 a week and the company also went on tour and performed various plays in Arbroath, Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy.\n\nWhile Arbroath may be internationally renowned for its smokies, Sutherland found the town also held the secret to a perfectly-battered haddock supper.\n\n\"The best fish and chips come from Arbroath,\" he said.\n\n\"The best fish and chips I've ever tasted.\"\n\nSutherland and his first wife Lois Hardwick found digs which they shared with another young actor who went on to make his mark.\n\nLittle did anyone at Perth Theatre then know just how well these two would do.\n\nSutherland and Hardwick rented the tiny cottage with Michael Sheard and his future wife Rosalind Moir and woke up one day with frozen bedsheets because it was so cold.\n\nSpeaking in 1990 Sutherland shivered at the memory of the cold in Perth.\n\n\"Canadians are used to cold but in Scotland they didn't build for cold,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd a two-room cottage near Bell's distillery and I'd wake up covered with frost.\"\n\nRoom-mate Sheard was born in Aberdeen and is best known for The Empire Strikes Back and playing the tyrant teacher Maurice Bronson in TV's Grange Hill in the 1980s.\n\nHe wrote a book about his experiences in 1997, entitled Yes, Mr Bronson: Memoirs of a Bum Actor, which described Sutherland as \"a super trouper\" at Perth Rep.\n\nHe said: \"I have a good claim, incidentally, to being the catalyst which set Donald Sutherland on the road to mega stardom.\n\n\"Later on in that season at Perth we did a production of Ibsen's Ghosts.\n\n\"Don desperately wanted to play the lead part of Oswald, but they gave it to me.\n\n\"As a result Don left Perth Rep in a huff and walked straight into a film career, starting with Hammer Horrors and followed very shortly by The Dirty Dozen!\"\n\nSutherland spent 18 months in Perth before returning to London.\n\nHe started picking up work in television and B-movies like Castle of the Living Dead before his big break came when director Robert Aldrich cast him in The Dirty Dozen.\n\n\"Originally, I'd just a walk-on part,\" said Sutherland.\n\n\"We were sitting around in a bar between takes - Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, John Cassavetes and the others, all with our heads shaved.\n\n\"Clint Walker started complaining to Aldrich that the scenes he was supposed to do, pretending to be a general, weren't appropriate.\n\n\"So Aldrich turned to me: 'Hey, you with the big ears, you do it'.\"\n\nHollywood producers saw star power in that brief role and his career took off.\n\nHe played leading men and all manner of misfits.\n\nHe appeared in classics like Kelly's Heroes, Klute, Don't Look Now and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nHe returned to Scotland in 1980 and spent eight weeks shooting on the Isle of Mull to film his role as a cold-blooded Nazi spy in thriller Eye of the Needle.\n\n\"I liked the character's discipline, his precision,\" he said in 1981.\n\n\"I liked his loneliness and his immorality.\"\n\nFilm credits in the 1980s and 1990s included Ordinary People, Threshold, Lock Up, JFK, Backdraft, Without Limits and Space Cowboys.\n\nSutherland traversed all mediums and genres all the way up to the recent blockbuster Hunger Games trilogy in which he played Professor Snow.\n\nHis steely turn as Katniss Everdeen's nemesis saw him attract a new generation of fans.\n\nSutherland was one of a string of star acts to have performed at Perth Theatre including Edward Woodward, Donald Pleasance, Russell Hunter and Ewan McGregor.\n\nHe retained a great affection for Perth until the end.\n\nMore like this:\n\nHow Dundee actress sang her way into the spotlight in The Wicker Man\n\nMy Old School: Story of schoolboy imposter who was exposed in Dundee to screen at Sundance",

Known for his work on Pride & Prejudice, The Hunger Games, MASH, and many more, Donaldson left an incredible mark in the entertainment industry and will always be remembered.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the Emmy Award winner passed away on Thursday in Miami after a \"long illness.\" His son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, 57, announced his passing on Instagram by sharing a black and white photo with his father and a touching statement. \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" he wrote in the caption. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived,\" he continued.\n\nDonald is survived by his five children and his wife, Francine Racette. He is the father to Rachel Kiefer's twin sister, who he welcomed into the world with his then-wife Douglas. He welcomed the rest of his children, Roeg, Rossif, and Angus, all of whom were named after directors he had worked with, with his third wife, Racette. She is 76.\n\nHis passing came a month ahead of what would have been an 89th birthday. The Canadian and Hollywood Walk of Fame inductee was born on July 17, 1936, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and got his taste for entertainment at a young age. His first was when he was 14 as a news correspondent for the local radio station CKBW.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Tororona with a double major in engineering and drama. After deciding to leave engineering in the past, he left Canada for Britain in 1957 to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He began to book small roles in British films and TV and by 1968, found success with his break-out role, The Dirty Dozen, which promoted him to leave London for Hollywood.\n\nDonald found himself the leading man throughout the 1970s' after appearing in Mash and Oddball in 1970, and the rest is history. He has 200 credits as an actor on IMDb.", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland",

Pakula .\n\nThe film is the highlight of Sutherland's partnership, both private and professional, with Fonda, who won an Oscar for her work.\n\n- 'JFK' (1991) -\n\nIn Oliver Stone's biopic, Sutherland played the chilling role of X, a shadowy intelligence figure who gives crucial information to a district attorney (Kevin Costner) investigating the politics surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\n- 'The Hunger Games' (2012) -\n\nSutherland glowered as the tyrannical President Coriolanus Snow, ruling over a post-apocalyptic state, in this blockbuster film and its sequels, delivering what The Hollywood Reporter called a \"sinister performance\".\n\nThe franchise is based on a series of best-selling young adult novels by Suzanne Collins.\n\njmy/br/sst\n\nMore from this section\n\nExplore Monster Hunter Now GPS Spoofing: MocPOGO Launches an Innovative 2024 Update\n\nFloify brings its industry-leading point-of-sale technology to The Mortgage Collaborative as a preferred partner\n\nCritical Defect Rate Declines Five Straight Quarters, Ending 2023 at 1.53%, Per ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@kulr8.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aldrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Aldrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bronson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Bronson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Marvin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Marvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

With his tall but gentle frame, subtle command of a room and a voice that my colleague Johanna Schneller perfectly described as the purr that a cashmere sweater would make if it could, Sutherland was the picture of dignified, curious, cut-your-heart-and-it-bleeds-maple-syrup Canadian hero. He also seemed to cherish his Hollywood work as much as he did his homegrown performances.\n\nObituary: Donald Sutherland was cinema's Canadian chameleon\n\nDonald Sutherland, a Canadian screen icon who enriched both Hollywood and his home country\n\nCanadian actor Donald Sutherland has died at age 88\n\nHere are five of the best, and where to watch them in Canada now:\n\nWatching Robert Altman's 1970 masterpiece today is a trip and a half, acting as much as an essential industry lesson in where and how Hollywood lost its go-for-broke gumption as much as it is a master class in what happens when the commitment of its on-screen performers matches the ambitions and energy of their director. A kind of epic study in tragicomedy, Altman's Korean War set film places Sutherland's army surgeon Hawkeye Pierce squarely in the thick of a subversive stew of human and historical error, with the actor fighting his way through the muck of his own and others' flaws to barely come out the other end with his soul intact.\n\nNicolas Roeg's thriller, adapted loosely from the 1971 Daphne du Maurier story, has inspired so many filmmakers today on the concepts and rules of 'trauma'-based drama that one might think its shocks and impact have naturally lessened in the intervening decades. That would be a foolish mistake to make, as encountering Roeg's film today is just as absorbing and flawless an experience as it must have been originally, with Sutherland and Julie Christie embodying all the million little flaws that we all hope to have hidden deep within ourselves, never to see light. On a trip to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, the parents played by Sutherland and Christie are a couple so torn asunder that their performances are almost painful to endure. Don't Look Now is such a rich film, though, that the hurt all adds up to a once-in-a-lifetime work of cinema worth any emotional injuries.\n\nIt is a true shame that Robert Redford has stepped back from all on-screen duties, as his expertly directed 1980 tearjerker serves as the platonic ideal of the melodrama. Following the careful, slow, devastating downfall of a well-to-do family in suburban Illinois after a series of tragedies, the film not only stays very carefully within the bounds of territory that could feel manipulative and exploitative, but it also gives its extraordinary cast so much emotional weight to lift that it feels as if the whole thing is a daring feat of strength. Sutherland does the heaviest work as the patriarch, but his performance might seem somewhat isolating if it weren't so delicately supported by Mary Tyler Moore as his equally emotionally destroyed wife and Timothy Hutton as their haunted son.\n\nGrowing up, I'm not sure there was another young adult in all of Canada more obsessed with Oliver Stone's JFK than me. I can't recall exactly how I was introduced to the 1991 film -- I had the habit of going to my local Blockbuster and grabbing any release whose length required two VHS tapes -- but very quickly I fell down Stone's rabbit hole. So much so that I coerced my father to drive me to a JFK conspiracy theorist talk at the local Chapters, and even shell out for two tickets to hear Stone himself give a guest lecture at the University of Toronto. And I cannot help but think so much of my attraction to Stone's film was in part owing to Sutherland's masterful appearance mid-film, in which the actor, playing \"Mr. X,\" is asked by his director to deliver a 10-minute-plus monologue detailing the entire history of the U.S. military-industrial complex. It is such a ridiculously paranoid role of conspiratorial fever dreams, but through his usual poise and dignified presence, Sutherland sells it with the slick confidence of a master manipulator.\n\nSutherland managed to reach into the nightmares of an entirely new generation with his performance as the cruel fascist manipulating The Hunger Games. While his deliciously evil villain President Snow was more of a background presence than a real player in the first three films, he really came to the fore in the fourth and final entry, casting such a magnificent shadow over Panem that it was pretty obvious how the country fell into such a dystopia.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Roeg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chameleon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragicomedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tragicomedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mysticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere_wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cashmere wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Platonic love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_du_Maurier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daphne du Maurier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melodrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Redford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Tyler Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

It's honestly a tragedy that he went unrecognized by the Academy Awards for any specific role, given his mastery with comedy, horror, sci-fi, and drama. While he did win an honorary Oscar in 2017 for his work, there are no shortage of performances which would have deserved such consideration.\n\nBelow are just 10 of them, though this list represents only the tip of the iceberg in terms of his body of work. Sutherland also was a memorable part of the ensemble in films like The Dirty Dozen, JFK, and Outbreak, and a star of other classic films across five decades. Up until his death at the age of 88, he was a memorable presence on screen, committing fully even to projects that might not have earned awards, but still entertained us all.\n\nIt's films like M*A*S*H that make it clear why Sutherland became something of an underground hero for the counterculture. Starring as the army surgeon \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, the actor is rebellious, masterful, and -- above all -- cool as hell. Undeniably, his portrayal of the doctor was a defining factor in transforming M*A*S*H from a humble war comedy to a long-running cultural franchise: An avid anti-war activist in reality, M*A*S*H and its debaucherous take on American culture couldn't have been a more perfect vehicle for the rising star. -- Jonah Krueger\n\nDonald Sutherland plays the title role in this classic thriller from Alan J. Pakula, which also stars Jane Fonda as a sex worker who might hold the clues to solving a man's disappearance. Fonda's performance was the one which attracted the most attention, but it was an early example of Sutherland's ability to make even a straightforward detective role compelling and engaging, especially because of his ability to connect with his co-star. -- L.S. Miller\n\nNicholas Roeg's revered work of psychological horror owes a lot to the intensity Sutherland knew how to bring to the screen, even in the role of a grieving parent trying to get his mind off the loss of his daughter with a nice trip to Venice. Don't Look Now is famous for both its ahead-of-its-time approach to editing as well as its ahead-of-its-time sex scene -- proof Sutherland was never afraid to push boundaries. -- L.S. Miller\n\nWith his portrayal of the pot-smoking, slightly mischievous, jaded English professor Dave Jennings, Sutherland continued his streak of immaculate acting and wildly charismatic performances. A surprisingly grounded character in the otherwise absurdist film, Sutherland successfully tapped into the type of professor we all wish we had.\n\n\"RIP the GOAT teacher in any school movie,\" user poopurpoop commented on this clip of what's perhaps his most memorable scene. Well said, Mr. Poopurpoop, well said. -- J.

CAA confirmed the news to Deadline.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nIn some of his most well-known roles, he perfected a laconic, wry and dead-serious delivery as such characters as the cool-headed amateur murder investigator John Klute, opposite Jane Fonda's terrified, erratic call girl Bree Daniels, in Klute; as the Hawkeye Pierce in the film MASH, where he played opposite Elliott Gould's cut-up Trapper John; and in Nicolas Reog's Don't Look Now as skeptical John Baxter, who does not believe the claims of wife Laura (Julie Christie) that their recently dead daughter is reaching out from the other side.\n\nIn one early change-of-pace characterization, Sutherland played a sadistic fascist in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1976 epic 1900, in which his character gleefully swings a child by the heels, bashing the boy's head against a wall.\n\nBorn on July 17, 1935, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Donald Sutherland amassed some 200 film and TV credits spanning more than 60 years, from guesting on episodes of 1960s series including Suspense, The Avengers, Court Martial and The Odd Man to last year's Paramount+ drama Bass Reeves. His big break in movies came with Robert Aldrich's star-packed 1967 World War II drama The Dirty Dozen, playing Vernon Pinkley opposite Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, George Kennedy, Telly Savalas and others. A hit in theaters, it remains a seminal American war movie.\n\nHis next big role was as Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in Robert Altman's 1970 Korean War dramedy MASH. The alternatively harrowing and hilarious film earned five Oscar nominations including Best Picture, winning for Ring Lardner Jr.'s biting screenplay, and fueled the 1972-83 CBS series in which Alda Alda played Hawkeye.\n\nSutherland followed that with another star-laden war movie, 1970's Kelly's Heroes, playing Sgt. Oddball alongside Clint Eastwood, Don Rickles, Savalas and others. That led to perhaps his biggest star turn, in the 1971 Alan J. Pakula crime drama Klute. He starred opposite Fonda as New York Detective John Klute, who is hired to find a chemical company executive who has disappeared. Fonda won her first Oscar for the role, and Andy Lewis & Dave Lewis were nominated for their Original Screenplay.\n\nSutherland's next big movie was Nicolas Roeg's psychological thriller Don't Look Now, which he followed up with the 1974 international espionage comedy S*P*Y*S, reteaming with Gould, and 1975's Hollywood-set Day of the Locust. Starring with William Atherton, Karen Black and Burgess Meredith, he played accountant Homer Simpson, who covets Black's aspiring actress Faye Greener.\n\nWith his film career in high gear, Sutherland starred in yet another big-name war movie in The Eagle Has Landed (1976), with Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, and then had a small role in the 1977 John Landis-directed farce The Kentucky Fried Movie, penned by future Airplane! filmmakers David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker.\n\n1978 would see Sutherland headline three disparate films: heist comedy The Great Train Robbery with Seaon Connery and Lesley-Anne Down; horror thriller remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Brooke Adams and Jeff Goldblum; and the beloved early-'60s fraternity romp Animal House, also directed by Landis\n\nHe had a supporting but key role in the latter, playing Faber College English lit Professor Dave Jennings. His deadpan character bores his classes with lectures on John Milton in one scene and is sleeping with student Katy (Karen Allen) in the next. She was the girlfriend of Boon (Peter Riegert), one of the Delta Chi fraternity members. The cast also included John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Stephen Furst, Bruce McGill, KEvin Bacon, Amadeus Oscar winner Tom Hulce and John Vernon.\n\nSutherland won a Golden Globe for the television movie Path to War, an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for his performance in the miniseries Citizen X. His extensive television credits also include The Undoing, Trust, Dirty Sexy Money, and The Pillars of the Earth, among many others.\n\nSutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette; sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer; daughter Rachel; and four grandchildren. A private celebration of life will be held by the family.\n\nMike Fleming Jr. and Greg Evans contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_pedersen@yahoo.com", "name": "Erik Pedersen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Survivor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated Survivor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julie Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernardo Bertolucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telly_Savalas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telly Savalas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Roeg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadomasochism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint John, New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Lardner_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ring Lardner Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

All About Francine Racette", "body": "Sutherland and Racette met while working on 1974 Western Alien Thunder together, and the two wed in 1972. Sutherland had been previously married two times, welcoming two of his children, Kiefer and Rachel, with his ex-wife, Shirley Douglas.\n\n\"She's an extraordinary human,\" he told The Guardian of Racette in March 2008. \"I think it's like Joanne Woodward said, 'Beauty goes and sex goes but my husband makes me laugh every single day.' And so does my wife. We laugh all the time.\"\n\nSo who is Donald Sutherland's wife? Here's everything to know about Francine Racette and her relationship with the late actor.\n\nRacette was born in Quebec and grew up in Canada. French is her first language and she has mainly starred in French-spoken films after graduating from the National Theatre School of Canada in 1966.\n\nLike her husband, Racette is also an actor, having starred in a number of productions such as Au revoir les enfants, Lumi\u00e8re and The Disappearance. In 1977, she was nominated for a C\u00e9sar award for best supporting actress for her work in Lumi\u00e8re.\n\n\"She was courted by intellectuals,\" Sutherland told The Guardian of his wife's career. \"[Playwright] Jean-Paul Sartre? She was his actress. She was [director] Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rossif's muse.\"\n\nSutherland split from his second wife, Shirley Douglas, in 1970. He had a relationship with actress Jane Fonda from then to 1972, until meeting Racette on the set of Alien Thunder.\n\nThe couple got married in 1972.\n\nBefore he married Racette, Sutherland was already a father to twins Kiefer and Rachel with Douglas, who were born in 1966. Two years after he and Racette tied the knot, they welcomed their first son together, Roeg, on Feb. 5, 1974. Sutherland and Racette then had two more sons together: Rossif, born on Sept. 25, 1978, and Angus born on Sept. 3, 1982.\n\nSutherland and Racette named each of their children after famous directors they revered.\n\n\"I love filmmakers, I really do,\" Sutherland said at the 2019 Lumi\u00e8re Film Festival, per Variety. \"They are part of my life, and I named my four sons after directors I worked with.\"\n\nAll of Sutherland's children ultimately worked in film and television, with Kiefer and Rossif following in his footsteps as actors and the rest working behind the scenes. Rachel is a production manager, while Roeg works for talent and sports agency Creative Artists Agency in the company's Media Finance division. Sutherland's youngest, Angus, works behind the camera as well.\n\nThough Sutherland's job took him around the world for filming and promotion, his priority was always to live with his wife, he told GQ in November 2014.\n\n\"When people ask me where I live, I say, 'I live with my wife,' \" he said. \"I don't know whether I live in Paris, New York, or Miami. I live with my wife.\"\n\nHe added that he makes that distinction because his wife is his main inspiration and guide.\n\n\"My inspiration, my judgment, it comes from my wife,\" Sutherland said. \"She has ... truth. And it's humbling. And so it's necessary that whatever ertions I make meet with her ... not necessarily her approval, but at least her acceptance.\"\n\nWhile starring in the U.S. adaptation of the play Enigma Variations in 1999, Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times that he didn't listen to his wife about adapting a play before, and he didn't plan on making the same mistake twice.\n\nHe said a few years before Enigma, a friend of Racette's in Paris tried to cast him in a new play that was being prepared for translation, but he refused -- and the play ended up being a great success.\n\n\"I went and looked at it and said, 'There's no way this play is going to run,' and I said, 'What is the title again?' \" he told LA Times in 1999. \"They said, La Cage aux Folles. I said, 'It will never work in the United States.' So, I decided to go with my wife's opinion this time.\"\n\nA few years later, when Racette suggested he take the lead role in Enigma Variations and acquire English translation rights, he agreed.\n\nWhen Sutherland found out he was going to be bestowed with an honorary Academy Award in 2018, he was eating a bowl of spaghetti while in Rome with Racette.\n\nWhile on the red carpet for the Oscars, Sutherland told Ryan Seacrest that when he got the call, he didn't recognize the number and at first gave a brusque \"Hello\" when he picked up. When he realized it was the president of the Academy and that he was being honored, he was shocked.\n\n\"We hung up and we sat there and then we didn't say anything,\" he said. \"My wife turned to me and she said, 'We're going to have to lose weight.' \"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francine_Racette", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francine Racette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutherland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi\u00e8re", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00e9sar_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C\u00e9sar Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Woodward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joanne Woodward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Theatre_School_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Theatre School of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumi\u00e8re_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lumi\u00e8re Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fonda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playwright", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playwright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Paul Sartre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_Variations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enigma Variations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cage_aux_Folles_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Cage aux Folles (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

He was 88 years old.\n\nSutherland died Thursday in Miami after a long illness, said CAA's Missy Davy. The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRemarkably, Sutherland was never even nominated for a competitive Oscar, although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made up for this oversight by presenting him with an honorary statuette in November 2017 at the Governors Awards.\n\nA prodigious actor who often appears in three to five films a year, the lanky Canadian-born star has demonstrated great autonomy over his six-decade career. His first characters, like crazy/dazed Pvt. Vernon Pinkley in The dirty dozen (1967), Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce, anti-establishment army doctor, in MASH POTATOES (1970) and the hippie tank commander Oddball in Kelly's heroes (1970), were mavericks.\n\nWith his distinctive baritone and crystal blue eyes, Sutherland was also effective in provocative roles, such as when he played a private detective who falls in love with a prostitute (his romantic partner at the time, Jane Fonda) in the film 'Alan J. Pakula. Clute (1971).\n\nIn Nicolas Roeg's horror thriller Don't look now (1973), he and Julie Christie wowed audiences in a peculiar bedroom scene, one of the steamiest sex sequences in cinema history. And for Federico Fellini, he played the role of Casanova in 1976.\n\nIt's Sutherland's turn to play the irreverent, martini-loving Hawkeye in MASH POTATOES opposite Elliott Gould in the role of \"Trapper\" John McIntyre brought him international fame at age 35.\n\n\"It showed the concept of war without showing war,\" he said of Robert Altman's classic film in a 1970 interview on the CBC show. Telescope. \"When you're in a field station like we were, it's insane to see human bodies flying into a camp that are destroyed for no reason. This kind of madness has created an environment, a sort of mini-society, plunged into chaos. For many people, this represents the type of society we have today.\n\nTaking a different approach, Sutherland was empathetic as a suburban Chicago lawyer trying to keep his family together in Robert Redford's firm. Ordinary people (1980) and as a compassionate doctor in Richard Pearce's film Threshold (nineteen eighty one). But here he was playing a manic arsonist in Ron Howard's film. Backdraft (1991).\n\nSutherland said he was continuing the role of the despotic President Snow in The hunger Games (2012) after his agent sent him the script. (He would return for all three sequels.)\n\n\"It wasn't offered to me,\" he said. said GQ in a 2014 interview. \"I love reading scripts and this captured my passion. I wrote them a letter. The role of the president may have had a line in the script. Maybe two. It made no difference. I thought it was an extremely important film and I wanted to be a part of it. I thought it might wake up an electorate that has been sleeping since the 70s.\n\n\"I hadn't read the books. To be honest, I didn't know them. But they showed my letter to the director, Gary Ross, and he thought it would be a good idea for me to do it. He wrote these wonderfully poetic scenes in the rose garden, and they formed the mind and spirit of Coriolanus Snow.\n\nInterviewed by Anderson Cooper in a 2017 profile for 60 minutes on finding inspiration in a role, Sutherland replied: \" I can not find it. It finds me. I mean, I'll read it. And suddenly it starts to bubble up inside me. And then it gets violent. And then it becomes affectionate. And it's an extraordinary thing. It's getting more and more exciting. It is delicious.\"\n\nDonald McNichol Sutherland was born July 17, 1935 in Saint John, New Brunswick. He had polio when he was very young, then missed fourth grade when he had to stay home because of rheumatic fever. His father, Frederick, was a salesman and his mother, Dorothy, a mathematics teacher.\n\nWhen he was 12, the family moved to Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, and he attended Bridgewater High School and then the University of Toronto, where he studied engineering and drama before receiving his degree in 1958.\n\nAfter working in regional theater in Ontario, he attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, but dropped out after a year, then spent five years practicing his craft in English and Scottish repertory theaters .\n\n\"My first offer for a film was in 1962,\" he said. GQ in a tale he often told. \"I auditioned for the producer, the writer, the director. And I came home and told my first wife, \"I thought everything went well.\" You never want to say you did well before you know anything.\n\n\"The next morning they were all on the phone saying how wonderful the audition was. And then the producer said, \"We loved you so much that we wanted to explain to you why we didn't cast you.\" We've always thought of it as a guy-next-door type character, and we don't think you look like you've ever lived next door to anyone.\n\nHe said he was self-conscious about his appearance. When he asked his mother if he was handsome, she replied, \"Your face has character.\" \"\n\nDuring the play Spoon River AnthologySutherland was approached by producer Paul Maslansky to star in The Castle of the Living Dead (1964), a low-budget horror film shot in Italy. He played a soldier, a witch and an old man.\n\nThe public noticed him when they saw him in The dirty dozen. In a scene with Lee Marvin and Robert Ryan, Pvt. Pinkley pretends to be a general and inspects the troops. Sutherland recalled that he was able to do the comic after another actor refused. \"You with the big ears, you do it,\" said director Robert Aldrich.\n\nCanadian actor Christopher Plummer lent him money to travel to the United States and producer Ingo Preminger signed him up for MASH POTATOESeven before Gould or Altman were hired.\n\n\"It was shot with undirected Arriflex cameras. We were alone in a room,\" he said. \"I don't know about Julie, but I'm never naked in front of anyone!\" I'm not even naked in front of my children. I'm naked in front of my wife, that's all. I was shy. For several very specific reasons, she was physically shy. But we overcame our shyness, walked into the room and stood like Adam and Eve waiting for someone to give us an apple.\n\nSutherland started his own production company, but quickly decided it wasn't in his best interest. \"For me, it's better to find a director who wants to make a film,\" he said.

Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family.\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in films including JFK (1991), Backdraft (1991), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Outbreak (1995), A Time To Kill (1996) and Instinct (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie Citizen X. In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed Cold Mountain (2003) and Pride & Prejudice (2005).\n\nIn the Hunger Games films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow.\n\n\"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017.\n\n\"It was funny at the beginning with 'The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person - always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?'

Sutherland was commanding and exacting, he gave each of his roles and films something special: he addressed his co-stars and the camera itself from a position of strength.\n\nEven playing a weak or absurd character, as he did starring as the preposterous womaniser in Federico Fellini's Casanova in 1976, finally reduced to the job of a librarian in a German count's castle, brooding grotesquely over the phantoms of past lovers, Sutherland was still strong, still mesmeric, his intelligent face still sympathetic as Casanova, even though resembling a non-priapic gargoyle. For Bertolucci in his Italian epic 1900, he played an actual fascist, the gruesomely named Attila, and though certainly very far from sympathetic, he played the role with a sickeningly twinkle-eyed dynamism.\n\nIn the latter years, he tended towards gravitas (and it's a shame there is no screen Lear from Sutherland) but in his heyday could convey bulging-eyed rage, joy, glee or malice - or a grinning satiric detachment, as he did in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H in 1970, as Hawkeye Pierce, the brilliant but irresponsible army field surgeon in Korea, a live-wire dissident, thrumming with directionless unused energy, rather different from the laidback drollery that Alan Alda settled into for the same part on TV.\n\nSutherland could do villainy or sensuality or the cares of a decent man bearing the burden of leadership or grief. He gravitated to complex leader roles and repeatedly directors found that it was Sutherland who had the intellectual seriousness and emotional maturity to play a complex father figure, a troubled paterfamilias - as in Robert Redford's Ordinary People and perhaps most sensationally of all, his role as the art historian John Baxter in Nic Roeg's Don't Look Now, the 1973 ghost story adapted from the short story by Daphne Du Maurier.\n\nSutherland's range in this movie is superb: he is heartrending as the man who has to pull his young daughter's dead body from the pond at the beginning - and deeply affecting as the husband who rebuilds his emotional and erotic relationship with his wife as they struggle to deal with their grief. He and Julie Christie gave us what I still think is the most natural and authentic \"married couple\" in movie history - and they famously starred in cinema's most remarkable sex scene; making love in a Venice hotel room to heal their emotional pain, the first time they have done so since their child's death, and this sequence is intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards, elegantly showing how commonplace and yet precious marital sex actually is. Perhaps it was Don't Look Now which made possible his role in Ordinary People, as the father dealing with the accidental death of one of his sons.\n\nIn 1971, Sutherland made his own decisive contribution to the unhappy American Zeitgeist with his lead role in Alan Pakula's noir-paranoia thriller Klute, playing the gumshoe detective of the title who puts Jane Fonda's call girl under surveillance, on the grounds that she may have something to do with a businessman's disappearance, and the movie lets us decide just how much of a kick Sutherland's hardbitten detective is getting out of this particular job, particularly he and Fonda are naturally to become involved. It is a fascinating performance, though perhaps as Sutherland did not precisely have the conventional movie-star sexiness of, say, Redford or his M*A*S*H co-star Elliot Gould (who memorably played a detective in Altman's The Long Goodbye) or the roughed-up method earthiness of a Hoffman or a De Niro or a Nicholson, his career played a little outside, or alongside, the A-list superstars of the era.\n\nBut his roles were always intensely flavoured with his indomitable personality as an actor: the repressed lovelorn accountant in John Schlesinger's The Day Of The Locust in 1975, even the dopey felon in Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen who is tasked with pretending to be a General - perhaps on the grounds that his natural low intelligence makes him well placed to imitate the mediocre officer class. It was a hint of anti-war satire that presaged M*A*S*H.\n\nIn his mature years, Sutherland often settled into potent cameos and supporting roles: but he was superbly cast in Six Degrees Of Separation as the man duped by Will Smith's character pretending to be the son of Sidney Poitier - intelligent, but fatally conceited.\n\nFor me, his most piercingly sad - and angriest - later role was the white South African schoolmaster in Euzhan Palcy's A Dry White Season who takes an initially diffident interest in the fact that his black gardener's blameless son has been taken away (and, we discover later, murdered) by the authorities - and he becomes radicalised realising that his whole life has been in the service of a racist ruling class, who all turn on him for siding against his own caste. It is sensational when Sutherland's character actually slaps the headmaster's face for calling him a \"traitor\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

He was 88.\n\nActor Kiefer Sutherland, one of Donald's five children, confirmed the news in an Instagram post on Thursday.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" he wrote. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nDonald's multi-decade screen career began on television, where he appeared in one-off episodes of shows like The Avengers and The Name of the Game. But his role as Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce Jr. in the 1970 film M*A*S*H kicked off his success on the big screen. Over the years, he would appear in dozens of movies, earning Golden Globe nominations for Ordinary People and Without Limits.\n\nHis many film credits also included Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Backdraft, Six Degrees of Separation, Space Cowboys and The Art of War, among others. More recently, he had a memorable turn in the four original Hunger Games films, where he co-starred as the villainous President Snow. Though Donald was never nominated for an Oscar, he did receive an honorary Academy Award in 2018 for his body of memorable work.\n\nDonald was equally prolific on the small screen, scooping up two Emmy nominations and one win (in 1995, for the TV movie Citizen X). Memorable TV credits included ABC's Commander in Chief (where he played Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton), ABC's Dirty Sexy Money (as Darling family patriarch Patrick \"Tripp\" Darling III) and FX's Trust (as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty). His final TV role was that of Judge Isaac Parker on the Paramount+ miniseries Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\n\nThe actor's TV accolades also included Golden Globe wins for Citizen X and the 2002 TV movie Path to War.", "source": {"uri": "tvline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVLine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_iannucci@tvline.com", "name": "Rebecca Iannucci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Game_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Name of the Game (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Separation_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Six Degrees of Separation (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Charles_Parker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Charles Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Getty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He was 88.\n\nCAA Media Finance, of which his son Roeg Sutherland is an executive, confirmed the tragic news to Deadline, revealing that the legendary actor passed in Miami on Thursday, June 20, after battling a long, unspecified illness.\n\nIn his upcoming memoir Made Up, But Still True, which is set for release on Nov. 12, the Outbreak actor opened up about his near-fatal battles with infantile paralysis, rheumatoid fever and spinal meningitis as a kid, though it's unclear at this time if they left him with any lasting impact that may have led to his passing.\n\nSon Kiefer Sutherland quickly broke his silence on his father's passing, calling him \"one of the most important actors in the history of film\" who had \"a life well lived.\"\n\nAfter overcoming his myriad childhood illnesses, he began acting on screen in the '60s, scoring a small role in The Dirty Dozen before hitting it big as Hawkeye in the film version of M.A.S.H.\n\nThroughout his career, he'd star in hits such as National Lampoon's Animal House, the film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Outbreak, Pride & Prejudice, The Hunger Games series, and more.\n\nDespite his illustrious career, he only ever won an honorary Academy Award for his career achievements, rather than for his work on any given film, and only racked up one Emmy and two Golden Globes.\n\nHe remained incredibly active up until the year before his death, with three releases in 2023: a film called Miranda's Victim, a children's flick called Ozi: Voice of the Forest, and his final production, a mini-series called Lawmen: Bass Reeves.\n\nSutherland's final project-to-be was Heart Land, which is still listed in pre-production on IMDb. He was cast as Rick.\n\nIn addition to Roeg and Kiefer, he is survived by sons Rossif and Angus, daughter Rachel, wife Francine, and four grandchildren.\n\nHis family will be holding a private celebration of life.\n\nNext: '9-1-1' Crew Member Rico Priem's Cause of Death Revealed Following His Post-Shift Car Crash", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sammi_burke@sacbee.com", "name": "Sammi Burke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (2021 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meningitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda's_Victim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miranda's Victim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMDb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "9-1-1 (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Honorary Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bass Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5ilo7t/picture289419800/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/cc2b9963-e15b-4ffd-b34d-c4ec8af3d172", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 250, "textEnd": 257}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 380, "textEnd": 387}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

But in 1972, his union with his third wife, Francine Racette, proved to be his greatest and final love. Donald and Francine married in 1972. The two Canadian actors reportedly met on the set of Alien Thunder and hit it off from there. Francine is an actor and starred in films like Lumiere, Goodbye, Children, and The Disappearance.\n\nBefore Donald married Francine, the actor walked down the aisle two other times. According to Hollywood Life, his third wife is the mother of only three of his five children. In 1967, he welcomed his first children, twins Rachel and Kiefer Sutherland. As some might already know, Kiefer followed in his dad's iconic footsteps with an acting career that spans over 30 years.\n\nDonald said in an interview with Scotland's The Daily Record that he wasn't \"present\" in Kiefer's life while he was growing up, per People. However, the two were reportedly close when he died, as Kiefer spoke highly of his father when he broke the news of his death.\n\n\"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,\" Kiefer wrote. \"I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nAfter welcoming Kiefer and Rachel, Donald and Francine had three children of their own -- Roeg, Rossif, and Angus. Like their dad and older brother, Roeg and Rossif pursued acting, and Roeg starred in Orphan: First Kill, in 2022.\n\nDonald's eldest children, Kiefer and Rachel, are now mourning both of their parents. The actor's second wife, Shirley Douglas, died of pneumonia complications in 2020. Like Donald, Shirley was an actor best known for her roles in Lolita, Dead Ringers, and Shadow Lake. Although their marriage didn't work out, they remained connected to have a better co-parenting relationship for their kids.\n\nBefore he met and married Shirley, Donald's first wife was Emmy-winning actor Lois Hardwick.

Donald's passion for filmmaking was so profound that it influenced the naming of his children.\n\nSpeaking at the Lumiere Festival, as reported by Variety, the Canadian actor previously shared: \"I love filmmakers, I really do.

Nicolas Roeg inspired the name of his second son, while his third son was named after industry friend Frederic Rossif.\n\nInterestingly, he wanted to name another son after Robert Redford, the director of Ordinary People, but faced opposition. He recalled: \"I wanted to name another son after Robert Redford, but when then the child was born [a woman at the maternity ward] said, 'No you can't do that, you can't name a child Redford.' So we named him Angus - Angus Redford.\", reports the Mirror US.\n\nKiefer, who Donald shared with ex-wife Shirley Douglas, has issued a heartbreaking statement following his father's passing. Donald shared sons Roeg, Rossif and Angus with his third wife, Francine Racette.\n\nThe 24 actor paid tribute to his father by sharing a black and white photograph of them together along with a touching message: \"With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film.\n\n\"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly.

His early roles, like crazed/dazed Pvt. Vernon Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen (1967), anti-Establishment Army doctor Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in M*A*S*H (1970), and hippy tank commander Oddball in Kelly's Heroes (1970), were rascally mavericks.\n\nSutherland's unique baritone and crystal blue eyes made him adept in daring parts, such as his portrayal of a private detective who falls for a prostitute (his then-real-life love partner Jane Fonda) in Alan J. Pakula's Klute (1971).\n\nIn Nicolas Roeg's 1973 horror flick Don't Look Now, he and Julie Christie teased moviegoers with one of the most heinous sexual scenes in film history.

Everyone should agree that he was a brilliant actor. But depending on what era of his career you're most familiar with, you might argue over whether he's best lionized as a character actor or a leading man.\n\nIn fact, he was both, in a way that seems not possible now, because he came into his career in an era when character actors were leading men.\n\nSutherland always had the aura of a character actor, because of his chameleonlike ability to shift between roles and his resilient capacity to elevate any material. Yet he was undeniably a leading man for much of his career, the headline star in many of his films, such as \"Klute\" and \"Ordinary People.\" The films of that era demanded character actors as their leads: actors with the deft ability to portray many facets of humanity. Now, many studios want to anchor a film on the particular brand of charisma that's already made an actor beloved.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People_(John_Legend_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordinary People (John Legend song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M*A*S*H (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leading actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charisma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/26/opinion/The-Point-Promo-Image/The-Point-Promo-Image-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668644", "eventUri": "eng-9668644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

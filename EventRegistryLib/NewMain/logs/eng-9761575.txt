The suspect's name was not immediately released.\n\nThe suspect was allegedly spotted just before 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday, pushing a car that was on fire down a gully called \"Alligator Hole\" in Bidwell Park, near Chico, Ramsey said.\n\n\"The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,\" Ramsey said in a statement.\n\nA man who was later identified as the suspect was seen calmly leaving the area by blending in with other park visitors fleeing the rapidly evolving fire, Ramsey said.\n\nThe suspect is scheduled to be arraigned next week, Ramsey said.\n\nThe Park Fire in Butte County, California, and the Durkee Fire in Oregon, the largest fire burning in the nation, continued filling West Coast skies Thursday with smoke as gusty winds and treacherous terrain were dealing challenges to firefighters battling both blazes, officials said.\n\nThe Park Fire started around 3 p.m. Wednesday northeast of the city of Chico in Bidwell Park and by Thursday had burned 45,550 acres, destroyed an undetermined number of structures and caused the Butte County Sheriff's Department to order evacuations for rural foothill communities in the area, including nearly the entire town of Cohasset, which has a population of about 400.\n\nMore than 1,100 firefighters were fighting the flames Thursday morning, using helicopters and cutting fire lines with bulldozers in a desperate attempt to prevent the fire from spreading to homes in the densely populated areas of north Chico, authorities said.\n\nThe Park Fire was just 3% contained Thursday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).\n\n\"The fire is well established. Fire personnel are currently focusing on evacuations and structure defense while concurrently building direct containment lines utilizing bulldozers, fire crews and fire engines,\" Cal Fire said in an updated statement Thursday morning. \"More resources have been ordered and are inbound from various areas throughout Northern California.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\n\nAt least 3,800 people were under evacuation orders in Butte and Tehama counties, officials said.\n\nThe Park Fire rapidly grew into the state's largest conflagration this wildfire season, surpassing the Lake Fire near Santa Barbara in Southern California that started on July 5. As of Thursday morning, the Lake Fire had burned 38,664 and was 90% contained, according to Cal Fire. The blaze destroyed four structures and left at least six firefighters injured, Cal Fire reported.\n\nThe Butte County blaze was one of 64 new fires that erupted in California Wednesday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nRick Carhart, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, told ABC News Thursday that hot temperatures and steep, rugged terrain in the burning area are making things difficult for firefighters.\n\nCarhart -- who described the fire activity as \"dynamic\" -- said the temperature in the area this week has been 100 to 110 degrees.\n\nOfficials said that in the first 12 hours of the fire, flames were burning 4,000 acres per hour.\n\n\"It's very, very hot. It's bone dry and pretty much every spark that hits the ground is going to start a fire,\" Carhart said.\n\nHe said the area where the fire is most active hasn't burned in 20 years, providing an abundance of dry vegetation that is feeding the blaze.\n\nCal Fire officials said the number of acres burned so far in this wildfire season is 15 times more than at this time in 2023. There have been nearly 800 more fires this year compared to last, including 54 that resulted in arson arrests, according to Cal Fire.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The blaze destroyed four structures and left at least six firefighters injured, Cal Fire reported.\n\nThe Butte County blaze was one of 64 new fires that erupted in California Wednesday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nRick Carhart, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, told ABC News Thursday that hot temperatures and steep, rugged terrain in the burning area are making things difficult for firefighters.\n\nCarhart -- who described the fire activity as \"dynamic\" -- said the temperature in the area this week has been 100 to 110 degrees.\n\nOfficials said that in the first 12 hours of the fire, flames were burning 4,000 acres per hour.\n\n\"It's very, very hot. It's bone dry and pretty much every spark that hits the ground is going to start a fire,\" Carhart said.\n\nHe said the area where the fire is most active hasn't burned in 20 years, providing an abundance of dry vegetation that is feeding the blaze.\n\nCal Fire officials said the number of acres burned so far in this wildfire season is 15 times more than at this time in 2023. There have been nearly 800 more fires this year compared to last, including 54 that resulted in arson arrests, according to Cal Fire, in\n\nDurkee fire is largest in the nation\n\nIn Oregon, the Durkee Fire in Baker County, which was sparked by a lightning strike on July 17, had grown to nearly 270,000 acres, or about 400 square miles, as of Thursday morning. The fire burning near the Idaho border was 0% contained and had spread into neighboring Malheur County, according to the Oregon Fire Marshal's Office.\n\nOregon Gov. Tina Kotek announced on Wednesday that she has invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act to increase resources to battle the Durkee Fire and the Battle Mountain Complex Fire, which consists of three active fires that have burned a total of about 64,000 in the same area of Umatilla County in Eastern Oregon.\n\nKotek said she has also deployed the National Guard to the Durkee and Battle Mountain fires.\n\nKotek said in a statement that resources necessary for fighting the fires are beyond local capabilities.\n\n\"The wildfires in Eastern Oregon have scaled up quickly,\" Kotek said. \"We are facing strong erratic winds over the region that could impact all fires. Rain is not getting through. Some communities do not have power. The situation is dynamic, and the teams on the ground are taking it day by day. I have deployed resources from the National Guard that are currently serving eastern and southwestern Oregon. I know these communities are supporting one another, doing their part to heed the guidance from officials and showing tremendous gratitude for our firefighters.\"\n\nKotek said the Durkee fire has merged with another large fire in the area, the Cow Valley Fire, creating one monster-size blaze.\n\nThe Baker County Sheriff's Office said evacuation orders for residents living in the fire zone, including all 500 residents of the town of Huntington.\n\nDuring a community briefing Wednesday night, fire officials said the Durkee fire was burning so hot it had created its own weather system.\n\nJonathan Chriest, a National Weather Service meteorologist assigned to the Durkee fire, said at a briefing that wind gusts fanning the fire were expected to reach 75 mph Wednesday night.\n\nTemperatures in the area have been in the high 90s to triple-digits. Chriest said a cold front was moving into the area of the Durkee Fire that could lower temperatures through the weekend but could bring northwest winds of 30 to 45 mph and flash flooding.\n\n\"That fire has just not cooperated with us in terms of the weather. I don't like making excuses and I don't like fires outpacing me, so that's a hard thing to admit,\" Tyson Albrecht of the U.S. Forest Service, the incident commander on the Durkee Fire for Northwest Team 6, said at the briefing. \"This fire and the weather that we've been experiencing has been really challenging. It will continue to challenge us, but we will continue to keep swinging away out there to minimize those impacts.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [],

No fatalities have been reported. The cause of the fire, currently only 3% contained, is under active investigation.\n\nSome communities are in immediate danger said Rick Carhart, public information officer with Cal Fire and the Butte County Fire Department. \"Cohasset and Forest Ranch are under evacuation orders now, so the structures in those areas are in immediate threat and we're hopeful that everybody has heeded the evacuation orders.\"\n\nPlease see the CalFire website for the latest fire perimeter maps and evacuation information.\n\nWhere in California is the Park Fire?\n\nThe blaze started at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday near Upper Park Road in Upper Bidwell Park, east of Chico.\n\nHow big is the Park Fire?\n\nAccording to CalFire this is the largest blaze in the state this year, currently at 71,489 acres and only 3% contained as of 1:30 p.m. local time Thursday. 2024's second largest fire is the Lake Fire near Santa Barbara which has burned at least 38,000 acres but is now 90% contained.\n\nHow many structures has the Park Fire destroyed?\n\nThe blaze as of Thursday afternoon destroyed four structures and left at least six firefighters injured, Cal Fire reported according to ABC News.\n\nButte County Sheriff's Department has ordered evacuations for rural foothill communities ncluding the town of Cohasset, which has a population of about 400.\n\nWebcam shows Park Fire spreading rapidly in Butte County\n\nIn addition to unfavorable firefighting weather conditions -- gusty winds and low humidity, this area has not had a fire in a number of years, Carhart said. \"These two areas of Butte County are areas that we have been looking at for a while as being pretty threatening as far as having a big wildfire because there's essentially no fire history in the area so there's nothing in the past for a number of years that has burned off the undergrowth and the brush has just been growing which fuels fires making them much more dangerous.\"\n\nPark Fire burns over 45,000 acres in 14 hours\n\nAfter weeks with temperatures in triple-digits the fire grew rapidly. \"In well less than 12 hours the fire grew to 45,000 acres,\" said Carhart. \"Our first units at scene reported 4 to 5 acres. Next, we heard it was 50 and then all of a sudden it was 500, 6,400 acres and then I believe 4 hours after that it was 45,000.\"\n\n\"We've got investigators working on finding the origin and the cause of the fire as we speak,\" Carhart said. According to the Chico Enterprise-Record, a 42-year-old man has been arrested under suspicion of committing arson by pushing a burning car into a gully.\n\nFirst-responders are focused on evacuations and defensive measures including lines of containment utilizing bulldozers, fire crews and fire engines, according to CalFire. Additional personnel and resources, including air tankers are inbound from various areas across the state. It remains unclear how many structures have burned.\n\nCarhart says there are an estimated 1,100 people working the fire.\n\nWhere is wildfire smoke and air quality at its worst?", "source": {"uri":

The cause of the fire, currently only 3 percent contained, is under active investigation.\n\nSome communities are in immediate danger said Rick Carhart, public information officer with Cal Fire and the Butte County Fire Department. \"Cohasset and Forest Ranch are under evacuation orders now, so the structures in those areas are in immediate threat and we're hopeful that everybody has heeded the evacuation orders.\"\n\nPlease see the CalFire website for the latest fire perimeter maps and evacuation information.\n\nWhere in California is the Park Fire?\n\nThe blaze started at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday near Upper Park Road in Upper Bidwell Park, east of Chico.\n\nHow big is the Park Fire?\n\nAccording to CalFire this is the largest blaze in the state this year, currently at 71,489 acres and only three percent contained as of 1:30 p.m. local time Thursday. 2024's second largest fire is the Lake Fire near Santa Barbara which has burned at least 38,000 acres but is now 90 percent contained.\n\nWebcam shows Park Fire spreading rapidly in Butte County\n\nIn addition to unfavorable firefighting weather conditions -- gusty winds and low humidity, this area has not had a fire in a number of years, said Carhart.\"These two areas of Butte County are areas that we have been looking at for a while as being pretty threatening as far as having a big wildfire because there's essentially no fire history in the area so there's nothing in the past for a number of years that has burned off the undergrowth and the brush has just been growing which fuels fires making them much more dangerous.\"\n\nPark Fire burns over 45,000 acres in 14 hours\n\nAfter weeks with temperatures in triple-digits the fire grew rapidly. \"In well less than 12 hours the fire grew to 45,000 acres,\" said Carhart. \"Our first units at scene reported 4 to 5 acres. Next, we heard it was 50 and then all of a sudden it was 500, 6,400 acres and then I believe 4 hours after that it was 45,000.\"\n\nHow did the Park Fire start?\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation. \"We've got investigators working on finding the origin and the cause of the fire as we speak,\" said Carhart. According to the Chico Enterprise-Record, a 42-year-old man has been arrested under suspicion of committing arson by pushing a burning car into a gully.\n\nFirst-responders are focused on evacuations and defensive measures including lines of containment utilizing bulldozers, fire crews and fire engines, according to CalFire. Additional personnel and resources, including air tankers are inbound from various areas across the state. It remains unclear how many structures have burned.\n\nCarhart says there are an estimated 1,100 people working the fire.\n\nWhere is wildfire smoke and air quality at its worst?", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butte County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butte County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehama_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehama County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehama County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Ranch,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forest Ranch, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Forest Ranch, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohasset,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cohasset, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cohasset, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidwell_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bidwell Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico_Enterprise-Record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chico Enterprise-Record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Understory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulldozer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerial firefighting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Occupations", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Occupations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/25/USAT/74550329007-parkfiretopper-2-x.png?auto=webp&crop=6994,3936,x0,y200&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761575", "eventUri": "eng-9761575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

No fatalities have been reported. The cause of the fire, currently only 3% contained, is under active investigation.\n\nSome communities are in immediate danger said Rick Carhart, public information officer with Cal Fire and the Butte County Fire Department. \"Cohasset and Forest Ranch are under evacuation orders now, so the structures in those areas are in immediate threat and we're hopeful that everybody has heeded the evacuation orders.\"\n\nPlease see the CalFire website for the latest fire perimeter maps and evacuation information.\n\nThe blaze started at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday near Upper Park Road in Upper Bidwell Park, east of Chico.\n\nAccording to CalFire this is the largest blaze in the state this year, currently at 71,489 acres and only 3% contained as of 1:30 p.m. local time Thursday. 2024's second largest fire is the Lake Fire near Santa Barbara which has burned at least 38,000 acres but is now 90% contained.\n\nThe blaze as of Thursday afternoon destroyed four structures and left at least six firefighters injured, Cal Fire reported according to ABC News.\n\nButte County Sheriff's Department has ordered evacuations for rural foothill communities ncluding the town of Cohasset, which has a population of about 400.\n\nIn addition to unfavorable firefighting weather conditions -- gusty winds and low humidity, this area has not had a fire in a number of years, Carhart said. \"These two areas of Butte County are areas that we have been looking at for a while as being pretty threatening as far as having a big wildfire because there's essentially no fire history in the area so there's nothing in the past for a number of years that has burned off the undergrowth and the brush has just been growing which fuels fires making them much more dangerous.\"\n\nAfter weeks with temperatures in triple-digits the fire grew rapidly. \"In well less than 12 hours the fire grew to 45,000 acres,\" said Carhart. \"Our first units at scene reported 4 to 5 acres. Next, we heard it was 50 and then all of a sudden it was 500, 6,400 acres and then I believe 4 hours after that it was 45,000.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation.\n\n\"We've got investigators working on finding the origin and the cause of the fire as we speak,\" Carhart said. According to the Chico Enterprise-Record, a 42-year-old man has been arrested under suspicion of committing arson by pushing a burning car into a gully.\n\nFirst-responders are focused on evacuations and defensive measures including lines of containment utilizing bulldozers, fire crews and fire engines, according to CalFire. Additional personnel and resources, including air tankers are inbound from various areas across the state. It remains unclear how many structures have burned.\n\nCarhart says there are an estimated 1,100 people working the fire.\n\nActive fire, smoke and air quailty maps: Where is wildfire smoke and air

One of the factors of that was the fire got into areas with little to no burn history, and there's very heavy vegetation. These areas are not easily accessible to ground resources.\"\n\nBidwell Park is among the largest municipal parks in the country, and it's often touted as the crown jewel of Chico. Collins said a portion of the park's eastern edge has burned.\n\nThe explosive fire triggered a flurry of evacuations Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Evacuation maps showed residences under warnings and orders in Butte County and Tehama County. (You can also find information from the Butte County and Tehama County sheriff's departments).\n\nCollins said there are some zones within Chico that are under evacuation warning, but downtown Chico was not threatened.\n\nIf you are monitoring the fire, you can watch the live-streamed cameras on AlertCalifornia. As of early Thursday morning, the fire was 3% contained.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Francisco Gate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_graff@sfgate.com", "name": "Amy Graff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidwell_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bidwell Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishi_Wilderness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ishi Wilderness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehama_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehama County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehama County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butte County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butte County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFGATE", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SFGATE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriffs_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriffs in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/02/46/25438649/5/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761575", "eventUri": "eng-9761575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

According to the Watch Duty App, an additional 10 engines and six crews were requested by the incident commander.\n\nThe fire was initially described in the app as being a vegetation fire with a moderate rate of spread and was heading uphill into the canyon.

Wildfire 45,000 acres amid evacuations near Chico", "body": "A Northern California blaze exploded Thursday to more than 45,000 acres -- the largest wildfire in California this year -- spanning two counties, as residents were ordered to evacuate areas north of Chico.\n\nFirefighters have contained just 3% of a 45,550-acre blaze dubbed the Park Fire burning across Butte and Tehama counties after sparks ignited Wednesday in the open spaces of Upper Bidwell Park on the outskirts of Chico. More than 216 personnel are battling the flames that consumed structures as Incident Management Team 3 was tasked to take over command later this morning.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office ordered the evacuation of areas around Musty Buck Ridge as wind spurred flames toward Cohasset, a community of 900 residents. Winds billowed up to 20 mph, with gusts reaching 23 mph, in Upper Bidwell Park about 8 p.m. Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nFirefighters and residents acted quickly to dodge the flames as the fire made Cohasset Road impassable. Authorities led a group of 20 vehicles uphill toward Campbellville to safety. Another 80 vehicles were guided by trucks on small logging roads in Sierra Pacific Industries forest lands, according to radio dispatches reviewed Wednesday night by The Sacramento Bee. Cameras operated by PG&E in the AlertCalifornia wildfire surveillance network showed flames devouring a communications tower along Richardson Springs Road as flames raced through river canyons and over ridges. The transmission cut out a few moments later.\n\nFlames on Wednesday reached 6,465 acres at about 10:30 p.m. but grew more than seven times larger by Thursday morning. The rapid spread of the blaze was due in part to the fire burrowing into heavily inaccessible parts, said Capt. Dan Collins, a spokesman for Cal Fire and Butte County Fire Department.\n\nDeploying ground resources to those heavily wooded parts proved \"challenging\" especially as flames charred regions with little to no fire history, Collins said. The vegetation provided lots of fuel for embers to ignite, especially as high temperatures raged, he said. Collins didn't have a total number of structures that have burned.\n\nGusts could reach 21 mph Thursday in Chico, with an estimated high of 102 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office placed the following zones were under evacuation orders: 120, 149, 150-A, 250, 251-253, 260, 261, 262, 265, 266, 268, 269, 271, 311, 312, 317 and 318. It includes areas of Forest Ranch, Cohasset and Carpenter ridges. The area also includes the Chico Municipal Airport.\n\nThe following zones were under evacuation warnings in Butte County: 252 and 253, 273, 314, 315 and 316.\n\nThe Tehama County Sheriff's Office ordered zones 736, 854, 856, 858, 882, 882-A and 882-B to leave the area. Residents in zones 726, 728, 732, 734 and 852 were under an evacuation warning.\n\nAn evacuation center was set up at Neighborhood Church, 2801 Notre Dame Blvd. in Chico. Small animals may be taken to a shelter at 2279 Del Oro Ave., in Oroville and large animals can be brought to safety at Camelot Equestrian Park, 1985 Clark Road in Oroville.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol's office in Susanville closed Highway 32 at Highway 36 due to the fire with no estimated time of reopening. More resources from around Northern California expected to descend on the region to douse flames, according to Cal Fire.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

triggered by man", "body": "The Park fire has prompted mass evacuation in northern California\n\nThe largest wildfire in California so far this year was apparently caused by a man's strange and selfish behavior.\n\nAn unidentified 42 year old from Chico was allegedly caught pushing a car that was on fire into a gulley in upper Bidwell Park just before 3pm on Wednesday, the Butte County District Attorney's Office announced.\n\nThe vehicle then tumbled 60 feet down an embankment, sparking the blaze - which engulfed more than 71,000 acres of northern California overnight and prompted mass evacuations, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.\n\n'The man was seen calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire,' the District Attorney's Office said.\n\n'Cal Fire arson investigators responded, secured the scene and began to search for clues to identify the unknown man.'\n\nAn unidentified 42 year old man allegedly started a California wildfire after he pushed a car that was on fire into a gulley\n\nThe Park fire in Butte County has engulfed 71,000 acres - making it the largest in the state so far this year\n\nAuthorities ultimately identified the suspect early Thursday morning, and took him into custody.\n\nHe was then booked into the Butte County Jail, where he is being held without bail, according to the District Attorney's Office, which said it will release the man's name later on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1,100 firefighters are now battling the Park Fire - up from just 200 firefighters on the front lines at dawn.\n\nThe Chico Fire Department has said it is using every fire engine in the city, and agencies from across northern California are on their way to assist, according to KCRA.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has also announced it is authorizing federal funding to help combat the fire as it continues to destroy homes and other structures.\n\nMore than 1,100 firefighters are now battling the Park Fire - up from just 200 firefighters on the front lines at dawn\n\nThe fire was just 3 percent contained as of Thursday evening\n\nThe extent of the damage from the Park Fire remains unclear, as Cal Fire officials have yet to start tallying the number of destroyed structures.\n\nBut authorities have said it is the largest fire that California has seen all year, and the fifth-largest in the state over the past three years.\n\nMore than 3,500 people have already been displaced as evacuation orders remain in place for large swaths of areas in Butte and Tehama counties, with multiple other areas in each county were under evacuation orders as of Thursday evening.\n\nAt the time, the fire was just 3 percent contained at that time - though officials worry it will soon spread to more populated areas, as fire conditions ramp up.\n\nMore than 3,500 people have already been displaced as evacuation orders remain in place\n\nForecasters for the National Weather Service have warned there could wind gusts of up to 30mph that could push the fire further north.\n\nCombined with low humidity and temperatures in the mid-90s to low-100s through Friday evening, the forecasters say that 'can cause new fire starts and ongoing wildfires to... grow rapidly and dangerously in size and intensity.'\n\nAdditionally, strong southeast winds up the Sacramento Valley, combined with strong southwest winds atop ridges could allow the fire to 'breathe,' which could result in it spreading even more rapidly, the Chronicle reports.\n\nFirefighters have said they are being hindered by the area's steep terrain, and are using aircrafts to help put out the blaze\n\nThe fire is now burning north into the Ishi Wilderness and Lassen foothills, which experts say has not seen any fire activity in decades - if not a century.\n\n'Once it got into that area, it had a lot of fuel to consume,' Dan Collins, a spokesman for the Butte Unit of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThere, the fire was able to eat through new grasses that sprang up in the wake of two back-to-back wet winters, Zeke Lunder, a Chico-based fire specialist and geographer explained.\n\nBut it really accelerated once it reached higher vegetation, with live oaks and grapevines that spit out embers as they burn that can be carried in the wind to start new fires.\n\nThe fire has already destroyed some homes and other structures in its path\n\nThe extent of the damage is not yet clear, as officials have yet to tally the number of destroyed structures\n\nThe blaze is now expected to continue to grow in the days ahead, Lunder said, noting that it's not unusual for fires of this size to double in acreage every day.\n\n'It's a big one,' he said.\n\n'Unless you can get people out there on the ground to put in fire lines, aircraft alone aren't necessarily going to put this fire out - and the area where it's burning into is extremely rough' with steep, inaccessible terrain.\n\nCollins even admitted the fire crews are having trouble getting resources into the edges of the fire, which has the potential to spread into the town of Cohasset - which Lunder said would be the 'worst case scenario' and could lead to major structure loss.\n\nCollins says more containment is now needed to protect the nearby communities, and further evacuation orders may be issued.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

It quickly reached nearly 6,500 acres by Wednesday night, as local officials scrambled to get threatened residents to safety, according to CAL Fire in Butte County. The fire has since grown to over 45,000 acres and remains only 3% contained.\n\nWitnesses spotted a man pushing a burning car down an embankment moments before the fire began, according to Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey. The car rolled 60 feet downhill, where it eventually burned up, spreading flames into the nearby brush.\n\nFrom there, the wildfire took off, setting off urgent evacuations. Ramsey says the arsonist tried to blend in with the others who were scrambling to evacuate.\n\nHowever, investigators were later able to identify their suspect, who was arrested and booked into the Butte County Jail on Thursday morning. Ramsey said he's currently being held without bail until a Monday court appearance.\n\nSUGGESTED:\n\nMeanwhile, evacuated residents have been offered shelter at a church in Chico.\n\nMore than 200 firefighters are on the scene and more are on the way from throughout Northern California, according to CAL Fire.\n\nThose firefighters are battling wilting triple-digit summer heat and dry, breezy conditions.

More than 4,000 people had been evacuated by Thursday morning, according to Megan McMann, a spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe Park fire grew exponentially as it raced north parallel to Highway 99 and into Tehama County.\n\nThe man arrested on suspicion of arson was booked into the Butte County Jail on Thursday morning, where he's being held without bail, the district attorney's office said.\n\nFollowing the \"dynamic fire activity overnight,\" crews went into Thursday expecting to battle the flames while negotiating persistent winds and temperatures that could reach 110 degrees during the day and remain in the 80s at night -- factors that promote rapid fire growth, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's latest update.\n\n\"The forecast is for more hot, dry weather with a steady breeze from the south again,\" the agency said Thursday morning.\n\nThe National Weather Service also issued a red flag warning for the northern Sacramento Valley, including where this fire is burning. Forecasters warned there could be wind gusts up to 30 mph pushing the fire north combined with low humidity through Friday evening that \"can cause new fire starts and ongoing wildfires to ... grow rapidly and dangerously in size and intensity.\"\n\nFirefighters remained focused on assisting evacuations and protecting structures until additional crews arrived, though no buildings had been confirmed damaged as of Thursday morning, said Dan Collins, a spokesperson for the Butte Unit of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe other major factor in this fire, he said, is its location, burning north into the Ishi Wilderness and Lassen foothills, which experts say hasn't seen fire activity in decades, if not a century.\n\n\"Once it got into that area, it had a lot of fuel to consume,\" Collins said.\n\n\"A lot of us who work in fire have kind of been waiting for this fire to happen for the last 25 years,\" said Zeke Lunder, a Chico-based fire specialist and geographer. He said the lack of recent fires has made the area a jackpot for flames.\n\nThe fire initially began chewing through new grasses that sprang up in the wake of two back-to-back wet winters, Lunder said, but it really accelerated once it reached heavier vegetation, such as live oak and grapevines that spit out red-hot embers as they burn and that can be carried in the wind and start new fires.\n\nThe area also includes a lot of steep, inaccessible terrain, which has hindered firefighters' response.\n\n\"Some of the challenges were just getting resources into the edge of the fire,\" Collins said. There's been some better progress on the fire where it's burning closer to developed areas, but it's still far from under control, he said.\n\n\"The southwesterly portion of the fire, the crews were able to get in there last night ... and establish some control lines,\" Collins said. But he said more containment is needed to protect nearby communities, and further evacuation orders could be issued.\n\nCal Fire listed the fire at 45,549 acres Thursday morning with 3% containment. Residents in northeast Chico, Forest Ranch and some smaller mountain areas, including the hamlet of Cohasset, have been ordered to evacuate, according to the Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe fire's massive expansion was particularly unusual to see overnight, Lunder said. The fire made a huge run after dusk on Wednesday -- throwing up a massive column of smoke and flames -- as it began to align with faults and ridges in the Lassen foothills, he said.\n\n\"Even though it was going across the canyons, there's all these little side canyons, and so it was kind of a perfect setup,\" Lunder said.\n\nHe said the blaze is likely to continue growing in the hours and days ahead, noting that it's not unusual for fires of this size to double in acreage every day.\n\n\"It's a big one,\" Lunder said. \"Unless you can get people out there on the ground to put in fire lines, aircraft alone aren't necessarily going to put this fire out -- and the area where it's burning into is extremely rough.\"\n\nAnd while the fire is primarily burning in low-country grass and brush, there's potential for it to burn up in the Cohasset Ridge and become \"a lower elevation version of the Dixie fire,\" Lunder said, referring to the 2021 blaze that burned about 963,000 acres -- the second-largest wildfire in California history.\n\nThe fire also has echoes of the Camp fire, Lunder said, which devastated the nearby town of Paradise in 2018 and killed 85 people. Fortunately, the Park fire's explosion has -- so far -- occurred away from heavily populated areas.\n\n\"If we had a city of 30,000 people in the [Lassen] foothills, it would have had a Paradise-type experience yesterday,\" Lunder said. \"This fire so far has threaded the needle through this area with pretty low-density development. The 45,000-acre footprint is exceptional in the lack of structures.\"\n\nBut that could change in an instant, as many Californians know all too well. There is potential for the blaze to grow into the more developed area of Cohasset on Thursday, which would be a \"worst case scenario\" that could lead to major structure loss, Lunder said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state has secured a fire management assistance grant from the federal government, which provides significant financial support for firefighting and communities affected by wildfires, resources that can be quickly put to use.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com",

Investigators arrested a suspected arsonist who allegedly pushed his burning car down a gully in a park outside of Chico, Butte County authorities said.\n\nFirefighters have contained just 3% of the 71,489-acre (111 square miles) blaze, dubbed the Park Fire, burning across Butte and Tehama counties after sparks ignited Wednesday in the open spaces of Upper Bidwell Park on the outskirts of Chico. The wildfire, recorded by Cal Fire at 6,465 acres around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, grew seven-fold overnight to 55,000 acres before the latest acreage update at noon.\n\nThe suspect in the arson, who was arrested on a warrant issued Thursday, pushed a car down a gully near Alligator Hole, a swimming hole at the park, shortly before 3 p.m. Wednesday, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said. The vehicle fell about 60 feet and burned completely, prosecutors said. Authorities said they would release the suspect's name Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office ordered the evacuation of areas around Musty Buck Ridge as wind spurred flames toward Cohasset, a community of 900 residents. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release more than 3,500 people were uprooted from their homes.\n\nFirefighters, loggers and residents acted quickly to dodge the flames as the fire made Cohasset Road impassable. Authorities led a group of 20 vehicles uphill toward Campbellville to a helipad. Another 80 vehicles were guided by trucks on small logging roads in Sierra Pacific Industries forest lands, according to radio dispatches reviewed Wednesday night by The Sacramento Bee.\n\n'Everyone was just really helpful, looking out for each other'\n\nNikko Shelton and his family live on Cohasset Road and were told to go by 6 p.m. He and his wife escaped in two cars, his with the dog, Luther, the other driven by Melissa with two cats in tow. They were among the 40 evacuees in a caravan of 20 vehicles trying to dodge the flames while navigating treacherously narrow unpaved roads.\n\nShelton said dust clouded his view and others struggled to stay on the road. One vehicle was pulled out after slipping into a ditch, another car was abandoned outright, he said.\n\nDespite the tribulations, Shelton said he believed everyone made it out OK.\n\nHe said the family got their first evacuation notice about 5:30 p.m. and were told to leave a half-hour later. By 7:30 p.m., the family and 10 other cars reached the welcome sign at the entrance to Cohasset only to be told to turn around and get out through the logging roads.\n\nA \"very helpful gentleman\" from the logging company drove past the caravan, alerting them that the road had been cleared and gates that were closed had been opened. A second Sierra Pacific worker led them to the helipad above the town and \"took a leadership role to get everyone together,\" instructed people how to organize vehicles. They formed a convoy to get out. If any vehicle had trouble, they were told to honk so they could move to the front of the pack.\n\nSix miles up the narrow road, the convoy stopped at a logging encampment to regroup. At that point, they the evacuees heard more homes were being told to get out, Shelton said.\n\nThe convoy reached Highway 32 around 9 p.m. and headed north toward Chester. He said the loggers made the difference in saving lives.\n\n\"Honestly, for the most part, everyone was just really helpful, looking out for each other,\" he said. \"You know, a couple vehicles didn't have very much gasoline and they were all willing to offer up what they had.\"\n\nNow the Sheltons await the fate of their home, which they believed was still standing.\n\n\"It looks like the fire line that was established at Sigler Road is about two miles below my house, so hopefully we're all good,\" he said Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for SPI Industries confirmed in a statement that employees and contractors helped Cohasset-area residents evacuate.\n\nPark Fire burning in steep, inaccessible terrain\n\nThe rapid spread of the blaze was due in part to the fire burrowing into heavily inaccessible parts, said Capt. Dan Collins, a spokesman for Cal Fire and Butte County Fire Department. Winds billowed up to 20 mph, with gusts reaching 23 mph, in Upper Bidwell Park about 8 p.m. Wednesday amid an imminent red flag warning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nDeploying ground resources to those heavily wooded parts proved \"challenging\" especially as flames charred regions with little to no fire history, Collins said. The vegetation provided lots of fuel for embers to ignite, especially as high temperatures raged, he said. Collins didn't have a total number of structures that have burned.\n\nA red flag warning -- issued when a combination of warm temperatures, low humidity and strong winds -- was expected to last from 1 p.m. Thursday until 11 p.m. Friday in Butte and Tehama counties.\n\nSmoke drifted through trees and burned structures around Wells Island and Cohasset roads. Small flames still sputtered Thursday morning, destroying some structures.\n\nFirefighters saved Odyssey Winery & Vineyards, 6237 Cohasset Road, but charred cars and homes were more common while traversing up Cohasset Road.\n\nAll that remained of a family-owned reptile store, Killer Clutches, 44 Rock Creed Road, were darkened pillars and a small frog leaping through blackened containers and cages.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced the state secured a federal grant to provide financial aid by allowing \"local, state and tribal agencies responding to the fire to apply for 75-percent reimbursement of their eligible fire suppression costs,\" according to a news release.\n\nGusts could reach 21 mph Thursday in Chico, with an estimated high of 102 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Cameras operated by PG&E in the AlertCalifornia wildfire surveillance network showed flames devouring a communications tower along Richardson Springs Road on Wednesday as flames raced through river canyons and over ridges. The transmission cut out a few moments later.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office placed the following zones were under evacuation orders: 120, 149, 150-A, 250, 251-253, 260, 261, 262, 265, 266, 268, 269, 271, 311, 312, 317 and 318. It includes areas of Forest Ranch, Cohasset and Carpenter ridges. The area also includes the Chico Municipal Airport.\n\nThe following zones were under evacuation warnings in Butte County: 252 and 253, 273, 314, 315 and 316.\n\nThe Tehama County Sheriff's Office ordered residents in zones 694-B, 726, 732, 734, 736, 852, 854, 856, 858, 882, 882-A and 882-B to leave the area. Residents in zones 694-A, 720, 726, 728, 732, 734, 840, 850-A and 852 were under an evacuation warning.\n\nAn evacuation center was set up at Neighborhood Church, 2801 Notre Dame Blvd. in Chico. Small animals may be taken to a shelter at 2279 Del Oro Ave., in Oroville and large animals can be brought to safety at Camelot Equestrian Park, 1985 Clark Road in Oroville.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol's office in Susanville closed Highway 32 at Highway 36 due to the fire with no estimated time of reopening. More resources from around Northern California expected to descend on the region to douse flames, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe cause is under investigation, Cal Fire said.\n\n____\n\n\u00a92024 The Sacramento Bee.

The car reportedly rolled approximately 60 feet down an embankment, where it \"burned completely\" and spread into the 45,000-acre Park Fire.\n\nThe office said the man was then seen leaving the area by blending in with others nearby who were fleeing the blaze.\n\nInvestigators with Cal Fire's arson unit secured the scene to search for clues to uncover the man's identity, and he was \"eventually identified,\" Ramsey said in a news release.\n\nA judge issued a warrant for the man early on Thursday, and he was booked into the Butte County Jail, where he will stay until he is arraigned in court on Monday. County officials said his name will be released later on Thursday.\n\nA woman named Elizabeth Fox uploaded a video to TikTok on Wednesday saying she saw the man \"blow up his car and then put it in neutral and roll it down the hill, and take off like nothing happened.\" In the video, Fox said she took a photo of the man leaving the scene and gave a statement to investigators.\n\nAs of 11:30 a.m. Thursday, the video has more than 670,000 views and 75,000 likes.\n\nThe District Attorney's Office encourages anyone who has information or was in the Alligator Hole area between noon and 3 p.m. on Wednesday is to call Cal Fire investigations at 530-538-7888.", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "camila_pedrosa@sanluisobispo.com", "name": "Camila Pedrosa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ramsey_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Ramsey (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ditch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidwell_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bidwell Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alligator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Levee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ramsey County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ramsey County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butte County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butte County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/rvy1pg/picture290427064/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/DA%20fire%20photo.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761575", "eventUri": "eng-9761575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Wildfire now 71,000 acres as residents near Chico escaped flames", "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A Northern California blaze exploded Thursday to more than 71,000 acres across two counties -- quickly become the largest wildfire in the state this year -- forcing thousands to evacuate. Investigators arrested a suspected arsonist who allegedly pushed his burning car down a gully in a park outside of Chico, Butte County authorities said.\n\nFirefighters have contained just 3% of the 71,489-acre (111 square miles) blaze, dubbed the Park fire, burning across Butte and Tehama counties after sparks ignited Wednesday in the open spaces of Upper Bidwell Park on the outskirts of Chico. The wildfire, recorded by Cal Fire at 6,465 acres around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, grew seven-fold overnight to 55,000 acres before the latest acreage update at noon.\n\nThe suspect in the arson, who was arrested on a warrant issued Thursday, pushed a car down a gully near Alligator Hole, a swimming hole at the park, shortly before 3 p.m. Wednesday, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said. The vehicle fell about 60 feet and burned completely, prosecutors said. Authorities said they would release the suspect's name Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office ordered the evacuation of areas around Musty Buck Ridge as wind spurred flames toward Cohasset, a community of 900 residents. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release more than 3,500 people were uprooted from their homes.\n\nFirefighters, loggers and residents acted quickly to dodge the flames as the fire made Cohasset Road impassable. Authorities led a group of 20 vehicles uphill toward Campbellville to a helipad. Another 80 vehicles were guided by trucks on small logging roads in Sierra Pacific Industries forest lands, according to radio dispatches reviewed Wednesday night by The Sacramento Bee.\n\n'Everyone was just really helpful, looking out for each other'\n\nNikko Shelton and his family live on Cohasset Road and were told to go by 6 p.m. He and his wife escaped in two cars, his with the dog, Luther, the other driven by Melissa with two cats in tow. They were among the 40 evacuees in a caravan of 20 vehicles trying to dodge the flames while navigating treacherously narrow unpaved roads.\n\nShelton said dust clouded his view and others struggled to stay on the road. One vehicle was pulled out after slipping into a ditch, another car was abandoned outright, he said.\n\nDespite the tribulations, Shelton said he believed everyone made it out OK.\n\nHe said the family got their first evacuation notice about 5:30 p.m. and were told to leave a half-hour later. By 7:30 p.m., the family and 10 other cars reached the welcome sign at the entrance to Cohasset only to be told to turn around and get out through the logging roads.\n\nA \"very helpful gentleman\" from the logging company drove past the caravan, alerting them that the road had been cleared and gates that were closed had been opened. A second Sierra Pacific worker led them to the helipad above the town and \"took a leadership role to get everyone together,\" instructed people how to organize vehicles. They formed a convoy to get out. If any vehicle had trouble, they were told to honk so they could move to the front of the pack.\n\nSix miles up the narrow road, the convoy stopped at a logging encampment to regroup. At that point, they the evacuees heard more homes were being told to get out, Shelton said.\n\nThe convoy reached Highway 32 around 9 p.m. and headed north toward Chester. He said the loggers made the difference in saving lives.\n\n\"Honestly, for the most part, everyone was just really helpful, looking out for each other,\" he said. \"You know, a couple vehicles didn't have very much gasoline and they were all willing to offer up what they had.\"\n\nNow the Sheltons await the fate of their home, which they believed was still standing.\n\n\"It looks like the fire line that was established at Sigler Road is about two miles below my house, so hopefully we're all good,\" he said Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for SPI Industries confirmed in a statement that employees and contractors helped Cohasset-area residents evacuate.\n\nPark fire burning in steep, inaccessible terrain\n\nThe rapid spread of the blaze was due in part to the fire burrowing into heavily inaccessible parts, said Capt. Dan Collins, a spokesman for Cal Fire and Butte County Fire Department. Winds billowed up to 20 mph, with gusts reaching 23 mph, in Upper Bidwell Park about 8 p.m. Wednesday amid an imminent red flag warning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nDeploying ground resources to those heavily wooded parts proved \"challenging\" especially as flames charred regions with little to no fire history, Collins said. The vegetation provided lots of fuel for embers to ignite, especially as high temperatures raged, he said. Collins didn't have a total number of structures that have burned.\n\nA red flag warning -- issued when a combination of warm temperatures, low humidity and strong winds -- was expected to last from 1 p.m. Thursday until 11 p.m. Friday in Butte and Tehama counties.\n\nSmoke drifted through trees and burned structures around Wells Island and Cohasset roads. Small flames still sputtered Thursday morning, destroying some structures.\n\nFirefighters saved Odyssey Winery & Vineyards, 6237 Cohasset Road, but charred cars and homes were more common while traversing up Cohasset Road.\n\nAll that remained of a family-owned reptile store, Killer Clutches, 44 Rock Creed Road, were darkened pillars and a small frog leaping through blackened containers and cages.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced the state secured a federal grant to provide financial aid by allowing \"local, state and tribal agencies responding to the fire to apply for 75-percent reimbursement of their eligible fire suppression costs,\" according to a news release.\n\nGusts could reach 21 mph Thursday in Chico, with an estimated high of 102 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Cameras operated by PG&E in the AlertCalifornia wildfire surveillance network showed flames devouring a communications tower along Richardson Springs Road on Wednesday as flames raced through river canyons and over ridges. The transmission cut out a few moments later.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office placed the following zones were under evacuation orders: 120, 149, 150-A, 250, 251-253, 260, 261, 262, 265, 266, 268, 269, 271, 311, 312, 317 and 318. It includes areas of Forest Ranch, Cohasset and Carpenter ridges. The area also includes the Chico Municipal Airport.\n\nThe following zones were under evacuation warnings in Butte County: 252 and 253, 273, 314, 315 and 316.\n\nThe Tehama County Sheriff's Office ordered residents in zones 694-B, 726, 732, 734, 736, 852, 854, 856, 858, 882, 882-A and 882-B to leave the area. Residents in zones 694-A, 720, 726, 728, 732, 734, 840, 850-A and 852 were under an evacuation warning.\n\nAn evacuation center was set up at Neighborhood Church, 2801 Notre Dame Blvd. in Chico. Small animals may be taken to a shelter at 2279 Del Oro Ave., in Oroville and large animals can be brought to safety at Camelot Equestrian Park, 1985 Clark Road in Oroville.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol's office in Susanville closed Highway 32 at Highway 36 due to the fire with no estimated time of reopening. More resources from around Northern California expected to descend on the region to douse flames, according to Cal Fire.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Purdue said the winds appear to have a \"diurnal pattern,\" meaning they are strongest in the afternoon and evening, but reduce overnight and pick back up the following day.\n\nThe red flag also covers most of the upper Sacramento Valley and includes Redding, Marysville, Yuba City, as well as high desert spots such as Susanville and Alturas.\n\nIn a spot forecast for the Park Fire, the weather service reported \"critical fire weather conditions\" are expected to continue through Friday, with wind gusts from the south at up to 30 mph continuing to fan the flames.\n\nThe Park Fire, which is already the state's largest wildfire this year after it sparked Wednesday afternoon in Upper Bidwell Park, ballooned in size overnight and was 45,550 acres and 3% contained Thursday morning, Cal Fire's Butte County unit said. Multiple evacuations are in place for homes northeast of Chico.\n\nSaturday is expected to bring cooler temperatures, diminished winds and higher humidity. The high is forecast to be in the 80s, with humidity reaching 30%.

According to the Watch Duty App, five additional engines were requested for the fire at 3:11 p.m.\n\nThe fire was initially described in the app as being a vegetation fire with a moderate rate of spread and is heading uphill into the canyon.", "source": {"uri": "chicoer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chico Enterprise-Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_hutchison@chicoer.com", "name": "Jake Hutchison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dan_reidel@chicoer.com", "name": "Dan Reidel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feather River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia-Pacific", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oroville,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oroville, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oroville, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_70", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Route 70"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural rubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidwell_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bidwell Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canyon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chico, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Blackpowder", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Blackpowder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.chicoer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chico-site-icon-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761575", "eventUri": "eng-9761575", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oroville, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

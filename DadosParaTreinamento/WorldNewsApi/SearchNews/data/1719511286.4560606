Their encampment north of the city of Idlib hasn\u2019t seen any aid in six months. \u201cWe used to get food aid, hygiene items,\u201d said the mother of four. \u201cNow we haven\u2019t had much in a while.\u201d Al-Salim\u2019s story is similar to that of many in this region of Syria, where most of the 5.1 million people have been internally displaced - sometimes more than once - in the country\u2019s civil war, now in its 14th year, and rely on aid to survive. U.N. agencies and international humanitarian organizations have for years struggled with shrinking budgets, further worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and conflicts elsewhere. The wars in Ukraine and Sudan, and more recently Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip are the focus of the world\u2019s attention. Syria\u2019s war, which has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country\u2019s pre-war population of of 23 million, has long remained largely frozen and so are also efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates across the country\u2019s front lines. Along with the deepening poverty, there is growing hostility in neighboring countries that host Syrian refugees and that struggle with crises of their own. Aid organizations are now making their annual pitches to donors ahead of a fundraising conference in Brussels for Syria on Monday. But humanitarian workers believe that pledges will likely fall short and that further aid cuts would follow. \u201cWe have moved from assisting 5.5 million a year to about 1.5 million people in Syria,\u201d Carl Skau, the U.N. World Food Program\u2019s deputy executive director, told The Associated Press. He spoke during a recent visit to Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees - and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented. \u201cWhen I look across the world, this is the (aid) program that has shrunk the most in the shortest period for time,\u201d Skau said. Just 6% of the United Nations\u2019 appeal for aid to Syria in 2024 has so far been secured ahead of Monday\u2019s annual fundraising conference organized by the European Union, said David Carden, U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria. For the northwestern region of Syria, that means the U.N. is only able to feed 600,000 out of the 3.6 million people facing food insecurity, meaning they lack access to sufficient food. The U.N. says some 12.9 million Syrians are food insecure across the country. The U.N. hopes the Brussels conference can raise more than $4 billion in \u201clifesaving aid\u201d to support almost two-thirds of the 16.7 million Syrians in need, both within the war-torn country and in neighboring countries, particularly Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. At last year\u2019s conference, donors pledged $10.3 billion - about $6 billion in grants and the rest in loans - just months after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and much of northern Syria, killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. For northwestern Syria, an enclave under rebel control, aid \u201cis literally a matter of life and death\u201d this year, Carden told the AP during a recent visit to Idlib province. Without funding, 160 health facilities there would close by end of June, he said. The International Rescue Committee\u2019s head for Syria, Tanya Evans, said needs are \u201cat their highest ever,\u201d with increasing numbers of Syrians turning to child labor and taking on debt to pay for food and basics. In Lebanon, where nearly 90% of Syrian refugees live in poverty, they also face flagging aid and increasing resentment from the Lebanese, struggling with their own country\u2019s economic crisis since 2019. Disgruntled officials have accused the refugees of surging crime and competition in the job market. Lebanon\u2019s bickering political parties have united in a call for a crackdown on undocumented Syrian migrants and demand refugees return to so-called \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria. U.N. agencies, human rights groups and Western governments say there are no such areas. Um Omar, a Syrian refugee from Homs, works in a grocery store in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli - an impoverished community that once warmly welcomed Syrian refugees. For her work, she gets to bring home every day a bundle of bread and some vegetables to feed her family of five. They live rent-free in a tent on a plot of land that belongs to the grocery store\u2019s owners. \u201cI have to leave the kids early in the morning without breakfast so I can work,\u201d she said, asking to be identified only by her nickname, Arabic for \u201cOmar\u2019s mother.\u201d She fears reprisals because of heightened hostilities against Syrians. The shrinking U.N. aid they receive does not pay the bills. Her husband, who shares her fears for their safety, used to work as a day laborer but has rarely left their home in weeks. She says deportation to Syria, where President Bashar Assad\u2019s government is firmly entrenched, would spell doom for her family. \u201cIf my husband was returned to Syria, he\u2019ll either go to jail or (face) forced conscription,\u201d she explains. Still, many in Lebanon tell her family, \u201cyou took our livelihoods,\u201d Um Omar said. There are also those who tell them they should leave, she added, so that the Lebanese \u201cwill finally catch a break.\u201d ___ Albam reported from Harbnoush, Syria.", "summary": "Living in a tent in rebel-held northwestern Syria, Rudaina al-Salim and her family struggle to find enough water for drinking and other basic needs such as cooking and washing.

Clear and accurate.", "body": "* Released five months before his full sentence after being pardoned due to his good behaviour\n\n* He became one of Dadaz Chess Academy volunteers teaching chess to street children and prisoners\n\n* He has found himself in Pune, India where he is sharing his chess story to participants from all over the world\n\nBy Duncan Mlanjira\n\nSteven Maruwo was introduced to chess while at Mvula Prison serving a five-year sentence for being found in possession with the protected animal specie, the pangolin, but today he has found himself in Pune, India where he is sharing his chess story to participants from all over the world.\n\nThat's the kind of influence that former Chess Association of Malawi (CHESSAM) president Susan Namangale is imparting in the minds of prison inmates -- that the spell behind the high walls of the penitentiaries are meant to rehabilitate those found in conflict with the law to contribute positively once released into the society they offended.\n\nNamangale, who is now Zone 4.5 president and founder of Dadaz Chess Academy, introduced chess at Maula Prison some five years ago in partnership with Caswel Mkanda through his Uthunthu Ministry -- a programme that has successfully inculcated chess-playing culture amongst prison inmates using the sport for mindset change for them to become useful citizens once liberated into the society.\n\nNamangale, through Dadaz was inspired to expand the prison outreach at Maula and other penitentiaries after she attended Chess for Freedom conference in Chicago, USA and through her experience when she visited Cook County Sheriff -- USA's second largest prison.\n\nChess in Prison is a tool to improve the quality of life for inmates as they prepare for liberation and Namangale also facilitated that Malawi inmates participate in international online chess games.\n\nWith support of her team of volunteers, Dadaz spread the programme to 16 other prisons to use chess as a tool for reformation and give inmates a meaningful game that they can use to make good decisions for life in and outside the prison walls.\n\nThe prison authorities fully supported the chess program such that in 2023 they allowed that Namangale should register two teams for the intercontinental chess championship -- which was amazingly done as Maula Prison reached the quarterfinals.\n\nThe team's participation was supported by prison patron Kaziputa Jnr and world chess governing body accredited FIDE International Arbiter Gilton Mkumbwa, whose captain was Steven Maruwo.\n\nNamangale reports that Maruwo was released in January this year, five months before his full sentence after being pardoned due to his good behaviour while in prison.\n\n\"Maruwo was very determined with chess through leading the prison club and when he got released he reached out to me and I made him one of my volunteers and started teaching chess to street children and prisoners.\n\n\"I was invited to attend a chess for freedom conference in India and I was asked to bring with me an ex-inmate who can share his chess story in and outside prison and so I chose Steven.\n\n\"This is how Steven and I have found ourselves here in Pune [where he] will be sharing his chess story to participants from all over the world. I will also be representing The Gift of Chess in presenting how I managed to break the prison walls with chess.\n\n\"This is what we mean when we say that chess can change lives as it changed mine and now changing Steven's,\" she said from Pune where the two visited a prison to play chess with inmates and they will also be hosted for a gala dinner awards ceremony.\n\nThe report was shared on her Facebook page, and in his reaction, former chess national championships star player, Stanley Mpinganjira applauded Namangale, saying: \"Whatever you touch, changes into gold -- you really are something else, Susan Namangale.\"\n\nInkosi McWilliams described the life-changing experiences of Maruwo as \"absolutely beautiful\", adding: \"The game of chess is so impactful\" while Jerry Ben Sakala congratulated Maruwo \"for keeping his head high and finding an occupation in chess. And thanks Dadaz for impacting lives positively with chess.\"\n\nClive Bota said of Namangale: \"I always appreciate your great efforts to the game -- breaking barriers; for the love of the game\", while Bright Chikaonda said: \"Wow! This is indeed breaking the prison walls with the chessboard.\"\n\nThe kind words kept pouring in applauding Namangale and Dadaz Academy for changing lives that includes inculcating the chess-playing culture amongst street children.\n\nIn May, Dadaz Academy, in partnership with King Hunters Chess Club opened a new shelter in Lilongwe for the Chess for Street Kids project aimed at providing a safe place for street children to learn and play chess.\n\nOn its Facebook page post on May 25, Dadaz Academy said \"the project goes beyond just teaching chess -- it aims to help street children develop important skills like thinking, planning, and discipline, which can improve their lives and futures\".\n\n\"The new shelter offers a stable environment where the children can focus on their chess lessons. It also serves as a community centre where they receive guidance and support from members of the King Hunters Chess Club.\"\n\nDadaz added that the initiative is also made possible by the chess sets donated by US chess charity, The Gift of Chess, ensuring that all kids have the equipment they need to learn and play.\n\n\"Lilongwe City Council supports this project, recognizing its potential to help the community,\" said the report. \"By providing street kids with a safe space and meaningful activities, the project helps reduce the number of children on the streets and promotes a safer city.\n\n\"This is the first project of its kind in Malawi, marking a significant milestone in providing support and opportunities for street children through chess.\n\nWe invite everyone to support this important cause. Your donations will help sustain the program and provide meals for the children.\"\n\nWhilst in the US for the Chess for Freedom conference, Namangale got connected with Russell Makofsky, founder of The Gift of Chess -- a global sports charity that is transforming lives through its universal language of chess -- that saw Dadaz Academy being appointed as its ambassador.", "source": {"uri": "maraviexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "maraviexpress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_children", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Street children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbiter (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chess engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIDE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chess set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilongwe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lilongwe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lilongwe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "wgt": 68}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://www.maraviexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-maravi-logo-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667028", "eventUri": "eng-9667028", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 4782, "textEnd": 4788}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Her lessons go beyond simply providing chess advice and aim to help her students improve in all aspects of their lives (but the Elo boost is nice, of course). Learn all about WGM Gevorgyan here, from her early chess beginnings to how she became a national champion and earned her title... with an illegal move along the way!\n\nAt what age were you introduced to chess, and who introduced you?\n\nMy grandfather introduced me to chess when I was three years old. Of course, I didn't follow all the rules, but I enjoyed playing. I was a very active kid, but when I had to sit down and play chess, that was my calm moment.\n\nDuring wintertime, I had this chess puzzle book, and since I couldn't play outside, I was solving puzzles from it on my own and forcing all our guests to play chess with me. I was seven-and-a-half years old when I forced my family to take me to chess classes. I was eight when I qualified for the Armenian women's first league.\n\nIt's a funny story. One of the players there said, \"Please take the kid off the stage. We are starting the games!\" I even managed to win one game in that tournament. That was really the beginning of my chess career.\n\nI have many special memories from chess, good ones and bad ones, but there is one story that I will remember forever.\n\nI was playing in the 2019 European Women's Chess Championship, and my opponent was IM Daulyte Deimante. At some point in the game, I castled long; we played for around 5.5 hours and were the last ones playing in the tournament. I won the game and returned to my room.\n\nMy friend came to dinner and I asked to quickly save the game in ChessBase before we went. When I got to the moment of the long castle, ChessBase whistles. I try again... it whistles again and doesn't allow me to play the move! I try it for a third time, it whistles again... I turned to my friend and started laughing very hard as I understood what happened.\n\nI have many special memories from chess, good ones and bad ones, but there is one story that I will remember forever...\n\n-- WGM Maria Gevorgyan\n\nEarlier in the game, I played Ra1-b1, then played back Rb1-a1, and then castled, so my castle was illegal. I texted my opponent apologizing as I didn't do it intentionally. I called my coach at that time, GM Avetik Grigoryan, to tell him what happened. He started laughing even harder and joked that I shouldn't tell anyone!\n\nIt was too late... On the way to the dinner, people started approaching me, asking what had happened. I was out of social media at that time, so I didn't see what was happening there, but apparently, people already saw it! There were videos where some were saying, \"When you just learn how to play chess and don't know the castling rules,\" and some were mentioning the Kasparov-Dreev game (1994) where an illegal castle happened, and they continued playing without noticing, like in my game.\n\nAlso, if the game was stopped and it was mentioned that an illegal move had been played, I would have had to go back -- and as I touched my king, I would have to play with my king, and it was a checkmate in one move!\n\nIn that tournament, I received my third WGM norm and got my WGM title.\n\nWhich coaches were helpful to you in your chess career, and what was the most useful knowledge they imparted to you?\n\nI trained with several Armenian coaches. I would say that five of them had a very big impact on my chess career.\n\nGM Arsen Yeghiazaryan had a big impact on my playing style, and I received most of the knowledge I have from him. I won a medal in the European Youth Championship with him.\n\nWhen I was making a choice for myself whether to continue playing chess or not (as I got a scholarship in the USA to move there and start a career as a diplomat), GM Hrair Simonian appeared in my life. We were training chess for hours, sometimes we would train until 3 a.m. at my house. He taught me mainly practical tricks, opening lines, and so on. He helped me to win the Armenian Women's Championship.\n\nI worked with GM Avetik Grigoryan for a short time but I think I learned training discipline and, after so many years of playing chess, I learned how to work on openings from him. Also, as I'm a chess coach now, he is the main example for me as a coach.\n\nWhen I was making a choice for myself to continue playing chess or not, GM Hrair Simonian appeared in my life ... He helped me to win the Armenian Women's Championship.\n\n-- WGM Maria Gevorgyan\n\nGM Zaven Andriasian supported me throughout my chess career and believed in me. He is an example of a hard-working chess player and, of course, a great chess coach. While being an extremely talented and successful chess player, he became a chess coach at a young age and devoted himself to it.\n\nMy last and current chess coach is FM Hovik Khalikian, the greatest example of the fact that you don't need to be a very good chess player to be a good chess coach! The funny part about us working together is that we almost don't work on chess. He always knows what to say, and what to play. I think it's just wonderful.\n\nWhat is your favorite or the best game you ever played?\n\nWell, this is a hard choice. I have many favorite games. But for me, these are two very beautiful games with some tactics and sacrifices.\n\nHow would you describe your approach to chess coaching?\n\nEven in group classes, I try to show an individual approach to each student. Everyone has their playing style and comfort zone in the chess game. I try to work on the things that are out of their comfort zone because I believe that's exactly what makes them grow in chess. We set short-term and long-term goals. Consistency is the key. I direct them, but they need to understand that many things depend on them and what they do in private.\n\nMy responsibility as a coach is, first of all, to help them unlock their full potential, not only in chess but also in life. Some students become good chess players, some don't, but it's very important for me that they get the maximum out of chess.\n\nI try to explain to them the importance of discipline, nutrition, good sleep... And that hard work always pays off. Currently, I am a full-time chess coach at the Abu Dhabi Chess Club; my students are mostly girls, and it's very important to make them love the game. When they love it, then it won't feel like working, but a joy.\n\nMy priority during training and tournaments is to see them happy and in a good mood. Especially when working with the girls, I understand very well that many things depend on their mood. But nothing is possible unless they want to invest their time, follow the rules of discipline, and work on chess in their own private time.\n\nFirst of all, analyze your played games without the help of the engine. Try to go as deep in the lines as possible, otherwise playing a tournament and not doing this is a waste of such good material and work.\n\nI also try to tell my students to create problems for the opponent on each move. Even in lost positions, you never know what it will lead to, and it's not easy for human beings to solve problem after problem.\n\nI like to show the Leko-Adams game from the 2002 Candidates Tournament. It's a very technical game and includes many small elements for learning:\n\nWhat do you consider the most valuable training tool that the internet provides?\n\nI use Chess.com's classroom a lot. It is amazing that everyone can move the pieces if the coach allows it. The arrows, specifically, are my favorite tool. It's very easy to download the game after finishing it. Chess.com's classroom is truly my favorite place to work on chess.\n\nWhat is the puzzle you give students that tells you the most about how they think?\n\nI like to give this position from the Topalov-Shirov game. As kids, we are told that one shouldn't put a piece under attack by a pawn. And this is one of the limitations we receive as a child. Sometimes, we don't even consider moves like putting a piece under the attack of the pawn or another piece. Occasionally, some players think outside the box and actually go deep into the position, trying to understand the ideas and find a solution that is hidden in everything that we were told not to do.\n\nWhich under-appreciated chess book should every chess player read?\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had a big book library at home. I don't know why, but we also had chess books there, even though no one was reading them.\n\nI remember taking a green book in the Armenian language, Tigran Petrosyan by Gagik Hakobyan. It was such a joy just reading it and solving the diagrams in it. I am pretty sure the examples can be found in other books, too, but that book, in particular, was my favorite.\n\nTo book a lesson with WGM Maria Gevorgyan, contact her via her Chess.com profile!", "source": {"uri": "chess.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chess.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Gevorgyan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maria Gevorgyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Castling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_titles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIDE titles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChessBase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChessBase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Individual_Chess_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Individual Chess Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_puzzle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chess puzzle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elo rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaven_Andriasian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zaven Andriasian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norm (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Checkmate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chess.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Candidates Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armenian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pawn (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Petrosian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tigran Petrosian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "wgt": 73}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/article/30977.eb25740d.5000x5000o.3aca6e3a9a79.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667028", "eventUri": "eng-9667028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

It was organised by the International Chess Federation (FIDE) in partnership with IndianOil. Officials from both the organisations visited Yerwada Central Prison and interacted with inmates and also engaged in a friendly game of chess with the prison's chess team. Trained under IndianOil's 'Parivartan-Prison to Pride' initiative, Pune's team had won the gold medal for India in the third Intercontinental Online Chess Championship for Prisoners.\n\nIt was the prison's men's team which bagged the medal last year. However, chess wasn't introduced for women inmates until two months ago. \"We are captive here and there is so much tension in the prison. Every minute feels like an hour, one day feels like one year. There are lakhs and crores of thoughts that make home in our mind. Thinking about my family, court cases and other worries would take up my mind space completely. But then out of the blue chess coaching started for us. It has only been two months, but I already feel confident that I can play. Earlier, I didn't know anything about the game, just knew that some game of this name existed. But I didn't think I would get to play it one day\", said a female inmate.\n\nChess training has been started for some ten female inmates in the prison. They spend their day farming and then training in chess for a few hours before 4 pm. In Wednesday's friendly game with international delegates, a few women prisoners beat the delegates and were elated about that. After the game, their conversations revolved around who used which technique and what they could have done differently.\n\n\"Whenever someone thinks of prison, it's a negative picture in their mind. But today with this set up and so many visitors, it feels so positive here. I am feeling so happy, especially after playing with the grandmasters\", said another female inmate.\n\nRashmi Govil, Director (HR), IndianOil, Mikhail Korenman, Social Commission Councillor, FIDE, Andre Voegtlin, Social Commissioner Chair, FIDE, Amitabh Gupta IPS, Additional Director General of Police of Prison and Correctional Services, senior officials from Prison department and IndianOil were present on the occasion.\n\nRepresentatives from the jail authorities of other countries also joined the dignitaries.\n\nA female inmate talking about her experience of chess training said, \"There are many other classes, but I liked chess the most. It helps my mind stay fresh. When I focus fully on chess, I can distract myself from worries, so it has helped me sleep\".\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, Sergejs Klimakovs, who fosters the chess classes in Latvia's chess in prison programme said, \"From what I hear, in India they practise five days a week, four hours in each session. So it is very telling as to why it's so tough to fight against India\". Klimakovs, who played a game with a male inmate from Yerwada on Wednesday said, \"It was an equal fight.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ravina_warkad@indianexpress.com", "name": "Ravina Warkad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Oil_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Oil Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIDE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Checkmate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_director_general_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Additional director general of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/chess-yerawada-arul.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667028", "eventUri": "eng-9667028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Wall Street banks took to the chessboard over the past few days to decide who is the brightest.\n\nTurns out, none of them.\n\nBankers and traders from companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG were beaten by players from online chess platforms Chessify and Chessmood in the final rounds of the World Corporate Chess Championship in New York.\n\nUBS Group AG and Susquehanna International Group were the only two financial firms that made it through to the semifinals. In an intense final on Monday afternoon, Chessify clinched the title in three rounds.\n\nThe competition, run by FIDE, the International Chess Federation, crowns the \"smartest company in the world\" through the sport of chess.\n\nTwelve four-person teams - eight of which fought through qualifying rounds in March and April and four wild cards that were invited to play - tested their intellectual prowess through rapid-round chess games held in the Financial District's historic Cunard Building. It was the first time the tournament was held in person, after debuting virtually during the pandemic.\n\nThe event featured at least one notable side match. World-ranked chess player Boaz Weinstein, a hedge fund manager and founder of Saba Capital Management, played to a draw and then lost against Woman Grandmaster Keti Tsatsalashvili of Georgia, he wrote in a post on X.\n\nDuring the tournament, players were penned in by velvet ropes on three sides as spectators circled the perimeter commenting on the game play in whispers. The onlookers ranged from retirees interested in the sport to college-age chess enthusiasts who have been playing since childhood. Some were recent newcomers to the game after being inspired by the hit Netflix TV show Queen's Gambit.\n\nThe rapid-fire format meant the rounds weren't \"long enough for you to have that much training\" and being well-rested was a priority, said Alice Dong, a product manager at BlackRock.\n\nMost teams included high-ranking players with impressive records, such as BlackRock's chess club founder and FX trader Rusa Goletiani. Chessify, ChessMood and Susquehanna each had at least one grandmaster on their teams.\n\n\"We knew coming into this we were a bit outgunned,\" said Alexander Krol, managing director and head of derivatives alpha at BlackRock. \"We came for the experience.\"\n\nTo prepare, William Graif, an associate engineer at Deutsche Bank, studied his opponents' past games. He played his first rated tournament when he was about 5 years old and from then on, he said, chess has always been a \"part of my life.\"\n\n\"When I was little and mostly throughout my childhood, I wanted to compete,\" Graif said. \"I wanted to be the best.\"\n\nChess competitions have taken him to Turkey, Vietnam, Hungary and Portugal. While he still has a competitive spirit for chess, he now focuses more on \"enriching other people's lives through the game of chess\" and has taught at summer chess camps for kids.\n\nOver the 10 rounds played across the weekend, teams typically won or lost all four of their matches. In the two rounds Susquehanna faced off against Goldman, the investment bank lost each time except when Len Ioffe, a managing director, played to a draw against Nan Zhao, a quantitative researcher at Susquehanna.\n\nThe winning team from Chessify included two grandmasters, Zaven Andriasian and Gevorg Harutjunyan, along with Tigran R. Sargsyan and Ani Harutyunyan.\n\nThe tournament experience helped draw players in the companies closer. Igor Shneider, vice president of the Financial Institutions Group at Deutsche Bank, said his team had \"really good camaraderie.\" He started playing chess around age 9 and was ranked as high as 80th in the US in his youth. Shneider has played in Spain, Greece and China, and earned a chess scholarship to the University of Texas, Dallas.\n\nShneider was locked in a \"time scramble\" in a match against a ChessMood team member.\n\n\"I was attacking throughout the game; my opponent conducted a counterattack\" that ultimately left them with less than 30 seconds on the clock each. The time pressure, Shneider said, meant he \"missed some good chances to win the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors":

He highlighted that chessboxing was a particularly memorable experience because of its unique combination of physical and mental challenges.\n\nAs a chess teacher, Rozman stressed the importance of adapting teaching methods to the audience. He noted that while children are often highly motivated to learn, adults can be more difficult due to self-esteem and fear of failure. Sharing insights from his own teaching experience, Rozman emphasized the need to balance instruction with interactive activities to keep students interested.\n\nLink\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game complexity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_titles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIDE titles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chess boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://en.chessbase.com/thumb/119275_l200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667028", "eventUri": "eng-9667028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Seigel wrote that, for the French sculptor and painter, \"the absence of habit was an important condition of freedom.\" Indeed, Duchamp kept no routine and lived an irregular lifestyle in which no two days looked alike. He quit making art on several occasions, throwing his ceiling-suspended hat rack in the ring indefinitely in 1923.\n\nThe only consistency in his life came from his lifelong hobby: chess. Duchamp was introduced to the game by his brothers Raymond and Jacques in 1900, when he was 13 years old. As a professional artist, he held weekly chess nights at the home of his patrons, Louise and Walter Conrad Arensberg, and was apparently so obsessed with the game that, while on honeymoon, his first wife Lydie glued the pieces to his board. They divorced months later.\n\nDuchamp's love of chess was as multifaceted as his art. First and foremost, the quiet game offered moments of reprieve from the noisy, chaotic streets of Upper Manhattan where he lived. On a more cerebral level, he saw chess as form of creative expression. \"The chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts,\" he once remarked, \"and these thoughts, although making a visual design on the chessboard, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem.\"\n\nAccording to a New York Times review of the Francis M. Naumann Fine Arts show \"Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Chess\", written by Holland Cotter, Duchamp saw his profession and his hobby as \"complementary, an ideal intersection of brainpower and beauty. Chess was art; art was chess. Everything was about making the right moves.\"\n\nDuchamp had a tendency of turning ordinary chess games into performance pieces, as provocative as his readymade signed urinals and mounted bike wheels. He frequently held live chess games in the garden of the Connecticut home of fellow artist Katherine Dreier, their friends dressing up in costume to assume the roles of queens and bishops.\n\nIn 1963, Duchamp played chess against a nude Eve Babitz. The up-and-coming writer and socialite, came up with the idea after getting into a fight with her lover, gallerist Walter Hopps, who refused to invite her to the opening night of one of Duchamp's shows because his wife was going to be there.\n\nFive years later, in 1968, Duchamp played against composer John Cage, a fellow connoisseur of quietness, whose controversial 1952 composition \"4'33,\" consisted of 4 minutes and 33 seconds of utter silence. Cage brought a custom-made chessboard where each move produced a different sound and image, turning their match into a musical performance. Unfortunately for the audience, Duchamp was vastly superior to Cage, checkmating the musician in a manner of minutes.\n\nBack in 1918, Duchamp had produced a hand-carved chess set while on sabbatical in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This set, as wood carver and Duchamp aficionado Dan Weber rightly observed on his blog. \"All of that gamesmanship,\" Weber wrote, \"falls away with his handsome, carved wooden chess set, free of any kind of obfuscation, humor, or oppositional critique. It's just... a chess set.\"\n\nPerhaps because of this absence of gamesmanship, it is one of Duchamp's least-known works. It briefly made headlines in 2014, when two artists named Scott Kildall and Bryan Cera made digital copies of the chess pieces available online for 3D printing as part of a project called \"Readymake: Duchamp Chess Pieces,\" which was quickly shut down by Duchamp's estate on grounds of copyright infringement.\n\nAlthough Duchamp began his gradual retreat from the art world as early as 1918, taking further steps in 1923, he never stopped playing chess. In old age, he founded the Marcel Duchamp Chess Endowment Fund in support of American chess, and in 1967 -- a year before his death -- participated in a tournament in Monte Carlo.", "source": {"uri":

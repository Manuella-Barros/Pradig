Charly Boy took to his X and Instagram accounts on Monday to caution Nigerians about Soyinka\u2019s statements and actions, suggesting that the ageing scholar might be experiencing \u2018brain deterioration\u2019. In his post, Charly Boy expressed concerns about the influence of Soyinka\u2019s age on his recent rhetoric and behaviours, hinting at possible deteriorating brain health. He highlighted the need for vigilance among Nigerians to prevent opportunistic politicians from exploiting Soyinka\u2019s medical condition for political gain. \u201cProf. Wole Soyinka is aged over 80yrs even tending towards 90yrs. For his age, some level of brain deterioration is not unexpected. His rhetorics and actions in recent times are suggestive of deteriorating brain disease, and as such he shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously,\u201d Charly Boy wrote. The veteran activist also underscored the failure of Soyinka\u2019s family and close associates to shield him from political manipulation, calling on concerned citizens to remain vigilant. However, Charly Boy\u2019s remarks have drawn sharp criticisms from netizens, who found his comments insulting and unwarranted. On Instagram, users voiced their discontent. A social media user, #Phorlarjuwon, questioned Charly Boy\u2019s own contributions to the nation\u2019s development. \u201cAs a lost man that you are, I think you can do better man than this\u2026As a manwoman, what have you personally contributed to the betterment of the nation? I guess nothing. I didn\u2019t think you have affected this nation in any positive way,\u201d #Phorlarjuwon commented. Another user, #Vesterz011, hinted at the possibility of Charly Boy facing similar criticism in the future, stating, \u201cI hope when you get to that age, you actually handle this kind of message, Bcus its definitely coming back.\u201d Responding to the backlash, #Quakes9ja, tweeting anonymously as Kweku Elenitoba-Johnson, urged critics to address Charly Boy\u2019s claims before resorting to insults. \u201cAddress the man\u2019s claims first before you rain abuse on him,\u201d the tweet read. Meanwhile, some followers called for a more diplomatic approach to handling sensitive issues, emphasising the importance of constructive dialogue over social media attacks. \u201cI think you could have made your point without insults, people look up to you. I believe we can de-escalate a volatile situation if we really want to keep our eyes on the ball,\u201d one follower remarked.", "summary": "Renowned singer and social activist, Charles Oputa, popularly known as Charly Boy, has sparked controversy with his recent remarks questioning the mental well-being of Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka.

{"id": 223754660, "title": "Patrick Freyne\u2019s Irish festivalgoer guide: 11 kinds of peole and things to avoid", "text": "Punters facing away from the stage, taking selfies One perspective: For some time we have known humankind is not at the centre of the cosmos but lives, in fact, on an outlying spiral arm of just one galaxy in an infinite universe. Cosmologically speaking, we live in Donegal. Counterpoint: I am the centre of the universe and Kylie Minogue is but a backdrop to my adventures. The acts Jiggy-Wiggy and the Prunes, Count Bopula Greeves, Funk Cassidy and the Ripe Smell, Wibble, The Trippy Capybara, $&%?!, Pope Pius II, Ikea Shelving Unit 100 x 136cm, Flump, Armadillo Delicious, Loose Goose and the Goslings, Bryan Gosling, Small Simon*. Who even are these people? What has it come to that a confused man in his middle years doesn\u2019t recognise the acts playing at a music festival largely designed for young people? It\u2019s not right. All festivals should be headlined by The Beatles, the Count Basie Orchestra and Sooty and Sweep. (*Not actual bands but possibly accidentally actual bands) [ 63 Irish festivals to head for this summer, from music and comedy to literature and science ] Babies wearing ear protectors silently judging me Babies think they\u2019re so great with their adaptable brains and poor sense of object permanence, and now they go to festivals where they are propelled along in party chariots by fully grown retainers, sullenly observing and judging their elders. You can\u2019t judge me, babies! I was at the Saw Doctors\u2019 New Year\u2019s Eve concert in 1992! Old musos complaining \u201cFinding music is too easy now. Kids don\u2019t know they\u2019re born with their Spotify and their TikTok and their big festival acts. In my day if you really cared about finding new music you\u2019d hitch a lift to a tiny music shop in Carlow where a guy with six fingers on his left hand would take you out back to a corrugated shed and stop your heart for a few minutes. There, while caught between life and death, you would see a vision of Jesus/Buddha/Moses and He would hand you a fifth-generation blank tape of rare Prefab Sprout B-sides. It was brilliant. It was mainly tape hiss.\u201d \u201cWho are Prefab Sprout?\u201d (Old muso collapses into a weeping heap on the ground.) Bad drugs \u201cDon\u2019t take the brown acid.\u201d This was good advice when it was given at Woodstock in 1969, and it\u2019s good advice now. The other colours of acid? We have no information on that at this time. Presumably it\u2019s fine. Have at it. There is no roof Look up. There is no roof! Aaaagh! It\u2019s all sky and clouds and the terrors of the cosmos. Nothing is stopping any one of us from flying off this swiftly spinning orb \u2013 nothing but the whims of gravity and the fact that I\u2019ve tied myself to this tree. The food In the olden days, the only food option at festivals was a half-frozen burger and soggy chips slung at you by a man with a cigarette hanging from his bottom lip. The chip vans had names like Eat This, You Pigs and We Hate You. That changed, and soon there was a selection of delicious food from all over the world at every festival, and the vans had names like Elysium and Your Father Loved You, Actually. This was wonderful for a while, but soon we were jaded. Yes, we have all eaten of the finest noodles, pies and birianis, but are we sated? We are not. We crave more. A whisper goes around from one gourmand to another of another meal, a forbidden meal, the most delicious of all: \u201cYou do not mean ... no ... not ...\u201d \u201cYes, I speak of ... Man! (There\u2019s a van doing it in the artists\u2019 area.)\u201d \u201cOkay, but just a small portion. I\u2019ve already had chips.\u201d Stupid nature just hanging out being lovely Don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s pleasant to be out in the countryside observing the world\u2019s treasury \u2013 the trees, the grass, the birds of the air and cows of the earth \u2013 but it\u2019s also important to bombard it all with unearthly speaker systems, flashing lights and lots of plastic and aluminium, so it knows its place in the food chain (our bellies). Ha! Take that, Nature. My favourite bit of every festival is when everyone stands up as one and says, in unison, \u201cI am God\u2019s supreme creation and have dominion over Earth.\u201d The evening horde At a certain point in the evening the horde arrives. They have been drinking cans all day at the campsite, and now it\u2019s time to enter the festival, where they will rampage, having \u201cfun\u201d. \u201cYou no-good kids!\u201d you shout, shaking your fist. \u201cYou need to take things seriously, fly straight and study for your exams or ChatGPT will take your jobs!\u201d \u201cRaaagh!\u201d say the horde. \u2018Steve\u2019 \u201cGet out of my tent, please, Steve. No, I don\u2019t work for the CIA, I know your name because your friends have written it in marker on your forehead. Yes, I realise that you\u2019re sleepy, but this is my tent and I\u2019ve never met you before. That does sound difficult, Steve, but Vietnam happened a long time ago, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re old enough to have fought in it. Steve? Are you wearing my clothes? Steve?!? Steve!! Wake up, Steve!!\u201d Middle-aged people Deep in the centre of many festivals is an arts area where middle-aged people listen to poetry and hear intellectuals discuss the issues of the day on live podcasts. Nobody knows where this area came from, but it is believed that it was here first and the festival accreted around it. The artists, podcasters and broadcasters in this area are insulated from the barbarity of the wider festival, much like the Eternals in John Boorman\u2019s Zardoz. But from time to time one of them wanders in horror through the drunken wasteland beyond and writes a newspaper article about the youth of today, and then we all have to deal with that for a while.", "summary": "If you\u2019re heading for Electric Picnic, All Together Now or Beyond the Pale this summer, beware", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2024/05/26/patrick-freynes-irish-festivalgoer-guide-11-kinds-of-peole-and-things-to-avoid/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/qAswBltxTJumQnfk1o1QjZUR0us=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/AS6MQMN2MZFSJAZD3UT7YOO4U4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:14:39", "author": "Patrick Freyne", "authors": ["Patrick Freyne"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.197}

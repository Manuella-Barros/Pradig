She hasn't been heard or seen from since Feb. 2 -- the day that an unknown person spraypainted the outside security cameras at the apartment building where she was staying in Madrid, according to a conservatorship petition filed last month in Broward County court by her family. A friend of Ana Knezevic Sanna Rameau, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel earlier this year that a man wearing a helmet was seen spray-painting the security cameras.\n\nHer friends received suspicious text messages from Ana Knezevich's phone on Feb. 3 that they do not believe were written by her, the South Florida Sun Sentinel previously reported. The messages said she had met a man and was going to stay with him for a few days.\n\nOne of Ana Knezevich's friends filed a police report on Feb. 5 with the National Police in Madrid \"due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding Ms. Knezevich's disappearance,\" according to the conservatorship petition.

after arriving...", "body": "The estranged husband of a Florida woman who vanished in Spain in the middle of their divorce has been arrested at a Miami airport after arriving back home from Serbia, according to authorities.\n\nDavid Knezevich, 35, was arrested Saturday at Miami International Airport in connection to the disappearance of his wife of 13 years, Ana Knezevich, 40, who vanished on Feb. 2, Spanish news outlet EFE reports.\n\nHe flew in from Belgrade in his native Serbia, where he had been living for the last few months while denying any involvement in the disappearance of his estranged wife, whom he had lived with in Miami.\n\nKnezevich was arrested as part of the ongoing muli-national investigation led by the FBI in Florida and involving police in Spain and Colombia as well as the Belgrade Interior Attache Office, the report said.\n\nAna, a Colombian-American citizen, had moved to Spain in December to clear her mind while going through a \"difficult divorce\" with Knezevich, it was previously revealed.\n\nShe rented an apartment in Madrid and stayed close to her friends before she suddenly disappeared.\n\nHer friend Sanna Rameau told WSVN she failed to connect with Ana on the day she vanished, with Rameau receiving a message the following day about a strange meet up Ana allegedly had.\n\nThe message claimed Ana met a man and that they had a unique \"connection\" almost instantly, with Ana opting to travel with him to a country home with spotty cell service.\n\nAna's family had also received the message in Spanish and told police that they not only believe the message wasn't sent from her, they think it wasn't even sent from a native Spanish speaker.\n\nRameau told the Daily Mail that Ana had recently been using the Bumble dating app and police have interviewed men she chatted with from the site.\n\nOfficers also found surveillance footage from Ana's building showing a man in a black helmet spraying paint over two security cameras.\n\nKnezevich has maintained that he played no role in Ana's disappearance, with his attorney, Ken Padowtiz, speaking with NewsNation's Chris Cuomo claiming the couple's split was amicable.\n\nThe claim contradicts that of Joaquin Amills, the president of the SOS Missing Persons Association, who said in a statement that the divorce proceedings were so difficult that Ana was \"asking for medical help for depression.\"\n\nPadowtiz also defended his client's refusal to fly to Spain to help in the investigation, claiming Knezevich would be of no use since he doesn't speak Spanish.\n\nKnezevich has also previously refused to take a lie detector test, which under Florida law serves as admissible evidence in criminal investigations.\n\nPadowtiz could not immediately be reached for comment over Knezevich's arrest.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia",

Knezevich had been from the outset the prime suspect in the investigation, as the couple were going through a difficult separation involving a dispute over the multimillionaire patrimony they managed. Knezevich is of Serbian origin and Ana Mar\u00eda is a U.S. citizen born in Colombia. They both lived in Miami, where their businesses were based, until she decided to move to Madrid at the end of 2023 to get away from her husband.\n\nThe Spanish National Police reported the arrest, which took place Saturday in an operation involving the Spanish Interior Ministry's attach\u00e9 office in Belgrade, the FBI, and the Colombian police.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda arrived in late 2023 after enduring several months of a high-conflict divorce in which she had proposed to her husband that they divide their assets equally, a proposal that he did not accept. The couple had been married for 13 years. Ana Mar\u00eda, 40, decided to settle in Spain because she had several friends to help her start from scratch in a new country. On February 2, she spoke with one of these friends about a trip to Barcelona they had planned for the following Monday. That was the last time anyone heard from her.\n\nThe following day, February 3, two other friends received messages from Ana Mar\u00eda, one in English and one in Spanish. However, both quickly realized the messages were not written by her due to the manner of expression and their content. In the text, Ana Mar\u00eda explained that she had met a man unexpectedly and was going to spend the weekend at his house in the countryside outside Madrid.\n\nOn the same day of her disappearance, the security cameras in her residential block in the upmarket Salamanca district of Madrid were disabled with spray. The lock on Ana Mar\u00eda's apartment was not forced and the emergency services found the apartment empty and without any noticeable disorder. Her cell phone was not located in a search of the premises. In the early stages of the investigation, the case was transferred to a court handling instances of gender violence.\n\nFrom the outset, Ana Mar\u00eda's family was suspicious of the answers provided by Knezevich. At first, he did not answer the phone, and later denied knowing anything about her whereabouts, claiming that he was in Serbia at the time of her disappearance. His cooperation with the authorities was always limited and he contracted the services of a criminal lawyer from the United States as soon as the investigation began.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Corps_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Police Corps (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_of_Colombia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Police of Colombia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamanca_(Madrid)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salamanca (Madrid)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salamanca (Madrid)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/CPOVXFVGNND7ZOGWDK27S5MB2I.jpg?auth=4d0ddcdb2b9db748d1eb2c528b4a994b33d985b4bd86e7cf6e87d8430c56f092&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543965", "eventUri": "eng-9543965", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-02", "textStart": 1206, "textEnd": 1216}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-03", "textStart": 1389, "textEnd": 1399}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

They had been married for 13 years when she disappeared in Spain on 2 February.\n\nMr Knezevich was returning from Belgrade, Serbia -- his home country -- where he had been living for several months. He has denied any involvement in the disappearance of his wife. The couple previously lived in Miami.\n\nHe was expected to appear in federal court in Miami on Monday afternoon, according to WSVN.\n\nThe arrest is the latest development in a multi-national investigation spearheaded by the FBI and with the assistance of authorities in Spain, Columbia, and Belgrade, according to Spanish news outlet EFE.\n\nMs Knezevich, who is Columbian-American, reportedly moved to Spain in December amid a divorce with Mr Knezevich that her brother described to detectives as \"nasty.\"\n\nHer friend Sanna Rameau said the day after Ms Knezevich disappeared, she received a text from the missing woman claiming she had met a man and was leaving for some time, WSVN reports.\n\n\"I met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I'll call you when I get back,\" the text read. \"Yesterday after therapy I needed a walk and he approached me on the street! Amazing connection. Like I never had before.\"\n\nThe text was also sent to Ms Knezevich's family members in Spanish. They told police they did not believe the text was from Ms Knezevich, and did not believe the text was sent by a native Spanish speaker.\n\nMs Rameau had reportedly been using the Bumble dating app while in Spain. Local police have conducted interviews with the men she talked to, The Daily Mail reports.\n\nFurther suspicion developed around her disappearance when police discovered surveillance footage at her home showing a man in a black motorcycle helmet spraying over a pair of security cameras on the day of her disappearance.\n\nMr Knezevich has insisted he had no role in her disappearance.\n\nHis attorney, Ken Padowitz, told the Associated Press that reports that the couple's divorce had been trying were overblown and that Mr Knezevich was doing everything he could from Serbia to locate his estranged wife.\n\n\"David has worked with authorities. He has talked to detectives in Spain on a number of occasions. He's provided credit card information ... He obtained a lawyer in Spain to sign documents that might help the Spanish authorities go into the apartment that his wife had rented,\" Padowitz said. \"He is doing everything that he possibly can ... from Serbia.\"\n\nHe further said that Mr Knezevich travelling to Spain would not help investigators.\n\n\"He does not speak Spanish. He does not have family in Spain. He does not have friends in Spain. He does not have a house or an apartment or any place to live in Spain,\" Mr Padowitz said.\n\nJoaquin Amilis, the president of the SOS Missing Persons Association, rejected Mr Padowitz's description of the couple's divorce; he said that the proceedings had been so difficult that Ms Knezevich was \"asking for medical help for depression\", according to the New York Post.\n\nMr Knezevich has previously refused to take a lie detector test, which is admissible as evidence under Florida law.

He also told police he was \"very concerned\" about his sister.\n\n\"He stated that David traveled to Serbia on January 17th of this year but he is unsure how long he stayed there,\" the report states. \"Furthermore, he called and texted David asking him where was Ana to no avail. Juan advised that David replied back to him last night around 6pm via 'Whats [App]' as if he was out of the country telling Juan that Ana was missing and nothing else besides that.\"\n\nDavid left Fort Lauderdale for Serbia, where he is from originally, months before his wife vanished amid their separation. Ana had been spending lots of time in Europe with friends after the couple began discussing divorce.\n\n\"He has no answers as to why this happened, and he feels terrible but definitely wants to speak up when facts are put out there indicating that there was a 'nasty' divorce when no such thing is a fact,\" Padowitz previously told Fox News Digital of news headlines that circulated after Ana's disappearance.\n\nFRIEND OF AMERICAN WOMAN WHO DISAPPEARED IN SPAIN AFTER SENDING STRANGE MESSAGES SPEAKS OUT: 'VERY, VERY STRANGE'\n\nAna and David ran an IT company together in South Florida, and they were also interested in real estate. Rameau previously described them as a \"successful couple\" who had been married for 13 years before they decided to separate last summer, in a phone interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\n\n\"It was difficult for her, obviously, so she started spending more time in Europe, in Madrid, where she has friends from before,\" Rameau said.\n\nThen she disappeared.\n\nRameau got a strange text from Ana on Feb. 3, a day after she suspects her friend was \"taken against her will.\"\n\nFLORIDA WOMAN DISAPPEARS IN MADRID AFTER SUSPICIOUS TEXTS, BLACKED-OUT SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS\n\n\"I met someone wonderful!\" the WhatsApp message reads. \"He has a summer house about 2 [hours] from Madrid.

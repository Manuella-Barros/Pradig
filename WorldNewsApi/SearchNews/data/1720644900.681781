The 62-year-old singer shared a sweet memory of him and his daughter \u2013 who he shares with his ex-wife Tish Cyrus \u2013 on Instagram on June 7. His post included a throwback photo of him and Miley, back when she was a baby, alongside a poem, titled \u201cThe Moment,\u201d that he had written. The post, which was an Instagram video of memories, was also set to Miley\u2019s hit song, \u201cFlowers.\u201d In the caption, Billy Ray recalled when the old photo of him and his daughter was taken. \u201cOne of my best memories ever: @cma Fest, back when it was Fan Fair. That\u2019s @mileycyrus and me, surrounded by thousands of incredible fans at the fairgrounds. The next day, someone handed me this picture, and I wrote that poem right then on the bus,\u201d he wrote. The \u201cWords by Heart\u201d singer went on to gush over Miley and all the success she\u2019s had throughout her career so far. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of her. She\u2019s a survivor and a true artist. She learned early on to love and appreciate the fans who make everything possible,\u201d he continued. Cyrus, who starred alongside his daughter in the hit Disney Channel show Hannah Montana, also shared one of the things he believes that he and Miley have in common. \u201cWe both cherish the connection we have with our fans and are grateful for every single one of you! Hope you all have a great Friday! Now rock the country!!!\u201d he concluded. Billy Ray\u2019s post comes months after fans speculated that Miley snubbed her father when receiving one of her two Grammy Awards earlier this year. When accepting the award for \u201cRecord of the Year\u201d for her song \u201cFlowers,\u201d Miley sweetly mentioned some members of her family, except her father. \u201cI want to thank everyone that\u2019s standing on this stage right now Tom, Tyler, Michael, and Greg,\u201d she said. \u201cOur teams, my team, Crush, Columbia, my mommy, my sister, my love, my main gays because look how good I look.\u201d She then quipped about not missing anyone\u2019s name in her speech, which fans believed was shade towards her father. \u201cI don\u2019t think I forgot anyone,\u201d the \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d singer said. \u201cBut I may have forgotten underwear. Bye!\u201d Following the Grammys, a source also alleged to Us Weekly that Billy Ray had attempted to contact his daughter, and that that the pair didn\u2019t have a close relationship. \u201cHe\u2019s tried reaching out to Miley many times and congratulated her on her Grammys,\u201d the source claimed in February. \u201cMiley and Billy Ray are on the outs. Miley\u2019s very close with her mom and is standing by her.\u201d There\u2019s been previous speculation that there\u2019s been a divide between Tish and Billy Ray\u2019s five children: Brandi, 37, Trace, 35, Miley, 31, Braison, 30, and Noah, 24. Tish has since moved on with Prison Break star Dominic Purcell, who she married in August of last year. Meanwhile, Billy Ray married singer Firerose, 34, in October 2023. Miley served as a bridesmaid at her mother Tish\u2019s wedding last summer, while her older siblings Brandi and Trace Cyrus were also in attendance. However, many fans noticed that her younger siblings Braison and Noah were not present for their mother\u2019s nuptials. The same day as their mother\u2019s wedding, Noah shared photos to her Instagram Story of her and Braison together - clearly not at Tish\u2019s intimate, poolside wedding ceremony in Malibu. Instead, the brother and sister posed for photos in a restaurant as Noah wrote in her Story that Braison \u201cflew out\u201d to see her in Los Angeles. In another Story post, the \u201cJuly\u201d singer also notably wore a T-shirt with her father Billy Ray\u2019s face on it. However, no members of the Cyrus family have addressed rumors of a feud.

The film abandons interesting ideas for more drab scare sequences, lacking balance. Russell Crowe's performance falls short of matching the movie's tone, leading to an empty experience.\n\nYou would not be blamed for being confused about the existence of The Exorcism. The poster shows Russell Crowe donning the collar and holding up a cross, so it's a natural assumption to think this is a follow-up to last year's religious horror movie The Pope's Exorcist, in which Crowe starred as the titular priest. Then you watch the trailer and see that it's about the filming of a movie in which a priest must exorcise a demon out of a teenage girl's body. Is this a riff on The Exorcist!? The connection to the 1973 horror game-changer is only reinforced once you learn that The Exorcism is directed by Joshua John Miller, son of Jason Miller who played Father Karras in The Exorcist -- confused yet?\n\nBut no, this movie is an entirely stand-alone venture. Yes, it absolutely winks an eye at The Exorcist and many other '70s horror movies. The presence of producer Kevin Williamson is felt because as what Scream did for the slasher genre, The Exorcism is trying to do for religious horror movies. Emphasis on \"trying.\" The Exorcism has a fun concept that most horror lovers will enjoy, but unlike Scream, it can't find its footing between comedy and horror, and right in the middle is Crowe giving one of his most heavy-handed performances to date.\n\nThe Exorcism (2024) RHorrorThriller\n\nA troubled actor begins to exhibit a disruptive behavior while shooting a horror film. His estranged daughter wonders if he's slipping back into his past addictions or if there's something more sinister at play.\n\nRelease Date June 7, 2024 Director Joshua John Miller , M.A. Fortin Cast Russell Crowe , Ryan Simpkins , Chloe Bailey , Sam Worthington , adam goldberg , David Hyde Pierce Runtime 93 Minutes Writers Joshua John Miller , M.A. Fortin Studio(s) MiraMax , Outerbanks Entertainment Expand What Is 'The Exorcism' About?\n\nCrowe's Anthony Miller (a very on-the-nose nod to the director's father) is an actor past his peak, haunted by the death of his wife which led him to alcoholism and drug addiction, creating a tension-filled relationship with his teenage daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins). Lee has been suspended from school so she is accompanying her father on the set of \"The Georgetown Project\" (which The Exorcism was originally titled and should have stayed as). \"The Georgetown Project\" has the exact same plot as The Exorcist; a troubled priest is asked to save a teenage girl (Chloe Bailey) from the vicious demon that has possessed her. The only reason Anthony gets the part is because, as we see in the opening scene, the original actor died under suspicious circumstances on set.\n\nAs the film's production starts under the direction of Peter (Adam Goldberg having the most fun out of anyone), the role starts to take its toll on Anthony. He has a deep distrust of priests after a traumatic experience from his days as an altar boy, extending to Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce) who has been hired to consult on the film. As The Exorcism mentions, the sets of horror movies like The Omen and The Exorcist were haunted, and it seems \"The Georgetown Project\" is no different. Something has possessed Anthony, and learning his lines becomes the least of his troubles.\n\n'The Exorcism' Has a Fun Concept But Doesn't Execute It Well\n\nAs said before, there is a really fun idea at the center of The Exorcism. There are plenty of meta jokes that feel straight out of a Scream film. When the egotistical and obnoxious Peter is describing his film at the pre-production party, he tells anyone who can listen that it's a \"psychological drama wrapped in the skin of a horror movie,\" riffing on recent trends of horror movies trying to claim they aren't one. When something is clearly wrong with Anthony that goes beyond what we know of this world, his colleagues dismiss it as him going too method. It's also given a personal touch as Miller is framing Anthony as an extension of his own father and his role in The Exorcist. The first half runs on the steam of this meta-comedy, but it loses all speed when it tries to become a dense, dark, and heavy horror drama. Miller has proven he's a natural with satire and blending horror with comedy as seen in his script for 2015's The Final Girls. But around halfway through The Exorcism, it abandons everything it's been setting up to give way to formulaic and stale scare sequences.\n\nRelated Russell Crowe Faces Literal Demons in New 'The Exorcism' Image\n\nThe supernatural horror film haunts theaters later this month.\n\nThere are glimmers of modern ideas that the movies it references couldn't deal with, such as Anthony's sexual assault at the hands of a Catholic priest when he was a kid. However, it shows him still going to confession and the movie doesn't dive deeper into what it must be like for those devout to their religion who experienced unimaginable evil at the hands of the very people they were told to trust most. The film becomes so hellbent on trying to scare you and make possessed Anthony into a terrifying villain that it forgets about all of the themes and ideas it presents in the first half. Faith and the divide between good and evil are kind of prerequisites for movies like these, but The Exorcism can't be bothered to explore them. You start to realize how seriously this movie takes itself, a stark contrast to the meta-comedy that makes the first act so enthralling.\n\nMiller's direction and scare tactics simply don't match this subgenre of horror. The classic jump scares are created out of loud, obnoxious pangs of the score and the grim, bleak lighting that is meant to create atmosphere just cheapens the entire production, resembling a forgotten 2000s remake. The intensity with which the film tries to scare you doesn't match the somewhat silly idea that the movie is founded on. The atmosphere and overall feel of the film become an attempt at an Ari Aster movie but with none of the rich characters and themes to make it work.\n\n'The Exorcism' Doesn't Match Up to Other Recent Religious Horror Movies Close\n\nAnthony's possession is seemingly meant to mirror Regan's in The Exorcist. Instead of a fresh twist on the \"young girl gets possessed and needs to be saved by an adult,\" it makes for some bizarre and downright uncomfortable moments. Anthony lingers licking on his own daughter's hand as she gives him his meds and when the demon has fully taken over, he makes outrageous sexual comments towards her as well as using homophobic slurs. For a film that is seemingly trying to take a modern approach to '70s horror, moments like this send it all the way back to the dark ages. On top of that, his own daughter has to watch him appear naked, and, in a nod to an early scene in The Exorcist, urinate on himself. It's creepy but for all the wrong reasons. Top this off with an egregious comment from Peter about Anthony's sexual assault, and you have some of the most outrageously callous dialogue in recent horror.\n\nWith so many recent religious horror hits, from Immaculate which sees the horrors of how women are treated within the Catholic Church to The First Omen examining the parallels between the evils of the Church and the entities that it claims to protect us from, The Exorcism feels even more outdated. Like The Exorcist: Believer, there's a grotesque mention of abortion for no reason and there's an unignorable pro-Catholic Church message. Instead of dissecting Anthony's complicated relationship with priests and his faith, it hails Father Conor as the ultimate hero, shedding the film of any nuance in its conversations around faith.\n\nRussell Crowe's Performance in 'The Exorcism' Doesn't Match the Movie's Tone\n\nAs much as this writer detested The Pope's Exorcist, it can't be denied that Russell Crowe was having a lot of fun in that movie -- the image of him riding a moped in full priest getup is a gift in itself. Here, however, his heavy-handed and overly somber performance doesn't go in line with the meta concept of the film. Sure, he's a struggling actor past his prime who has gone through considerable trauma, but Crowe doesn't let us see past those aspects of Anthony. He's defined by his dark past and The Exorcism makes the fatal (and very common mistake) of asking the audience to invest in a character it doesn't bother to fully form. Simpkin's Lee ends up carrying the film to the end, aided by her sweet romance with Bailey's Blake. The film landed two great actors for its supporting roles, Sam Worthington and David Hyde Pierce. For the star of two of the highest-grossing movies of all time, Worthington is given shockingly little to do. Pierce is confident in the role of the good-natured priest, but when his character seems to go against the ideas the film presents, it's hard to separate it from the performance.\n\nThe Exorcism seems to be a capitalization on the recent surge in interest in religious horror movies. Instead of being a remake, requel, or reboot, it set out to do something different while paying tribute to the '70s religious horror greats. It's a commendable idea when the horror genre is inundated with uninspiring retreads of former glory. However, a fun concept does not automatically mean a quality film, as the overly intense direction, hollow scares, and imbalance of tone make it a thrown-together mess.\n\nREVIEW The Exorcism (2024)\n\nThe Exorcism has an interesting idea at its core but ultimately falls victim to its self-seriousness and empty scares.\n\n510\n\nProsThe meta quality of its concept makes for some fun jabs at the horror genre.

Yet the only thing that The Exorcism shares with The Pope's Exorcist (outside of its lead) is the subject matter. Because otherwise, this is a very different film, both in tone and plot.

We got into all things The Exorcism, including the very intense process of writing the script.

You wait years for one, and then two turn up in quick succession. In UK cinemas from 21 June, The Exorcism sees the Gladiator star as Anthony Miller, a troubled actor, who begins to unravel while shooting a supernatural horror film.\n\nIt's not connected with Crowe's previous 2024 release The Pope's Exorcist. In fact, it's an entirely different beast exploring the concept of possession from a new angle, and sees the Oscar-winning star at his menacing best as he falls victim of the dark side, rather than fighting it.\n\nWe're thrilled to share an exclusive clip from the film, which shows Crowe as Anthony alongside Fear Street's Ryan Simpkins as his child Lee Miller, as they come to realise all is not right right with their father. Watch it above.\n\nProduced by Kevin Williamson, the mastermind of the Scream slasher franchise, The Exorcism was written and directed by filmmaker Joshua John Miller, who previously enjoyed huge success with his subversive 2015 horror movie The Final Girls.\n\nLike his previous film, The Exorcism subverts expectations by flipping the dynamics of William Friedkin's seminal adaptation of The Exorcist. Talking about the film's origin, Miller told The AU Review: \"After Trump got elected in America, it just seemed like straight white men were going crazy.\n\n\"We wanted to do an exorcism movie, and we thought let's not have it be a hysterical woman saved by a man.

I think I was because I was pretty young,\" the director explained. \"But the thing was, it was on TV.

Miller and Fortin subvert genre expectations with personal elements in their supernatural horror film. The horror in The Exorcism lies in grief and emotional violence, not just standard scares.\n\nThere's a lot to unpack in The Exorcism, the new film from writer/director Joshua John Miller and co-writer M.A. Fortin, not the least of which is where the movie came from, and what it's trying to achieve. For Miller, the son of the late actor Jason Miller (Father Damien Karras in The Exorcist), he says that in addition to being a love letter to his dad, it's also \"a FU letter to Hollywood a little bit.\"The Exorcism stars Russell Crowe in a meta-tale about a troubled actor unraveling on the set of his new horror film, but one has to wonder if it's his past addictions getting the better of him, or if something supernatural is at work?\n\nSitting down with Fangoria for an in-depth interview ahead of The Exorcism's release on June 21, 2024, Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin discussed not only how the film subverts genre expectations, but how personal it was for both of them, who have been longtime partners in life, and in movies. Miller, who co-wrote the film The Final Girls with Fortin, says that while that movie may have been a love letter to his mother, The Exorcism is a love letter to his father. He also calls The Exorcism \"a FU letter to Hollywood a little bit.\"\n\n\"[We wanted to] subvert the expectations of the genre. But it was definitely also obviously personal. There are personal elements, and I think Final Girls is very much, obviously, a love letter to my mom, and I think The Exorcism was a love letter, obviously to my dad, but also a FU letter to Hollywood a little bit , because we wanted to sort of tell a story that Hollywood men making movies in the studio system or working the studio system is a deal with the devil.\"\n\nThe Exorcism (2024) R Release Date June 7, 2024 Director Joshua John Miller , M.A. Fortin Cast Russell Crowe , Ryan Simpkins , Chloe Bailey , Sam Worthington , Adam Goldberg , David Hyde Pierce Main Genre Horror\n\nThe Exorcism also stars David Hyde Pierce and is produced by Kevin Williamson's Outerbanks Entertainment and Miramax, both of which have a long history with horror, but even still, both Miller and Fortin say they were surprised that Miramax was willing to take a chance on the film considering that the filmmakers don't think of it as your typical horror movie. Miller adds:\n\n\"To me, the horror is in the grief. The horror is in the violence, emotional violence that happens between the daughter and father. The trauma they both share.\"\n\nJoshua John Miller Says People Are Going to Call Him An \"A**hole\" Close\n\nMiller and Fortin also sat down with MovieWeb for our own chat with the two about The Exorcism, which Fortin says was originally titled The Georgetown Project, a reference to the film that Russell Crowe is making in the movie. It wasn't until recently that the title of The Exorcism was adopted, which Miller says comes from a place of nostalgia, something he says is very prominent in today's society.\n\n\"I think the world presently is complicated, obviously, globally, domestically, socially, and I think that there's a huge premium placed on nostalgia...our need to be nostalgic, and reexamine the things from our childhood, or another time, and I think that's part of us grieving the past, and wanting to try and return to it in certain ways because we're sad it no longer exists.\"\n\nRelated The Exorcism's Director Recalls First Seeing His Dad's 'Dangerous Movie'\n\nJoshua John Miller remembers being \"pretty young\" when he watched his father, Jason Miller, in The Exorcist for the first time.\n\nHe would go on to say that if people are expecting The Exorcism (which also stars Chole Bailey) to be like the film his father starred in way back in 1973, they're in for a disappointment. He says that some people will probably even call him an \"a**hole.\"\n\n\"I think there's gonna be people who are going to jump on the rise with us, and then I think people are going to be like, 'You're an a**hole! Why isn't this giving me Exorcism 101 [vibes]?'\"\n\nAudiences can judge for themselves whether The Exorcism lives up to all Miller and Fortin hope it will be when it hits theaters on June 21, 2024.

But without a second idea about how to make that premise fly, there's nowhere for \"The Exorcism\" to go -- beyond having Russell Crowe channel Linda Blair.\n\nYes, it's a slight change to have the devil possess the body of a big, tough-looking guy instead of a delicate, bile-spewing girl, but it's not enough. In the end, the movie must arrive at the same place: in either a successful or failed attempt to evict demons from the host body.\n\nThe fact that \"The Exorcism\" has Crowe in the lead role elevates it a bit, but only in the sense that it takes what could have been a miserable viewing experience and makes it pain-neutral. Crowe plays Tony, a screen actor trying to relaunch his career, having recently let himself go entirely. Following the death of his wife, he plunged headlong into drugs and alcohol, then did a stint in rehab and now he's chastened and wondering if he can still act.\n\nAs is often the case with horror movies, the best parts happen before the horror. As Tony, Crowe has an imposing look and a deep, rumbling voice, and he seems very much at home with himself. He's a formidable presence, but at the same time, he seems to be cloaked in a shame that he doesn't have the energy to conceal.\n\nHis teenage daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins) is living with him, having been suspended from school, and their relationship is nicely delineated by the actors and by director Joshua John Miller. Lee regards her father with a surface contempt hiding a deep well of admiration and affection. She tells herself that he's a hopeless case, but all the same, she hopes that this new movie might elevate his spirits and bolster his sobriety.\n\nAll this you get from the movie's first 15 minutes - two good characters, too good actors and a compelling situation. So it's frustrating to watch all of that intelligent effort soon get funneled into a series of cliches that were already old by the late 1970s.\n\nThe tone of \"The Exorcism\" is deadly serious, but one wonders if the premise might have worked better as a scary comedy rather than as a scary drama. Adam Goldberg, who plays the director, seems at times to want to go full out in the direction of absurdity, but he pulls back his performance just short of that.\n\nThere are some odd notes. For example, the director hates what Tony is doing in the role of the priest, and yet it's hard to see why. Crowe's acting is equally good, whether as Tony or as Tony acting. In both, he's better than the movie deserves.\n\nGradually, \"The Exorcism\" goes to hell in all senses of the phrase. The last hour is everything you'd expect and nothing you wouldn't expect.

For one, Russell Crowe (one of the best actors of all time), who seems to be making a quiet transition into this subgenre of horror, starring here. And two, a compelling story crafted by Miller and M. A. Fortin who penned the highly underrated 2015 film The Final Girls. Unquestionably, there are bright sparks, but the film spins its head too far around by the final act that it forgets where it's at.\n\nActor Anthony \"Tony\" Miller (Crowe) joins the cast of the supernatural horror film The Georgetown Project after the previous actor suffered an on-set \"accident\" that claimed his life. Anyone who is familiar with the behind-the-scenes stories of The Exorcist and Poltergeist will be aware of the superstition associated with these types of films and the mishaps and bad luck that befell many of the people involved in the projects.\n\nThe Exorcism leans into this, with even actor Blake Holloway (Chloe Bailey) spraying sage all around her before going on set and the story creating a familial connection between Tony and actor Jason Miller who played Father Karras in The Exorcist. The film, though, is all about Tony, who not only starts to behave strangely while filming the movie but is also forced to deal with the demons of his past.\n\nThe concept for The Exorcism works better than the overall execution, though. Russell Crowe puts in a powerful performance (as always), ensuring that Tony remains mesmerizing on screen and the audience feels the unraveling nature of his fragile character. However, there's a version of this story that connects the subliminal and explicit better than this. While the filmmakers intentionally lean into the possession tropes as a form of homage, the more interesting parts of the story are Tony's exploration of his own experienced trauma and the ambiguity. One has to wonder if the film might have worked better if they blurred the lines between if he was actually possessed or processing everything that happened to him before. At times, the possession scenes feel too on the nose and generic.\n\nThis leads to the topic of the scares, which prove to be the weakest sauce here. The trailer's cut terrifies far more than the film ever does as it overly relies on predictable jump scares. More disappointingly, the third act generates into cartoonish Buffy the Vampire Slayer territory in terms of it looking and feeling far too goofy to be taken seriously. Part of this is due to David Hyde Pierce's performance as Father Conor. While Pierce is an excellent actor in his own right, he's horribly miscast in this instance. It's tough to tell if he's in a comedy or horror because his approach saddles the line when this shouldn't even be a question.\n\nIronically, as a drama-driven character study, The Exorcism captivates and leaves a mark, largely thanks to Russell Crowe who carries the movie. However, that isn't the path chosen in the end here. Instead, it's a middle-of-the-road horror that occasionally shows signs of what could have been a phenomenal movie. It's disappointing, really, especially considering the immense potential of its premise that doesn't feel like it was fully capitalized on and explored.", "source": {"uri": "fortressofsolitude.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortress of Solitude"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sergio_pereira@fortressofsolitude.co.za", "name": "Sergio Pereira", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

His estranged daughter wonders if he's slipping back into his past addictions or if there's something more sinister at play.\n\nEarly on in The Exorcism, Ryan Simpkins' rebellious teenager Lee says to her father Anthony (some heavy family baggage has put her off from calling him dad, instead referring to him as Tony) that he is all wrong for his comeback acting role as a priest performing an exorcism. The joke here is twofold: the intimidating Russell Crowe isn't necessarily the first person who comes to mind for such a role, and also the fact that he has already chewed the scenery playing an Italian priest last year in The Pope's Exorcism.\n\nCo-written and directed by Joshua John Miller (alongside screenwriter M.A. Fortin), The Exorcism is certainly self-aware, but for better or worse, it is also more ambitious than your standard possession future. Until the third act, the priority isn't scares and horror but establishing a fractured father-daughter relationship and respective troubles and traumas. Lee has recently been kicked out of school for vandalizing her principal's car, whereas Tony is sober and ready to work again following years-long benders of drinking, drugs, and chasing women in place of caring for his now-deceased terminally ill wife. Taking on the role of a priest is also given another layer with Tony's former experience as an altar boy, with blunt hints at being sexually abused before escaping Catholicism.\n\nAfter some brief auditioning, Tony is hired for the role. However, the film's director, Peter (Adam Goldberg), only seems to have done so because that past will potentially bring out a stronger, more personal performance. That would be fine if he also weren't a verbally abusive jerk without any concern for the emotional well-being of Tony, insulting him for not getting into character enough and, at one point, for having been abused by a priest in the past. It comes across as commentary on the cruelty and single-minded focus on art in which some directors steer a ship, but the material doesn't cut nearly deep enough to make a profound impact.\n\nThat's most likely because The Exorcism is also concerned with teasing the inevitable full-on possession of Tony (this is already a cursed project with the previous actor embodying the role mysteriously having shown up dead) and tossing in some occasional jump scares. What's confounding here is that there are times when the film appears to be deconstructing and poking fun at these modern horror tropes or how generic exorcism movies can be but turns around and indulges in them anyway.\n\nThere are a handful of supporting characters ranging from an actual priest/psychological consultant played by David Hyde Pierce, making for an underexplored dynamic between him and Tony. Lee develops a friendship with the famous Blake (Chloe Bailey) playing the girl getting possessed in the film within the film. At one point, this suddenly turns into something romantic for barely a minute, mostly so demonic Tony has some insult ammunition, although it feels as if there was intended to be a deeper connection here that didn't make it into the final version. Sam Worthington is also here as another actor in a fairly pointless and thankless role.\n\nWhen The Exorcism eventually embraces horror fully, it is simultaneously darkly entertaining and conventionally disappointing. There is no denying a refreshing angle here with the bulky and physically commanding Russell Crowe as the source of possessed danger, inciting violence and mouthing off with the typical shocking sexual dialogue. Sometimes, his kills are also dementedly funny because of this unusual dynamic. However, anything compelling or substantial narratively that the film could have been building towards is shoved aside.\n\nThe Exorcism falls into the trappings it tries to approach differently and avoid. Even with unique ideas and genuinely engaging performances (Russell Crowe is committed here, both in human and demonic form), everything falls apart with no interest in doing anything of note with its meta commentary or themes of abuse and forgiveness.\n\nFlickering Myth Rating - Film: \u2605 \u2605 / Movie: \u2605 \u2605 \u2605", "source": {"uri": "flickeringmyth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Flickering Myth"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_kojder@flickeringmyth.com", "name": "Robert Kojder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

Based, in part, on the urban legends and real-life tragedies surrounding the production of The Exorcist, the film boasts an eye-witness source. Director Joshua John Miller, son of Jason Miller, who played the dark-haired and tortured Father Karras in William Friedkin's 1973 classic, weaponizes the cursed aura of supernatural sabotage that a generation has been hearing about on DVD special features and unsourced film trivia pages for decades. It's a great idea to explore what would happen if an actor in a remake of The Exorcist got possessed. It's a shame The Exorcism can only muster the most boring version of it.\n\nFor the first 30 minutes, Miller, who co-wrote the script with frequent collaborator M.A. Fortin, has some control over the premise. Miller and Fortin's screenplay mixes story beats from William Peter Blatty's Exorcist script, production folklore, and, presumably, Miller's memories of his father's work. The writers also take some influence from one of The Exorcism's producers, patron saint of meta-horror Kevin Williamson. Making up for his absence on Scream 3, Williamson finally helped make a horror movie set within the production of a horror movie. Miller and Fortin aren't strangers to post-modern genre pieces, either. Their script for the 2015 cult horror comedy Final Girls indicates a strong sense of -- or at least interest in -- genre mechanics. They just can't pick the ones they like best.\n\nThe Exorcism opens promisingly enough. Miller offers a one-shot guided tour through the film's most impressive feature: The three-story townhouse cross-section built for the in-film movie set. It's an accurate recreation of the MacNeil home from The Exorcist, too. Off to the side of the house is the cold room, a reference to The Exorcist's legendarily frigid bedroom set, where the climactic exorcism scene occurs. Crowe, too, is smart casting. No stranger to exorcisms, the former Pope's Exorcist plays Tony, a once-prominent alcoholic A-lister on the downslope of his career. Harangued in the press for abandoning his only daughter and dying wife as she went through cancer treatment, Tony books a role in a pseudo remake of The Exorcist called \"The Georgetown Project.\" Now, living with his estranged daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins, who makes a tough role sympathetic), Tony's problems intensify. Georgetown has its own William Friedkin surrogate: Peter (Adam Goldberg), the film's tyrannical director. Peter tortures and belittles Tony as he hopes to use Tony's personal demons for the movie. He gets more than he bargained for.\n\nAs soon as he arrives on set, Tony starts sneaking swigs of Jack Daniels. Providing quiet comfort on set are Lee's love interest and the film's possessed little girl, Blake (Chloe Bailey, who's in this movie more than you'd expect), Tony's co-star Joe (Sam Worthington, in this much less than you'd expect), and Father Connor (David Hyde Pierce, in the perfect amount), the in-universe Catholic advisor.\n\nMiller knows what he's doing here, and the movie works best when it's gently mixing some of Friedkin's flourishes with his own. Tony's possession mirrors Reagan's, making The Exorcism, in some ways, a meta remake itself. The slow zooms, crossfades, and jump cuts Miller employs all evoke the '70s horror aesthetic. Peter all but says the type of movie Miller aspires to make: A psychological drama wrapped inside a horror movie. To do so, the movie tosses in several potential metaphors that possession could attach to, including method acting and alcoholism, both of which track. But throughout the film's inoffensive 95-minute runtime, Miller begins giving way to a more modern and overwhelmingly bluer cinematography. The more he does, the more generic things become.\n\nThe Exorcism had a near-five-year production, and it shows. Shot in 2019, The Exorcism wasn't finished until 2023 due to COVID delays. The result is a movie at odds with itself, throwing out great ideas and then not doing much with them, as if the production ran out of time or money and had to pivot. Miller's intricate set, which resembles The Life Aquatic's Belafonte, never lives up to its promise. Most of the action takes place in Tony's apartment, which, while friendly, is a dramatic step down. Crowe, who offers some subtle, repressed pain and surprising warmth, doesn't play developing stages of possession; he's basically in full-on \"you'll suck cocks in hell\" mode halfway through. It doesn't even occur to Miller and Fortin that a lunatic director making a movie about demonic possession might like the idea of a possessed actor. That's not the kind of movie they want to make.\n\nInstead, Miller focuses all his energy on possession as a metaphor for trauma and alcoholism. It's an appropriate juxtaposition of possession and substance abuse. But Tony also represses some unsubtle church-based trauma, his public disgrace, his familial guilt, his memory issues, his medications, his sleepwalking, and his relationship with Lee. Any one or two of these would round out his character nicely, but the film can't decide. By the climax, The Exorcism is buried in plot points that obscure whatever the power of Christ is compelling us to do.\n\nSo many ideas possess The Exorcism. Too many. Though Miller manages a couple of jump scares in his movie, what makes The Exorcist so scary is how real Friedkin played it. Here, Tony's possession has no ambiguity and, therefore, not much suspense either. For some people, the scariest part of the classic movie is Regan's medical examination, not the pea soup. The Exorcism, for all its talk of alcoholism, never elevates its melodrama to a place of reality. It's not a truly bad movie, but it won't make your head spin.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

The Exorcism is not to be confused with 2023's The Pope's Exorcist, however. This time, Crowe actually plays an actor playing a priest, and we're spared his Italian accent. Otherwise, familiar genre conventions are intact, in a meta kind of way.\n\nAnthony Miller (Crowe) is a troubled star who is hoping to stage a comeback in an equally troubled supernatural horror. His predecessor met an untimely end, and rumor has it the production is cursed. Cue strange events and behavior, not least from Miller himself.\n\nThere's some promise in the idea of a film-within-a-film, and there's also the fascinating fact that director and co-writer Joshua John Miller has a personal connection with 1973's The Exorcist: his dad is Jason Miller, who played Father Damien Karras. While Joshua was born after The Exorcist came out, here Crowe's character has a teenage daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins), to witness the mayhem that transpires.\n\nThe rocky relationship between Lee and her father feels convincing enough, and it's great to see a queer storyline take shape as Lee develops feelings for her father's co-star (Chloe Bailey, one of several strong supporting actors).\n\nBut the horror story leans too heavily into what has now become clich\u00e9, with Crowe's outbursts seeming increasingly ridiculous rather than terrifying. He's at his best expressing regret about his past, rather than wandering around with crazed eyes and a deep voice.\n\nThe Exorcism is released in UK cinemas and US theaters on June 21.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope's_Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pope's Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GamesRadar+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Karras", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damien Karras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clich\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DMswmEZ7aZcecvwgH3KddC-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664509", "eventUri": "eng-9664509", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 1772, "textEnd": 1779}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

That is until he's killed, quickly but gruesomely.\n\nNext, \"The Exorcism\" benefits from the presence of its star, Russell Crowe. Once the star of blockbusters and acclaimed films, such as 1999's \"The Insider\" and 2000s \"Gladiator,\" the New Zealand-born, Australian-raised actor more recently has been front and center of less memorable fare such as \"Unhinged\" and, well, \"The Pope's Exorcist.\" And yet he still has this undeniable gravitational pull when he's within the frame.\n\nInstead of portraying a priest, as he did in last year's \"The Pope's Exorcist,\" he's an actor portraying a priest (what range!) in this movie-in-a-movie affair.\n\nCrowe's Tony Miller only snagged the gig after the other actor's death, this being the former's first meaningful gig after years of public, alcohol-fueled embarrassments. He now wonders if his late wife's battle with cancer was really the excuse for this self-destructive behavior he once thought it was.\n\n\"Her being sick gave me a reason to just disconnect,\" he tells an unseen priest during a Catholic confession.\n\nBefore filming begins, his attitude-filled 16-year-old daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins, \"Sherrybaby\") -- who calls him \"Tony,\" which he doesn't love -- returns home, her father having pulled strings to get her school expulsion reduced to a suspension.\n\nSoon, they're both on set, Lee working as a production assistant and Tony immediately disappointing the film's high-minded director, Peter (Adam Goldberg), who believes he's making a psychological drama disguised as a horror flick. Peter has no reservations about trying to pull a better performance from Tony by reminding him of his recent failures as a person, as well as his traumatic time years earlier as an altar boy.\n\nTony begins to unravel, but, of course, there may be something darker than subpar acting afoot.\n\nThat's all well and fine, and, for a while, \"The Exorcism\" is intermittently -- if also only mildly -- scary as Tony takes his work and demons home with Lee. Before long, though, this roughly 90-minute offering is going predictably over-the-top, with an unmistakably otherworldly on-set incident involving Tony somehow not shutting down the production.\n\nLike the movie-within-the-movie, \"The Exorcism\" trudges on, with supporting players who include wonderful-to-see \"Frasier\" alum David Hyde Pierce, playing a priest with a degree in psychology consulting on the production; \"Avatar\" franchise star (and fellow Aussie) Sam Worthington, as an actor who looks up to Tony and also is playing a priest; and singer-songwriter Chloe Bailey, as an actress who portrays the young woman who becomes possessed in the film and who becomes romantically entangled with Lee.\n\n(It seems possible the film being made in \"The Exorcism\" is a remake of \"The Exorcist,\" which, in reality, saw the reboot effort \"The Exorcist: Believer\" be poorly received last year by audience members and critics alike. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter.)\n\nIf the meta aspects of \"The Exorcism\" bring to mind the ongoing \"Scream\" movie franchise, it won't come as a shock to learn its creator, Kevin Williamson, is counted among its producers.\n\nIn their filmmakers' statement, MIller and Fortin say they began writing the film in 2019, when, during the presidency of Donald J. Trump, they watched \"certain segments of the Christian faith go after LGBT folks\" and \"there wasn't much that didn't feel cursed anymore.\"\n\nSome of that emotion does come through in \"The Exorcism,\" which is commendable. However, it doesn't change the fact that at best this is a quick-and-easy popcorn movie when -- given its inspiration, structure and connection to \"The Exorcist\" -- it could have been something more.\n\nRated: R for language, some violent content, sexual references and brief drug use.", "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_meszoros@news-herald.com", "name": "Mark Meszoros", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

If anything, it's deeply disturbing. But there's a pretty good joke at the end of the credits if you wait around long enough. Although almost every movie claims in the fine print that \"any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental,\" there's no way in hell they expect us to actually believe it this time. It's gotta be a gag.\n\n\"The Exorcism\" tells the story of Anthony Miller, an alcoholic and a drug addict in recovery, who threw away his lucrative and respected career as a motion picture actor. When the star of a remake of \"The Exorcist,\" called \"The Georgetown Project,\" dies under mysterious circumstances, Miller accepts the job but falls retreats into his old vices, overwhelmed by horrifying childhood memories and, possibly, a real supernatural force. Only his teenaged child, a queer screenwriter named Lee (Ryan Simpkins, \"Fear Street\"), seems to care that he's deteriorating. Can Anthony Miller truly be saved before he kills himself... or Lee?\n\nThis film was directed and co-written by Joshua John Miller, a former child actor who co-starred in the 1980s cult classics \"Near Dark\" and \"Teen Witch.\" Miller's father was Jason Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, Tony Award-winning, Oscar-nominated star of \"The Exorcist.\" After the slasher comedy \"The Final Girls,\" this marks the second screenplay Miller has co-written with M.A. Fortin about a teenager with a horror-movie actor for a parent, who finds themselves trapped inside of a horror movie for real.\n\nIf that's a coincidence it's the biggest coincidence of all time.\n\nThe thing is, both \"The Final Girls\" and \"The Exorcism\" are exceptionally interesting. \"The Final Girls\" is a meta-comedy version of this story, a whimsical genre subversion with a surprisingly big heart. \"The Exorcism\" is the ominous, tortured version of the same tale. Individually they are intriguing genre exercises. Taken as a whole they form a riveting and complicated dyad.\n\nRussell Crowe gained much of his early notoriety from displays of on-screen power in films like \"Romper Stomper,\" \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"Gladiator.\" But he's never more devastating than when he's meek. Anthony Miller is a sad, wounded man and taking on the role of a Catholic priest is especially harrowing for him, because he was the victim of sexual violence as an altar boy. His director, Peter (Adam Goldberg), has no qualms about stoking Anthony's substance abuse, his guilt over his dead wife, and his childhood pain, just to get a realistic performance.\n\n\"Tony,\" Peter says, \"You are irredeemable,\" and that's one of nicer things Anthony hears on set. There is a sentence that comes out of Adam Goldberg's mouth that is so shockingly cruel that you half expect god, the devil, or at least the director to kill the character right then and there.\n\n\"The Exorcism\" is not a subtle movie, and there is no rule that says any movie has to be. Cinematographer Simon Duggan (\"Furiosa\") shoots the film as though every scene has bags under its eyes. The darkness inches in from the edge of each frame, giving the impression that \"The Exorcism\" is playing out in an uncomfortably tiny black box theater. This is an opportunity to dig deep into the pulsating meat of an actor's soul, to scoop out their bloody guilt and show it to us.\n\nThe title refers to the movie-within-a-movie. It also refers to Anthony Miller, who may actually need a real-life exorcism before this movie ends. And before the closing credits, it may also apply to Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce), \"The Georgetown Project's\" technical consultant, and a stand-in for the Catholic Church itself. He's kind and sensitive and listens to everyone's problems, but when Lee and her new girlfriend, Anthony's co-star Blake (Chloe Bailey, \"Swarm\"), turn to him for help, Father Conor says he'll do something. And it sure as hell looks like he waits until it's probably too late to follow up on that.\n\nThe production of \"The Exorcist\" was, according to urban legend, itself quite haunted. \"The Exorcism\" suggests that the reason movies about the devil feel cursed is because the Catholic Church itself is cursed. It's got more demons than Regan MacNeil ever did. And those demons come back in a big way, and their victims still need help, damn it. Getting to the heart of a story about faith when your faith has been brutally exploited would leave anyone feeling hollow, and in the rush to fill that void Miller turns to substance abuse, and lets a real demon in.\n\n\"The Exorcism\" can be clunky. When Peter claims the movie-within-the-movie is \"a psychological drama wrapped in the skin of a horror film,\" it is perfectly acceptable to roll your eyes and yell \"We get it!\" right back at the screen. But this disturbing riff on \"The Country Girl\" (the country ghoul?) never seems anything less than earnest and sometimes -- all puns intended -- a little confessional. The skin of the horror movie is a little ill-fitting. \"The Exorcism\" only truly terrifies when it's about a tortured parent lashing out against their own flesh-and-blood.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_bibbiani@thewrap.com", "name": "William Bibbiani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Miller_(wide_receiver,_born_1994)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Miller (wide receiver, born 1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgetown_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Georgetown Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.

Joshua John Miller (2024)", "body": "After starring in The Pope's Exorcist and now The Exorcism, it is safe to say that Russell Crowe is firmly in his demonic possession era. Although releasing this week, The Exorcism was actually made prior to The Pope's Exorcist, and is far less conventional than that film. Rather than follow the classic structure of a priest helping a tormented teenager, The Exorcism mixes things up by setting itself on a film set.\n\nCrowe plays actor Tony who finds himself starring as a priest in a film about demonic possession. As the filming gets underway Tony finds himself the target of a malevolent spirit drawn to set by the authenticity within the script. As Tony begins to succumb, it is left to his estranged daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins) to try and save his soul. With The Exorcism, director Joshua John Miller attempts to inject new life into the tired formula. The idea of a possessed movie set is sound, but unfortunately some of the execution is lacking, and there is a clear reason why, despite being made in 2019, it has taken so long to come to light. The Exorcism takes itself far more seriously than The Pope's Exorcist, and its more po-faced tone reverts it back into generic possession territory.\n\nThe biggest pitfall of The Exorcism is that everything feels flat. Although the father / child relationship is interesting to see develop, it has been explored too many times before and doesn't add any real freshness. More than that Miller uses possession as a metaphor for Tony's struggles with addiction and sadly the message is as subtle as a hit to the head. Drawing the parallels to addiction also serve to drive away the horror elements. With time spent on this side of the story, Miller forgoes the anticipated jump scares and moments of suspense, creating a horror film that the less imaginative genre watchers will be disappointed with. There is horror to be found if you look closely, but those expecting a rollercoaster of thrills will be severely underwhelmed.\n\nThe Exorcism\n\nKat Hughes\n\nThe Exorcism\n\nSummary\n\nA disappointing entry into the exorcism pantheon, The Exorcism has fun ideas, but sadly they aren't pushed as hard as they could or should be.\n\n2 Call To Action\n\nRelated TopicsThe Exorcism Kat Hughes\n\nKat Hughes is a UK born film critic and interviewer who has a passion for horror films.

He's been away from the job after battling addiction and the death of his wife. An act of horrific misfortune for another actor presents an opportunity. Tony can star in a remake of a famous horror movie. That movie is not directly named, but the title of this film probably gives you a good idea of what movie that is.\n\nUnfortunately, there's something amiss with the set of this film. Tony is playing a priest who is here to exorcise a young girl (played by singer Chloe Bailey). But here might be something actually demonic on set targeting him.\n\nIn the background, Tony's teen daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins -- Fear Street) struggles to reconnect with her father but begins to form a relationship with his younger co-star. This brings her back into her dad's world. The problem is that something is clearly not right with him and appears to be getting worse.\n\nThe first act is really strong, with the family drama putting in a strong yet understated showing. The creeping sense of a cursed movie within a movie is intriguing. There have been some fantastic modern examples, including Prano Bailey-Bond's Censor, but the early promise unspools in an extremely messy back half.\n\nBut there's sincerity in what Joshua John Miller is making. His own history in the horror genre includes childhood parts in Kathryn Bigelow's vampire movie Near Dark and Tommy Lee Wallace's Halloween III. More recently, he wrote the similarily meta script for The Final Girls. His own family history is also replete with industry connections, and one in particular makes a lot of sense in what The Exorcism is going for.\n\nThat's because Miller's father was John Anthony Miller, best known for playing Father Damien Karras in William Friedkin's The Exorcist. That knowledge massively accentuates the film's opening act. The burden of legacy is laid bare on multiple levels. Even as the movie begins to lose its way in the latter half, Russell Crowe retains a tragic visage. Perhaps even for Crowe, this feels a little personal. Indeed, he certainly imbibes his performance with the weight of a man who's been through it to some degree.\n\nSadly, something shifts in the makeup of The Exorcism, which robs it of its intrigue and dramatic quality. The movie has suffered multiple delays, and there's evidence of some significant interference from outside forces. You can almost pinpoint where executive doubt crept in. It's at that point things devolve into the kind of boring possession movie nonsense. A decision that seems like a knee-jerk reframing of the movie. Possibly one to fit better what people might have expected out of a Russell Crowe exorcism movie in a post-The Pope's Exorcist world.\n\nCharacter arcs feel either undercooked or haphazardly dissected. Adam Goldberg's director and David Hyde Pierce's priest feel like they're missing pieces to their own stories, while Sam Worthington's eager younger actor is given next to nothing to work with. He does star in the film's standout scare, at least.\n\nMore evidence of second-half shenanigans is that the \"film within a film\" aspect of the story effectively drops to the wayside. Consequently, it only briefly cropped up again unearned at the film's climax. When you're going to riff on the idea of remaking The Exorcist, it really has to be followed through to ensure it's not a pointless exercise. For one reason or another, that didn't happen for Miller's movie.\n\nThere's no doubt that whatever the quality of The Exorcism, it would have been judged by the intensely hot glare of The Exorcist. Let's be fair; every possession movie with a religious perspective is going to be judged by that standard. And for good reason too. But when the final act is a glum broth of stale tropes and disjointed pacing, it only makes the glare burn fiercer. Crowe and company cannot fight against whatever sinister forces exist outside of the screen. A cruel meta nod of its own\n\nIt's a shame because it's clear something interesting was being made. It's not necessarily groundbreaking in an increasingly exhausted arena, but it's a more intimate, tragic tale of people and the film industry that gets drowned out by the worst habits of the genre.\n\nScore: 5/10\n\nAs ComingSoon's review policy explains, a score of 5 is \"Mediocre\".

His estranged daughter wonders if he's slipping back into his past addictions or if there's something more sinister at play.\n\nREVIEW: Just last year, we saw the release of The Pope's Exorcist, and now, less than one year later, we've got Russell Crowe returning to the genre with a similar title. But outside of being about possession and starring Russell Crowe, these films could not be more different. Announced 5 years ago and even filmed before Pope's Exorcist, The Exorcism was hit with delay after delay. That's not often a great sign concerning a movie's quality, but the June release seemed to show a little more faith in the product than expected. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver anything outside of some decent performances.\n\nThe Exorcism follows Russell Crowe's Anthony Miller, a struggling actor who recently booked a role in a horror movie after something tragic happened to the prior actor. He starts exhibiting strange behavior as it's clear something much more sinister is going on. His daughter, Lee (Simpkins), is working as a production assistant on the film and is trying to repair her fractured relationship with her father. Saying Crowe is great in the role is a bit like saying water is wet; no matter the film, he always delivers. But the Tony character falls into the box of an alcoholic, neglectful dad and has a hard time getting out of it.\n\nThis is really Ryan Simpkins' film, as her reactions to Tony's behavior are where the true horror lies. Anyone who's lived with an addict knows the pain of a relapse, and the viewer experiences Tony's destructive behavior through his daughter. Using alcoholism to portray the possession was an interesting choice. Simpkins is able to say so much with so little, and it was easily my favorite part of the film. Chloe Bailey works well as the actor Lee knows from her past and is a bit of a love interest. I'd argue the character's interactions are ultimately pointless, but it's nice that not everything in Lee's life is a mess.\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce shows up in a fun role as a priest. He gets a bit of duality in his performance and really gets to go hard in the third act. If anything, I wanted more of him playing evil, even if his good-guy schtick also works incredibly well. Sam Worthington shows up in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it part that made me question why they even cast such a big actor for the role. And I'm absolutely flummoxed at Adam Goldberg's Peter, the director. This character is such an asshole and spits such vitriol that I was shocked to see no real comeuppance for him. This is why very little of this works despite going into some dark places. If you're going to set something up, you need to pay it off.\n\nGiven the writer/director's relationship to the material, maybe the story's point was lost along the way. There are times when logic exits the scene, and we're just left with a sloppy narrative progression. Not much thought is put into the why, so the scenes feel very slapped together. I was shocked this came from the writing team of The Final Girls, given how tightly paced and genre-aware that script was. Instead, this is just teeming with cliches and lacking in any true scares. Hell, the jump scares in this one aren't set up and are \"cat jumps out of the closet\" level of obnoxious.\n\nIt's not all bad: I really enjoyed the sets, in particular the \"dollhouse\" which was the filming location for the film within a film. As a house cut in half, it provides a very interesting visual that evolves throughout the movie. But anytime you dig deeper into The Exorcism, it's a very shallow experience. While I liked the performances, they exist within such one-dimensional characters. Lee's focus on Blake takes the toll of what Tony is going through and its effect on Lee, and pushes it into less intense territory. If she has enough time to focus on love, then the horror going on around her can't be all that bad.\n\nI wouldn't be shocked if people see an advertisement for another Crowe Exorcism film and buy tickets based on the merits of The Pope's Exorcist. But that would be a massive mistake as the two films could not be more different. There's no fun to be had here, and the subject matter is absolutely dour. From pedophilia within the church to intense alcoholism to an extremely toxic set, this is a rough viewing. And if those elements were handled with a bit more grace, this could have been a truly terrifying experience. Instead, it's bad CGI, loud noises, and a demon that cares more about plot convenience than actual horror.", "source": {"uri": "joblo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JoBlo's Movie Emporium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_nichols@joblo.com", "name": "Tyler Nichols", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope's_Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pope's Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Worthington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_scare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jump scare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_within_a_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Story within a story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.joblo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/russell-crowe-the-exorcism-social-featured.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664509", "eventUri": "eng-9664509", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The 1973 movie was even nominated for 10 Oscars and won 2, unheard of in the genre at that time. It has been endlessly imitated for the past half century right up to now, notably David Gordon Green's critically reviled 2023 reboot The Exorcist: Believer which even brought original Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn back into the fold after all these decades. But the OG is impossible to touch, so what was going through Joshua John Miller's mind when he decided to take on a new film so closely linked to it?\n\nDirector and co-writer (with M.A. Fortin) of The Exorcism, Miller has the 1973 film in his family bones, even if he wasn't born until a year after its release. His father is Jason Miller, the late playwright and actor who so memorably played the doomed Father Karras who jumped out the window during the climactic exorcism in Friedkin's film. It brought him an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor, and as his son says he often would tell him the infamous stories of the film's making in which, lore would have it, several people connected with it died or were haunted by it in the ensuing years. Even a book has been written on all of this.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nWith all this background in mind, plus the demons of the Trump era in their heads. Miller and Fortin began writing The Exorcism in 2019, setting it cleverly as a movie, \"The Georgetown Project\", within a movie about the making of a film eerily like The Exorcist in which the demons start to take over, particularly for the film's leading man, Tony Miller (the last name no accident) played by Russell Crowe as a down-on-his-luck former action star beset with alcoholism and drug use because of his own demons after feeling guilty for abandoning his wife during her fatal illness, and their teen daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins). Trying to make a professional and personal comeback, he auditions for the role of Father Arlington, the exorcist in a new film being directed by a rather tyrannical filmmaker, Peter (the middle name of 1973 film's writer, heh heh) out for authenticity who hires him and basically psychologically tortures Tony into giving him the performance he craves. As we learn in the film's creepy opening the original actor cast in the role mysteriously dies on the set and had to be quickly replaced. The curse is on. Or is it?\n\nMiller and Fortin are looking for much more here than a standard exorcism film though, and much is made of Tony's renewed attempts to win back the love and trust of his 16 year old daughter as circumstances bring them back together and she begins to notice his crumbling condition, helping him not only at home but also on set as a production assistant. Real life problems merge with reel life problems as Tony's immersion into this character takes on unforseen dimensions and, well, terror.\n\nCrowe lifts this material significantly, even if it might appear to be a paycheck movie for this celebrated Oscar winner. Just a year after his starring role as a real life Vatican priest and exorcist in the underrated The Pope's Exorcist he is back in the genre, but fear not it is demonstrably different as we watch Tony's own demons get out of hand. Unfortunately for the film though it also falls prey to the tropes of the genre and sails out of control in the final third thereby squandering its intriguing premise and succumbing to the suits who demand the stereotypical frights for this kind of movie.\n\nGoldberg, perhaps morphing into the kind of demanding director the late great Friedkin was rumored to be in making his masterpiece, is fitfully amusing as a filmmaker with only his own needs on his mind, much to dismay of his star. Sam Worthington as Joe, a co-star who plays the sidekick for Tony is sadly given little to work with here, as is the lively Chloe Bailey as another co-star and musician. David Hyde Pierce is earnest to a fault as the priest hired as a consultant for the film, but the character doesn't quite seem to gel.\n\nIn the end The Exorcism, despite the best efforts of Crowe and the initial promise of taking the familiar into unfamiliar territory, just doesn't quite gel itself, but I will give it an Amen for the game effort.\n\nProducers for the Miramax Production are Kevin Williamson (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer), Bill Block, and Ben Fast.\n\nCast: Russell Crowe, Adam Goldberg, Ryan Simpkins, David Hyde Pierce, Chloe Bailey, Sam Worthington", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Peter_Blatty", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Peter Blatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

Now that I've seen \"The Exorcism,\" I appreciate \"The Pope's Exorcist\" even more. At least that movie was somewhat enjoyable on a cheesy level, unlike \"The Exorcism,\" which is drab, morose, and ultimately weak. But I'll say this for Crowe: just as in \"The Pope's Exorcist,\" he's not phoning it in. He seems fully committed to his part here, even if the movie itself feels beneath him.\n\nThe most frustrating thing about \"The Exorcism\" is that it has a lot of potential. This is one of those movies where the concept and the behind-the-scenes details are more interesting than the movie itself. For instance: this horror pic was actually shot in 2019, before \"The Pope's Exorcist,\" but is only seeing the light of day now. And here's another interesting detail: \"The Exorcism\" is co-written and directed by Joshua John Miller, son of Jason Miller, star of the most famous and influential exorcism movie of all time, \"The Exorcist.\" But wait, there's more! \"The Exorcism\" is about an actor starring in a remake of \"The Exorcist\"! A movie about the remake of \"The Exorcist\" being directed by the son of the guy who starred in \"The Exorcist\" is one of those meta-details that catches your attention. Throw in the fact that Kevin Williamson, writer of \"Scream, is credited as a producer here, and you've got plenty of potential. Sadly, that potential is squandered as the film descends into hoary cliches and CGI ghoul faces.

Joshua Miller directed and co-wrote the script with M.A. Fortin.\n\n\"We really wanted to keep that queer storyline in there, being queer filmmakers,\" Miller told UPI in a recent Zoom interview. \"Some people were thinking it wasn't as addictive.\"\n\nIn the story, Anthony Miller (Crowe) is estranged from Hollywood and his daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins). Anthony gets a second chance to star in a film, and redeems himself with Lee after his drug addiction caused them to become estranged previously.\n\nLee has a relationship with another crew member (Chloe Bailey), and it is the queer girls who end up performing the exorcism. Fortin added that women exorcizing a man is a reversal of traditional exorcisms between a male priest and a female subject.\n\n\"If we're going to play around with Catholic dogma, we're not going to be slaves to Catholic dogma,\" Fortin said. \"That was something we weren't really willing to bend on.\"\n\nSimpkins, who came out in 2020 and goes by they/she pronouns, said her character's queerness drew her to the role.\n\n\"One of the key themes of the movie is this younger woman working her way through this patriarchal system and making sure she stays true to herself,\" Simpkins said. \"Being a young queer woman in the film industry was also something I related to.\"\n\nSimpkins said she struggled with whether to come out, worrying that it might limit the roles in which she would be cast. Since coming out, Simpkins said, the opposite has been true.\n\n\"I think gender is a performance, and I think it has only let me go further into that performance,\" Simpkins said. \"I get to play queer characters. I've played men since then.\"\n\nOne subplot that fell by the wayside in the final cut is that of Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce), the Catholic adviser to the film within the film. Pierce said he hopes an extended cut of The Exorcism one day restores his full storyline.\n\n\"This is not the first time he has found himself confronting this kind of evil,\" Pierce teased.\n\nEven in the final cut, Conor is the most skeptical when people suggest Anthony is possessed.\n\n\"For quite a while, he doesn't buy it,\" Pierce said. \"They're getting caught up in the story that they're filming, and they think these real things are happening, but it's very rare that this stuff happens.\"\n\nPierce did not have a priest consult on his performance like Crowe's character did. Instead, Pierce remembered Episcopal priests he knew growing up.\n\nIn one scene, out of habit, Pierce recited an extra verse from the Episcopal version of The Lord's Prayer. He made sure to advise his director to cut before that verse.\n\n\"So I said, 'Don't include these words in the film because a Catholic priest wouldn't say that,'\" Pierce said.\n\nThe Exorcism takes place in the second film directed by Miller, and 25 years apart. Miller was a child actor in the '80s and '90s in horror movies like Near Dark and comedies like Teen Witch.\n\nMiller's father, Jason Miller, played the young priest Father Karras in The Exorcist, who Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) mentors. Miller said The Exorcism is less an homage to his father and more of a tribute to his mother, who died before he and Fortin wrote it.\n\n\"There was that moment of wow, she's still gone,\" Miller said of his realization after completing the film. \"To put that expectation on the process of making something, it's going to somehow heal you, I think, is hard.\"\n\nAlong with the film's themes, the cast had to deliver when it came to the exorcism scene. Crowe performed as a man possibly possessed.\n\nPierce had to play the traditional priest role, including offering his body to the demon.\n\n\"It's challenging learning the language if you're speaking a lot of Latin,\" Pierce said. \"You also have to have great confidence in your director and in the special effects people because you really go out on a limb as an actor.\"\n\nSimpkins said she auditioned with the exorcism scene.

Not so much the monster or horror elements -- but more the spirituality, which he said appeals to a small part of our brains that wonders whether by uttering a certain incantation, we might be inviting trouble. It doesn't make logical sense, but there's something undeniably powerful about the idea.\n\nPierce admitted, \"The first time I picked up the Catholic ritual for exorcism and started reading it -- I wasn't even reading it aloud, I was just reading it in my brain -- and I stopped and I thought, 'If I keep reading this, is something bad going to happen in the middle of the living room? Is somebody going to appear?'\"\n\n\"I think it's because of movies like The Exorcist. We all have that in our bloodstream, or a million movies like it that have come since,\" Pierce added. \"This world of, 'Oh, don't say the wrong thing or you'll open up a whole universe.' That used to be how people lived in the Middle Ages or whatever -- that's how they saw the world -- but we've got the entertainment world to bring that alive again. I think the reason these movies work is because there's some part of us that goes, 'Is that possible? Is that going to happen?'\"\n\nThere's quite a bit of stuff to dig into. According to the director of The Exorcism, he and his co-writer originally published it as a true story about the making of The Exorcist -- a movie in which his father starred.\n\nOf course, both the movie The Exorcist and the events that inspired it are pretty well-documented. Over the years, while there may never have been a movie about the making of The Exorcist, there have been countless film and video interviews that provide fans with a lot of insight. In 2014, filmmakers Christopher Saint Booth and Philip Adrian Booth made The Exorcist File, a documentary about the cast that inspired the movie, which was filmed partially on site at the house where the exorcism in question actually took place. You can find that movie on Tubi and Prime Video.\n\nIn The Exorcism, Academy Award winner Russell Crowe stars as Anthony Miller, a troubled actor who begins to unravel while shooting a supernatural horror film.

Kill! Kill!' Helped Joshua John Miller Find His Place as a Cult Filmmaker", "body": "Director Joshua John Miller's \"The Exorcism\" opens nationwide June 21, but one theater showing it holds a particularly special place in his heart: Quentin Tarantino's Vista Theater in Hollywood. Not only will the Vista screen \"The Exorcism\" in 35mm, but Tarantino has programmed Russ Meyer's 1965 cult classic \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" as a midnight show following Miller's film on June 21 and June 22. \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" stars Miller's mother, Susan Bernard, who passed away five years ago, and \"The Exorcism\" is a film inspired by his father, Jason Miller, who played Father Karras in \"The Exorcist\" and ended up working in lower-budget horror films like \"Mommy\" and \"The Eternal.\"\n\nIn \"The Exorcism,\" Russell Crowe plays an actor with a troubled past who sees a shot at redemption in a new role as a priest in a remake of a famous horror film -- unnamed in Miller and M.A. Fortin's script, but clearly \"The Exorcist.\" Strange accidents plague the shoot, however, and Crowe's character begins to unravel, the seeming victim of possession himself. The movie cleverly riffs on the stories Miller (and every other horror fan) heard his whole life about \"The Exorcist\" allegedly being a cursed film, though the greatness of \"The Exorcism\" is the way that it gets at something deeper; in its penetrating character study of an actor coming apart, it plays like a horror version of John Cassavetes' \"Opening Night,\" something Miller says was entirely intentional.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n\"People have asked, 'Were there cursed events on the set of \"The Exorcist,\" and how was your father adversely affected by this mythology?'\" Miller told IndieWire. \"And I would say fame was his biggest curse.\" The same year that \"The Exorcist\" was released, Miller won the Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for his play \"That Championship Season,\" when just a few years earlier he had been selling plasma to help support his family. \"That supernova effect created a shadow that was almost impossible to get out from under, and I think that haunted him deeply. After 'The Exorcist,' he very much wanted to make a movie of his play, and that was a Herculean effort that never came to pass in the way that he imagined. It was a disaster in terms of how he imagined its success, and I think that haunted him as well.\"\n\nJason Miller's despair over never being able to live up to his early successes ultimately haunted not only him but his entire family as he succumbed to alcoholism and drug addiction, much like Crowe's character in \"The Exorcism.\" \"Sometimes it's hard to have empathy when you're the child of an addict,\" Miller said. \"You're mostly just pissed off. But over the years, you grow up and realize your dad could be both good and bad. The two things can coexist. This was a movie that was an attempt to paint a portrait of somebody who always seemed deeply tortured to me by regrets and this avalanche of bad choices. The mythology of the cursed movie was just the icing on the cake -- I was really much more interested in that subterranean psychological warfare that was going on inside of him.\"\n\nWhile \"The Exorcism\" is a tribute to his father, Miller's previous screenplay \"The Final Girls\" was a love letter to his mother, whose role in \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" came as a surprise to Miller when he was a teenager. \"The first time I heard about that movie was when a friend came up to me in high school and said, 'I saw your mom in an X-rated movie,'\" Miller said. \"I went to the video store and they wouldn't let me rent it because it was X-rated -- technically unrated, but they were calling it X-rated. I went to my mom and said, 'You're in a movie that's X-rated?' She said, 'I've been meaning to talk to you about this,' and I was sitting there going, 'Oh my God, my mom was a porn star?'\"\n\nBernard explained to her son that the movie was not pornography but a piece of art celebrating female sexuality. \"She said, 'Russ had a vision and I want you to see it. It's a beautiful movie,'\" Miller said. \"I watched it and fell in love with it, and I still love it. As a queer person, I think there's a reason why queer people love his films. There's such a revolt against any kind of heteronormative portrayal of sexuality that you feel like, oh, this is a queer-friendly space. The women are so empowered, and there are shades of lesbianism as well. Russ showed that there's a place for transgressive cinema and that you can work outside the system and create your own empire, no matter how small or big that is. He said, 'I'm going to do what I want to do and I don't want to join the system. I'm going to be punk rock and I'm going to go make my movies over here.'\"\n\nThat example helped Miller find his own place as a transgressive filmmaker and embrace his genre roots as a child actor in films like \"Near Dark,\" \"Class of 1999,\" and \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch.\" \"As a kid actor, all I ever wanted was to be on a TV show,\" Miller said. \"I didn't really have a conventional family, so somehow being a kid in a family on ABC seemed like the perfect way to have one. But no one would cast me because I guess I seemed like I would just kill everybody. So I got cast in movies as a vampire, as a murderer.\" Eventually, Miller realized that the world of horror and B-movies was not something to run from but something to celebrate. \"It took time for me to realize, this is where I belong, and these people are my tribe.\"\n\nIn keeping with that spirit, Miller says that for his next film, he'll probably go back to something a little lower budget and outside the system than \"The Exorcism.\" \"I think that's where I belong,\" he said. For now, he's just thrilled to share the Vista with his mom on opening weekend and honor the legacy of B-movies that he inherited from her and his father. \"I love watching my mom in that movie and realizing that she came to terms with the fact that she was part of something really cool as opposed to something to be embarrassed by. It's a bit supernatural that opening night falls on the five-year anniversary of her passing, but she'll be somewhere in the building on celluloid.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quentin Tarantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Meyer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russ Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IndieWire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

The 1973 movie was even nominated for 10 Oscars and won 2, unheard of in the genre at that time. It has been endlessly imitated for the past half century right up to now, notably David Gordon Green's critically reviled 2023 reboot The Exorcist: Believer which even brought original Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn back into the fold after all these decades. But the OG is impossible to touch, so what was going through Joshua John Miller's mind when he decided to take on a new film so closely linked to it?\n\nDirector and co-writer (with M.A. Fortin) of The Exorcism, Miller has the 1973 film in his family bones, even if he wasn't born until a year after its release. His father is Jason Miller, the late playwright and actor who so memorably played the doomed Father Karras who jumped out the window during the climactic exorcism in Friedkin's film. It brought him an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor, and as his son says he often would tell him the infamous stories of the film's making in which, lore would have it, several people connected with it died or were haunted by it in the ensuing years. Even a book has been written on all of this.\n\nWith all this background in mind, plus the demons of the Trump era in their heads. Miller and Fortin began writing The Exorcism in 2019, setting it cleverly as a movie, \"The Georgetown Project\", within a movie about the making of a film eerily like The Exorcist in which the demons start to take over, particularly for the film's leading man, Tony Miller (the last name no accident) played by Russell Crowe as a down-on-his-luck former action star beset with alcoholism and drug use because of his own demons after feeling guilty for abandoning his wife during her fatal illness, and their teen daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins). Trying to make a professional and personal comeback, he auditions for the role of Father Arlington, the exorcist in a new film being directed by a rather tyrannical filmmaker, Peter (the middle name of 1973 film's writer, heh heh) out for authenticity who hires him and basically psychologically tortures Tony into giving him the performance he craves. As we learn in the film's creepy opening the original actor cast in the role mysteriously dies on the set and had to be quickly replaced. The curse is on. Or is it?\n\nMiller and Fortin are looking for much more here than a standard exorcism film though, and much is made of Tony's renewed attempts to win back the love and trust of his 16 year old daughter as circumstances bring them back together and she begins to notice his crumbling condition, helping him not only at home but also on set as a production assistant. Real life problems merge with reel life problems as Tony's immersion into this character takes on unforseen dimensions and, well, terror.\n\nCrowe lifts this material significantly, even if it might appear to be a paycheck movie for this celebrated Oscar winner. Just a year after his starring role as a real life Vatican priest and exorcist in the underrated The Pope's Exorcist he is back in the genre, but fear not it is demonstrably different as we watch Tony's own demons get out of hand. Unfortunately for the film though it also falls prey to the tropes of the genre and sails out of control in the final third thereby squandering its intriguing premise and succumbing to the suits who demand the stereotypical frights for this kind of movie.\n\nGoldberg, perhaps morphing into the kind of demanding director the late great Friedkin was rumored to be in making his masterpiece, is fitfully amusing as a filmmaker with only his own needs on his mind, much to dismay of his star. Sam Worthington as Joe, a co-star who plays the sidekick for Tony is sadly given little to work with here, as is the lively Chloe Bailey as another co-star and musician. David Hyde Pierce is earnest to a fault as the priest hired as a consultant for the film, but the character doesn't quite seem to gel.\n\nIn the end The Exorcism, despite the best efforts of Crowe and the initial promise of taking the familiar into unfamiliar territory, just doesn't quite gel itself, but I will give it an Amen for the game effort.\n\nProducers for the Miramax Production are Kevin Williamson (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer), Bill Block, and Ben Fast.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pete_hammond@deadline.com", "name": "Pete Hammond", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Peter_Blatty", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Peter Blatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

Horror films often tap into ancient fears rooted in myth; this is just a more modern one. As one character tells another, \"All kinds of things happen on the sets of devil movies.\" Then she names a few examples: \"'The Omen,' 'The Exorcist,' 'Poltergeist.'\" It's true -- over decades, stories of freak accidents and deaths on those sets have grown into the kind of lore that can power its own horror film.\n\nThat \"The Exorcist\" is named in this list is a little funny, since the film-within-the-film is clearly just a variant on William Friedkin's influential 1973 classic. The nested movie is even called \"The Georgetown Project,\" a reference to the setting of \"The Exorcist.\" (\"The Exorcism,\" directed by Joshua John Miller from a screenplay he wrote with M.A. Fortin, seems named to provoke the comparison, too, though that also makes talking about it a little confusing.) What's more, the first scene in \"The Exorcism\" reveals that \"The Georgetown Project\" is about a priest having a crisis of faith who is called to cast a demon out of a teenage girl, and that the house built on the soundstage is a dead ringer for the more famous movie's set. In other words: In \"The Exorcism,\" they're basically making \"The Exorcist.\"\n\nReligious horror -- which is to say, horror movies that specifically evoke religious imagery -- can be hopelessly hokey, thoughtlessly appropriative, or thoughtful. I'd put \"The Exorcist,\" one of Hollywood's best meditations on faith and doubt, in the thoughtful camp, and for the first half-hour of \"The Exorcism,\" I though it would land there too. It's about a famous actor named Tony Miller (Russell Crowe, looking sufficiently tortured), whose addictions and grief have recently derailed his career and life. He is given a chance to star as a priest in \"The Georgetown Project\" by its cranky jerk of a director (Adam Goldberg) after the role is suddenly and violently vacated. Tony thinks it is the salvation he needs.\n\nCatholic symbology plays an outsized role in horror -- thanks, in no small part, to the influence of \"The Exorcist.\" Often movies end up grappling with whether the words, rites and sacramental objects of the Catholic church have power of their own, regardless of the beliefs and righteousness of the wielder. \"The Exorcism\" dips into this inquiry but goes further. In this movie, Catholicism is both the villain and the hero.\n\nTony's sardonic 16-year-old daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins), for instance, shows up at home because she has been suspended from her Catholic boarding school for protesting the principal's choice to fire her gay guidance counselor. She and Tony have a fraught relationship given Tony's checkered past, which, we come to realize, has something to do with a horrifying experience from his days as an altar boy.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgetown_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Georgetown Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omen_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Omen (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poltergeist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.

Now The Exorcism is aiming to cast a similarly dark spell. Our hero is becoming quite the demon for such projects\n\nThis week, a new Russell Crowe movie is released. The film concerns a demon that comes to inhabit a person, and the struggles of a priest to cast the demon out. You might have seen its poster, in which Russell Crowe wears a dog collar and clutches a crucifix.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it might be because it has only been a matter of months since the last time that Russell Crowe starred in a film about a demon that comes to inhabit a person, and the struggles of a priest to cast the demon out, that had a poster in which Russell Crowe wears a dog collar and clutches a crucifix. That film was The Pope's Exorcist. This new one is called The Exorcism. Do keep up.\n\nIf you think it's slightly inexplicable, to the point of outright derangement, for Russell Crowe to make two films about the same thing, with more or less the same title, where he pretty much wears the same costume, and the poster for each of them uses the same font, then you might have a point. This sort of thing just hasn't happened in recent memory.\n\nImagine if right after Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet starred in Dune, he rushed off and made another completely unrelated sci-fi movie about a worm-loving messiah figure called The Duning, or if Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt commemorated their last day of filming on the set of The Fall Guy by signing up for an exactly identical action comedy called Here Comes Mr Whoopsie.\n\nEven Nicolas Cage, in the midst of his prolific \"Look, I'll make any film you give me\" stage, didn't make two films as identical as The Exorcism and The Pope's Exorcist. Even when he made two different films about two different men who can both see slightly into the future and use their skill to stop two different ends of the world (Next and Knowing), he had the good sense to give a couple of years between the two.\n\nNot so Russell Crowe. No. At some point, we can safely assume that Russell Crowe put on a dog collar, held a crucifix, yelled at a demon and felt such a serene sense of calm wash over him that he decided this would be his entire career from now on.\n\nSure, Crowe is currently experiencing a Cage-like increased workrate, which means that two of his films and one of his TV shows were released between The Pope's Exorcist last year and The Exorcism this week. And, sure, the content of the films is a little different, in that one is about an exorcist and the other is about an actor who plays an exorcist and then gets possessed and then does an exorcism anyway. But still, what the hell happened?\n\nWell, let's not lay the blame entirely at Crowe's feet. Originally, The Exorcism wasn't called The Exorcism. When he signed up to star in it, all the way back in 2019, it went by The Georgetown Project. In fact, the film was shot in 2019, and probably would have been released much sooner had Covid not hobbled a round of reshoots. Post-production then took a long time to complete, to the point that it wasn't actually completed until January.\n\nIt wasn't until principal photography on The Exorcism had been wrapped for three years that Crowe signed up to star in The Pope's Exorcist. That film had a much smoother turnaround. Crowe joined the film in June 2022, filming began two months later and everything was wrapped up three months after that. And, by all accounts, it was an unexpected success. The Pope's Exorcist made its budget back four-and-a-half times over, and spent more than a week as the most-watched film on Netflix.\n\nSo, had it not been for Covid, there could have been four whole years between Russell Crowe's two exorcist films. Had that been the case, barely anyone would have noticed. And maybe, just maybe, Crowe is slightly a victim of his own success here. This is just a punt, but you get the feeling that The Exorcism has gone out of its way to ape the publicity material of The Pope's Exorcist because it wants to ride the latter's coat-tails a little. Maybe this is all just an unlucky coincidence.\n\nEither way, what's done is done. Whatever the circumstances that led to this event, it looks to all the world as if Russell Crowe wants to pump out a relentless stream of identical exorcism movies until the end of time. So now it's time for him to strike while the iron is hot. By my calculations, he has just 14 months to film and release the concluding part of what has the potential to be one of the weirdest unofficial trilogies of all time.

Sometimes those demons rear their ugly heads and nothing we do will keep them at bay. For actor Anthony \"Tony\" Miller (Russell Crowe; Gladiator) those demons have seemingly laid dormant for many years. However, when his daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins; Revolutionary Road) gets suspended from boarding school and returns home, tensions grow and old wounds begin to resurface. Compounding the issue, Tony, considered to be a \"risk\", is offered the lead role in a movie portraying a priest who has to perform an exorcism. He, and those around him, quickly discover that Tony's character isn't the only one entangled in an exorcism.\n\nLee was young when her mother got sick and eventually died of cancer. During that time, her famous father was sleeping around with other women and drinking heavily, doing irreparable harm to their relationship. Lee is not happy about being home and even less happy when her father lands a movie role and gets her a job on set as a production assistant so he can keep an eye on her but as Tony's behavior keeps becoming more and more bizarre, Lee finds herself looking after him instead. When it becomes apparent there is something more sinister at play, Lee consults with Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce; Fraiser), the priest consulting on the film set.\n\nWriters M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller (Queen of the South) make a movie within a movie with characters that seem to have dual roles to play some even going through their own exorcism as the movie progresses. Miller, who also directs The Exorcism, pays homage to his late father, actor Jason Miller (That Championship Season), in several ways. From naming the lead character Anthony Miller to making him portray a priest in the fictitious film, there are reminders of the elder Miller throughout the movie.\n\nThe cast is terrific, led expertly by Crowe. As this is his second foray at portraying a priest, Crowe seems to have the posture and attitude down pat. As Lee's estranged father, he is equally as good but his best moments are probably when he plays the possessed actor reliving past horrors going all the way back to his time as an alter boy in church. Simpkins matches Crowe's energy and the two have some memorable scenes together. Adam Goldberg (A Beautiful Mind) is also memorable but more for his character's unsympathetic words to Miller than anything else. Hyde Pierce is good as well, as is Sam Worthington (Avatar) even though they limited on-screen time.\n\nThe story is interesting and explores the characters' demons, many of which need to be excised. Tony has multiple demons that he can't seem to shake despite both Lee's and Father Conor's attempts to do so. Lee also needs to find a way to forgive her father and excise the hate she feels towards him while at the same time moving past her mother's death.\n\nThe Exorcism begins slowly and is a little choppy but picks up steam well before we hit the second act. That second act builds tension, both between Lee and Tony and between Tony and the Devil. Most of the \"horror\" comes in this second act well and looks as if it may climax to a chilling ending in act three. Unfortunately, all the build-up falls apart in the latter half of Act Three, making for a sloppy and mildly confusing ending.\n\nMix a strong cast with a unique premise and some gory elements and you should come up with a decent film. The Exorcism is unfortunately just that and less than the sum of its parts.", "source": {"uri": "flickdirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FlickDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolutionary Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boarding school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.

The anticipated prequel A Quiet Place: Day One is arriving at the end of the month, and July and August include exciting upcoming horror films including the critically acclaimed Longlegs, MaXXXine, Cuckoo, Trap, and Alien: Romulus. Arriving before any of those titles, however, is writer/director Joshua John Miller's The Exorcism, which is presently getting a notably mixed reaction from critics.\n\nIn the film (which has no relation to The Pope's Exorcist), Russell Crowe plays Anthony Miller - an actor who has signed on to star in a horror movie and finds himself slowly unraveling. While there is concern that there is substance abuse to blame for his behavior, the truth may actually be more in the supernatural realm. As you can probably tell, there is a bit of metatextuality at play here, but according to Emma Kiely from Collider, the comedic commentary and horror vibes don't properly play off of each other. She writes,\n\nWriting of FilmInk Australia, Dov Kornits doesn't express a whole lot of love for the work from Oscar-winner Russell Crowe. He says that there are a couple of \"serviceable\" scares in the movie,\" but there is a vibe from the star that it's not totally engaged with the material. The critics says,\n\nJennie Kermode of Eye For Film has a different take, and instead says that Russell Crowe is \"in his element,\" and that the movie has him confronting some of his own on-set conflicts from the past. The critique also notes that Joshua John Miller is the son of Jason Miller a.k.a. Father Karras from William Friedkin's The Exorcist, and that history informs the filmmakers work:\n\nDigital Media Talkies critic Pramit Chatterjee is also in the pro-The Exorcism camp, giving the film 3 1/2 stars out of five. The writer says that they went into the movie expecting it to be a comedy, but they were surprised to discover \"a serious meditation on the evil that exists within churches.\"\n\nPeter Gray of The AU Review agrees that there is some depth to the work, but that it doesn't land as a \"cohesive production, despite its promising ingredients.\" It tries to do too much and fails to achieve what it attempts in the 93 minute runtime, according to Gray:\n\nAlso starring Ryan Simpkins, Sam Worthington, Chloe Bailey, Adam Goldberg, and David Hyde Pierce, The Exorcism is arriving in theaters this Friday, June 21.

All films about demonic possession seem to speak its twisted language, and its influence becomes even harder to ignore in The Exorcism, a film whose title is just one letter removed. The new Russell Crowe-starring horror film also happens to be about a pseudo-remake of Friedkin's classic, and is even directed by Joshua John Miller, the son of actor Jason Miller, who played Father Karras in the landmark original.\n\nHowever, Miller -- who co-wrote the script with romantic partner M.A. Fortin -- isn't eager to shy away from comparisons. In fact, his experiences watching his dad be violently tossed around on set appear to have left an indelible mark, to the point that The Exorcism is entirely about a child witnessing their father lose himself to a similar role.\n\nThe horror-drama is situated firmly in the supernatural and the self-reflexive, opening with the demonic death of an actor on a constructed sound stage. Not long after, Russell Crowe's washed-up, widowered character actor Anthony Miller -- note the last name -- is called in to audition as a replacement, and wins the role because of his troubled past.\n\nAdam Goldberg plays Anthony's ruthless unnamed director, who probes at his pain and insecurities to get a better performance out of him, on a film dubbed \"The Georgetown Project.\" It's a working title that alludes to The Exorcist's setting, and heavily implies it to be a remake. It has all the hallmarks of typical exorcism movies, from a scarred child writhing around in her bed (Chloe Bailey), to a handsome priest commanding a demon to take a hike (Sam Worthington). Even outside the context of Miller's connection to the original, the premise feels tongue-in-cheek: you can scarcely make an exorcism movie without feeling like a Friedkin knock-off, so why pretend otherwise?\n\nWhat makes Anthony's participation especially intriguing is his relationship to Catholic imagery. He was once publicly mentioned as a victim of priesthood abuse, and his alcohol and drug problems seem to have stemmed from childhood incidents. Despite the kind words of the film's Catholicism consultant, Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce), Anthony's suppressed emotions come rushing to the fore when he's hired to embody a priest wrestling with his faith. This is a part of himself Anthony has long buried and left behind, but accessing it comes at a particularly tricky time, since the production coincides with his estranged daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins) returning home after being expelled from college.\n\nAnthony gets Lee a job on set, but as the shoot goes on, she's forced to watch him slowly tumble down an emotional rabbit hole, as he backslides into concerning behavior that rides the line between addiction and something ghostly. It's during these more mysterious scenes -- when The Exorcism allows elements of doubt to creep in -- that it has the most soul, allowing horror tropes and hallmarks to exacerbate intimate personal demons, rather than standing in as fluid, distant metaphors.\n\nThe film makes full use of the language of method acting, not in the reductive \"staying in character at all times\" sense, but the traditional notion of emotional recall and playing on one's experiences. When Anthony goes to a deep, dark place within his memories -- usually depicted as fleeting but powerful flashes -- he accesses the raw vulnerability his character needs, but does real spiritual damage to himself as well. This manifests in the form of a subtle darkness that consumes his eyes (another image typical of Hollywood horror), but no one else seems to notice. Either they don't see it -- it works perfectly well as a projection of his psyche -- or they refuse to recognize the personal hell Anthony is putting himself through.\n\nImages that recur in possession films, and those that were made iconic by The Exorcist, appear in new permutations as embodiments of Anthony's relapse into alcoholism. He loses control of bodily function when he blacks out, and \"becomes\" a worse, more aggressive, more confrontational person, blurring the line between possession and intoxication. All the while, as the film plays coy about personal-versus-literal demons, Crowe delivers a masterfully committed performance -- much of it in close up -- during which it's hard not get pulled into his orbit, and connect with him spiritually.\n\nAt one point, Goldberg's character pompously refers to The Georgetown Project as a psychological drama wrapped in horror packaging, which seems to poke fun at the self-importance of modern \"prestige horror.\" However, Crowe really is tuned into something wholly dramatic and heart-rending, even when the movie eventually slips too far into traditional horror territory and loses steam. It becomes that which it's satirizing, and it's not a particularly effective version of it either, but there isn't a single moment when Crowe isn't utterly convincing. Notably, The Exorcism is the second recent exorcist movie starring Crowe. The other was the raucously silly The Pope's Exorcist, which it was shot well before in 2019, and while the two have little in common outside of Crowe, what they do share is his magnetic presence (this time, with a flimsy American accent, rather than Italian).\n\nAnthony's relationship to his daughter remains central, though it's hard to avoid feeling like some element of its horror-drama might've been left on the table. Lee has a girlfriend and his played by a nonbinary actor, and while the movie's casual queerness is a step in the right direction of the optics of inclusion, it also represents a missed opportunity, when it comes to placing Lee's queerness in direct confrontation with the movie's strongly Catholic symbols and themes. Miller, a gay director, is certainly free to place as much or as little of his experience on screen as he sees fit, but the film only lightly touches on Anthony's feelings towards his daughter being a lesbian. While this happens at a charged moment, it amounts to very little by way of discomfort or dramatic evolution. Something darker and uglier, meanwhile, would've been a perfect fit for the movie's bleak, frigid color palette, which imbues it with a sense of nihilism. It's evocatively shot, but it's rarely provocative, emotionally or thematically, in part because it seems eager to speed along to its conclusion.\n\nThis is another major road bump too. Just when it seems like the film is getting too lethargic with its exorcism shtick, it takes what appears to be a major left turn. However, it also very quickly doubles back -- a jarring u-turn that feels like the product of reshoots, or distinct lack thereof -- because it soon arrives at its climax without any indication of how it actually got there, physically or emotionally.\n\nWatching Crowe ham his way through scenes of guilt and anguish is deliciously enjoyable. He's consistently the best thing about movies that would otherwise be dismissed as direct-to-video shlock, because he's a prestige star no matter what kind of film he's in. However, there's only so much The Exorcism can actually accomplish with its subversions before it embraces the mundane and overly-familiar, rather than transcending it.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Karras", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damien Karras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

Among them is a tendency to let powerful people get away with unconscionable behavior. In that insidious overlap, director Joshua John Miller finds the heart of \"The Exorcism,\" an ambitious social commentary that commingles Hollywood's penchant for wrongdoing with the abuses of the Vatican for a unique portrait of an actor unraveled.\n\nOn the one hand, it's a mediocre genre movie with a title as mundane as it is misleading. (If you're inquiring about the other supernatural possession flick starring Russell Crowe, that's actually \"The Pope's Exorcist,\" which came out last year and, yes, sucks.) On the other hand, even as a muddy character study making only the weakest attempts to scare, \"The Exorcis-m\" is still a bigger treat for fans of \"The Exorcis-t\" than its recent flop sequel, \"The Exorcist: Believer.\"\n\nWhy? In a year that's already seen two major horror movies competing for the title of Best Virgin Nun to Give Birth to the Antichrist, Miller and co-writer M.A. Fortin have miraculously managed to achieve a kind of original sin. Caught somewhere between the #MeToo-era \"The Assistant\" and your run-of-the-mill \"The Conjuring\" nonsense, this atypical drama makes clever critique of two institutions -- and lets the toxic spirit that binds them hang in the air like a cinematic sign of the cross. It's imperfect and awkward with a last act that swan dives straight into pavement. Still, \"The Exorcism\" is nothing if not encouraging in its core creativity.\n\nA Miramax and Outerbanks Entertainment release, this spiritual companion to William Friedkin's horror masterpiece from 1973 is known to genre aficionados primarily because of its director's dad, Jason Miller. The late actor played Father Damien Karras in the original film, earning his only Academy Award nomination for the part. The meta new movie opens on a multi-level suburban house, painstakingly recreated on a soundstage for a remake of something they're calling \"The Georgetown Project.\" (Hello to you too, the legal team at Universal.) Those especially well-versed in the history of Friedkin's supposedly \"cursed\" production -- heavily documented and connected to at least nine cast and crew deaths over the years -- will appreciate the establishing shot of \"The Exorcism\" as an homage to the tortured world in which Miller's father worked.\n\nAt the outset of the film within a film, an unnamed actor playing the Father Karras role (Adrian Pasdar) is seen alone. He's practicing his mysterious briefcase entrance and the stairway ascent to the possessed girl's bedroom when suddenly something supernatural seems to rush the set to kill him. With no witnesses, the would-be scream king's untimely demise is ruled a suicide, and the pastoral posting for \"Father Arlington\" (sure!) needs filling on the call sheet soon after.\n\nEnter Russell Crowe as Tony, a washed-up '80s action star and recovering alcoholic cast against type by the douchey director Peter (Adam Goldberg). In the first of many disquieting method acting moments, the bearded film bro suspiciously suggests his ex-Catholic actor pray during his audition... and likes it a little too much when he does.\n\nWith a spotty track record in the public eye and his newly un-estranged daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins) not letting him forget it, Tony may be battling demons, but he's no priest. The death of the former A-lister's wife a few years back left the actor not just riddled with guilt over his tragic romance and absentee parenting, but he's also struggling to maintain the faith needed to show up for his daughter and the professional comeback he thinks he needs to make now.\n\n\"You're irredeemable,\" the director caricature hisses at Crowe in an early scene that puts the \"Gladiator\" star on the wrong end of a \"Whiplash\" vignette. Ostensibly, the tough love moment is an ill-advised attempt by Peter to capture something \"real\" for his IP cash-grab, but it's also a reflection of the controversial legacy left behind by Friedkin's sometimes alarming behaviors. The filmmaker reportedly fired guns inside and at will while shooting \"The Exorcist\" -- just to keep his performers on their toes. Here, the fictional Peter isn't physically abusive to Tony, but he's manipulative and might as well be saying, \"You're replaceable!\" to a man already on the brink. Crowe meets the moment with all the kaleidoscopic vulnerability that kid actor Linda Blair brought to Regan MacNeil more than 50 years ago, stress rippling across Tony's face like a tentacle busting through skin even as the VFX fails to impress.\n\nWith Crowe and Simpkins as rock-solid scene partners, the film's most important role reversal sees Lee step into the part of a maternal Ellen Burstyn figure for her troubled dad. Working as a production assistant on \"The Georgetown Project\" by day and witnessing the effects of Tony's ongoing breakdown by night, the 16-year-old girl falls victim to an inverted parent-child relationship evocative of the incongruences seen in real domestic neglect. As Tony begins sleepwalking through dark hallways, speaking in tongues, and rejecting his medication at home, two questions play out in parallel for Lee: Is this man really possessed by a demon? And if not, what triggered his apocalyptic relapse?\n\nOn the confused fringes, on-set Catholic consultant for the movie Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce, hugely wasted) offers Lee spiritual guidance and practical advice. Simultaneously, love interest Blake (Chloe Bailey, charming) makes the case that the movie itself has summoned an evil presence that's now inside Tony. To speed things along, there's also supporting actor Joe (Sam Worthington), waiting in the wings to take over his competition's character at a moment's notice. With painful cliches -- LOUD NOISES! FLASHY LIGHTS! MORE LOUD NOISES! -- appearing where inventive supernatural imagery should be, \"The Exorcism\" is at its most clumsy when resolving these storylines near the climax. Suffice to say, attempting to end a delicate horror puzzle with a brutally unsubtle action sequence is the filmmaking equivalent of treating a demon child via gun.\n\nAlthough this otherwise distinctive work might betray itself as an ill-informed imitator of terror in the end, Miller and Fortin's shared imagination pulls off some miraculous tricks with their source material. It's got plot holes for stigmata and too many ideas to proselytize anyone toward the creepy Catholic subgenre -- but for this unrepeatable artistic consideration, the nerdy backdrop of legacy horror is an ideal altar.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_foreman@indiewire.com", "name": "Alison Foreman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Karras", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damien Karras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outerbanks_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outerbanks Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Fortin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPersonally, I've derived great joy from the fact Russell Crowe has played an exorcist twice in the past year. It's unpredictable and without the calculated air of an actor attempting to renegotiate their public image. Maybe you can draw a direct, logical line between the heartthrob in the leather skirt in Gladiator, through to the slightly beaten down but no less cool detective of The Nice Guys, and on to this new image of him wielding a crucifix and muttering \"in nomine patris\" while a child levitates over a bed. Maybe you can't.\n\nBut the thing with Crowe is that he commits, whatever the circumstances. There wasn't a single breath of hesitation in his Italian-accented, scooter-riding priest in The Pope's Exorcist, even in the face of all that Catholic camp. A visiting demon claims he's everyone's worst nightmare. Crowe's character, in full deadpan, shoots back: \"My worst nightmare is France winning the World Cup.\"\n\nHis new film, The Exorcism, shares almost no DNA with The Pope's Exorcist. This is satanic horror played with an almost entirely straight face, its aspirations dialled up from B-movie to William Friedkin's The Exorcist. It's directed and co-written by Joshua John Miller, whose father Jason Miller played Father Damien Karras in The Exorcist (and, later, The Exorcist III). And it's inspired, in part, by the rumours that the set of Friedkin's film was cursed, following a destructive fire, nine deaths, and multiple injuries.\n\nCrowe plays Anthony Miller, an actor recently discharged from rehab, and now on a quest for career resuscitation and spiritual absolution by playing the Max von Sydow role in what is a thinly veiled remake of The Exorcist. Yet, Anthony arrives with the devil already on his back - Miller, who co-wrote the script with his partner and collaborator MA Fortin, heavily implies that Anthony's issues with addiction stem from sexual abuse by a priest in his childhood. And when he's repeatedly triggered by a narcissist director (Adam Goldberg) who whispers his worst memories back in his ear, Anthony finds himself pushed in frightening, distinctly demonic directions.\n\nThere's a question, established early on in The Exorcism, of whether Anthony's behaviour (a lot of blankly standing around and muttering in Latin) is really the work of the ancient sacrificial deity Moloch, or if it's his religious trauma and interconnected addiction struggles violently bursting back to life. There's something painfully familiar in the eyes of his estranged child, Lee (Ryan Simpkins), who's returned home from school after getting kicked out on thematically significant charges. And Crowe sells every inch of a man whose skin is puckered with emotional wounds, but their causes buried deep.\n\nThere's a natural eeriness to the cold, dead, dark spaces of the sound stage, and one particular kill that's unexpected and nasty. But The Exorcism collapses in on itself by the time it reaches its climactic demon expulsion, and it struggles to resolve the cruelty of Anthony's past with the kindly guidance of the film-within-the-film's Catholic advisor, Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce, so disarmingly gentle that it reminds us why he was simply too good for the Frasier reboot). It hints at (but never confirms) a revelation that would fundamentally change the film's outlook on the church. The film may be ideologically confusing, but Crowe never falters.

Unlike most of us, though, his demons appear to be literal.\n\nConsider: Last year, he starred in the horror-thriller \"The Pope's Exorcist.\" Now, this Friday, he stars in the similarly themed but unimaginatively titled \"The Exorcism.\"\n\nThat's right. Back-to-back exorcism projects -- with a \"Pope's Exorcist\" sequel (and possibly two) reportedly in the works.\n\nTalk about a man possessed.\n\nIn truth, the consecutive releases are more a scheduling quirk rather than a sign that Crowe is suffering a crisis of faith. The two films were shot three years apart, with Crowe taking on four non-exorcism projects (by my count) between them.\n\nStill, it's a stark illustration of the fascination Hollywood has with demonic possessions, even now, 51 years after William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" lodged itself in our collective psyche and launched what would become a new genre.\n\nFriedkin's game-changer\n\nHelping \"The Exorcism\" stand out from the pack is an intriguing origin story that can be traced to Friedkin's 1973 game-changer. Crowe's imposing presence, with his singular blend of pathos and menace, is also an undeniable asset.\n\nAt the same time, writer-director Joshua John Miller's film -- which was shot four years ago, before the COVID-19 pandemic upended everything -- feels as though it has been edited and reedited to within an inch of its life.\n\nIn this case, the result is a handsomely shot but entirely humorless film haunted by a disjointed narrative, a raft of unexplained questions and a cast of largely unsympathetic characters.\n\nThe whole project got its start with Friedkin's \"Exorcist,\" in which Miller's real-life father, Jason Miller, memorably played a doomed priest. For years later, the elder Miller regaled him and others with stories from Friedkin's famously \"cursed\" production.\n\nThat gave the younger Miller an idea. What if somebody made a movie about a production that really was cursed -- or, in this case, possessed?\n\nPriests and actors\n\nTo turn the genre even further on its head, the malevolent forces at work wouldn't target the innocent young women who always bear the brunt of things in such movies. Rather, they would target the actors portraying the priests dispatched to send them back to the fiery pit from whence they came.\n\nIn this case, Crowe plays just such an actor, but he's a particularly vulnerable one.\n\nStruggling under the weight of grief, guilt and addiction, he is desperately in need of a hit to revive his flagging career. The sudden reappearance in his life of his resentful teenage daughter (Ryan Simpkins) doesn't help matters.\n\nWhen he begins acting strangely on set, everyone assumes he has relapsed. But it eventually becomes evident there might be something supernatural going on.\n\nHonestly, that's not a bad foundation for a horror movie. Unfortunately, there's just too much missing from the film to make it feel like a complete, coherent vision.\n\nTo be clear, we're not talking about the minor sloppiness that crops up here and there, such as the magical phone that inexplicably survives after being dropped from two or three stories up, or the teapot that makes pouring sounds after it has stopped pouring.\n\nProblems with the plot\n\nWe're talking bigger questions. Perhaps most foundational: Whose is the real lead character here? Crowe's or Simpkins'? Arguments can be made for both.\n\nEqually problematic is the fact that, while we eventually learn the name of the demon doing the possessing, there's never any explanation for where it came from or what it wants.\n\nThen there's the character played by Sam Worthington, whose presence suggests some drastic rewriting given how weirdly brief -- and unnecessary -- his involvement is.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the decision to artificially age David Hyde Pierce, playing a priest hired as a consultant for the movie-within-a-movie.\n\nAny one or two of those would be bad enough. But all of them existing side by side?\n\nWhat possessed them?\n\nMike Scott can be reached at moviegoermike@gmail.com.\n\n************************\n\nTHE EXORCISM\n\n2 stars, out of 4\n\nCAST: Crowe, Ryan Simpkins, Chloe Bailey, David Hyde Pierce, Adam Goldberg, Sam Worthington.\n\nDIRECTOR: Joshua John Miller.\n\nRATED: R, for language, some violent content, sexual references and brief drug use.\n\nRUNNING TIME: 1 hour 32 minutes.\n\nWHEN AND WHERE: Opens Friday (June 21) at Elmwood Palace, Westbank Palace, Kenner Grand, Covington Movie Tavern, Regal Covington.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_scott@nola.com", "name": "Mike Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope's_Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pope's Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_possession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit possession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Worthington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/23/1232f986-2caf-11ef-a2cc-e3290566c402/66703ca6c4343.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664509", "eventUri": "eng-9664509", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 4391, "textEnd": 4398}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Adam Goldberg, known for his intense roles, shines as a hotheaded director pushing actor Russell Crowe to his limits. Goldberg's meta experience as a director influenced his portrayal, creating an intense dynamic with Crowe on set.\n\nIf you need a quick jump-scare fix, exorcism movies are usually a safe bet. Luckily, the subgenre remains red-hot - and not just because the Exorcist franchise lives on. A new Russell Crowe starrer, in theaters now, not only features a stellar cast, including beloved character actor Adam Goldberg, but it also takes the possession concept a step further by basing the narrative in a movie-within-a-movie setting. Yes, Crowe has starred in multiple exorcism-centered projects already at this point, but here he's playing, interestingly enough, a washed-up actor playing the role of an exorcist - at first. And who better than Goldberg (Saving Private Ryan, Dazed and Confused) to play the hotheaded and misogynistic director to try and bully Crowe's character into a half-decent performance for the possession movie he's trying to pull off?\n\nTalk about meta, especially since Goldberg is a talented director in real life. We recently caught up with him during The Exorcism junket to learn more about what it was like putting on the director's hat -- as a fictional character -- and reuniting with Crowe all these years later, following their work together in A Beautiful Mind.\n\nGoldberg Says Directing Is 'Like Being a Parent' The Exorcism (2024) R\n\nRelease Date June 7, 2024 Director Joshua John Miller , M.A. Fortin Cast Russell Crowe , Ryan Simpkins , Chloe Bailey , Sam Worthington , Adam Goldberg , David Hyde Pierce Runtime 93 Minutes\n\nAll it takes is a quick on-screen intro to Goldberg's character, Peter, to know the kind of terrible director he'd be to work with in this fictional universe The Exorcism occupies. \"It was like an opportunity to sort of be the a**h***... not that I want to be,\" he told MovieWeb. \"But I always say that, like, directing is really a lot like being a parent, which I couldn't have known before I had kids. And I realize now it's almost identical. And, of course, yeah, my character in this movie is just like the world's worst dad... We have two kids [in real life], and they never want the same thing at the same time. And oh gosh, I cannot tell you how much that reminds me of directing.\"\n\nRelated Mike Flanagan Promises His Exorcist Movie Will Be 'Really Scary'\n\nThe director of the new Exorcist film is already sharing some information about the new project, and unlike Believer, this one promises to be scary.\n\nGoldberg has directed several films of his own in real life, such as No Way Jose back in 2015, so the meta element of The Exorcism shines through in more ways than one. \"My familiarity with movie sets, film sets, was super helpful,\" he said. \"There's no doubt about it, like, just in terms of little details and kind of ad libs and things like that. One of my real pet peeves about films-about-films is how often they just get the minutiae wrong, and it really throws me somehow. And when they're like, [cue cheesy voice] \"Rolling! Action! Print! Lunch!\" you know? That just drives me insane. So just keeping it, like, kind of as real as you could possibly keep it... I think my experience on set, whether as an actor or as a director, whatever, was probably helpful.\"\n\nActing With Crowe: Like 'Amazing Tennis' Close\n\nThe way Goldberg's Peter treats Crowe's troubled Anthony persona is often hard to watch, the way in which this in-your-face director will seemingly stop at nothing to get the dark performance he needs. Says Goldberg:\n\n\"Whether we want to admit it or not, we all possess these characteristics, and it's a question of whether or not you're going to sort of take the lid off of them for a particular role. And this was an opportunity to sort of really tap into my egoism... I remember people on the set constantly saying to me, like, 'Oh my God, I know that guy. I know that guy!' So many people, because these are all crew members who no doubt have probably been yelled at more than me just because of the way that just sort of hierarchy of filmmaking works. But arguably, I've seen more actors act the way that this director did.\"\n\nPerhaps Goldberg's intensity alongside Crowe in The Exorcism is so natural because they acted alongside each other before: over two decades ago in Crowe's Oscar-winning A Beautiful Mind. \"I remember the same thing, which was that, on the one hand, your pals with him, you're hanging out with him, you're talking with him,\" said Goldberg, thinking about both experiences.\n\nRelated Horror Icons Barbara Crampton & Lin Shaye to Headline The Possession at Gladstone Manor\n\nThe two icons of horror will share the screen in director K. Asher Levin's new horror film, which is expected to wrap filming later this month.\n\n\"It's like, you think of someone like Russell - or I thought of someone like Russell - as sort of what what we're doing in the film, which is this kind of Stanislavski sort of method, where you're mining the very depths of your soul...

Check These Spine Chilling Exorcism Movies On Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar, JioCinema", "body": "Exorcism Movies On OTT: With the release of Russell Crowe's upcoming film The Exorcism approaching, horror enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating a spine-chilling experience. Before stepping into theaters to witness Crowe's portrayal of demonic possession, immerse yourself in the unsettling world of exorcism with these five must-watch classics. Each film stands as a masterpiece, offering nuanced and gripping narratives that define the exorcism horror genre. Prepare to heighten your senses and embrace the ultimate fright night -- these movies promise to leave a lasting impression, lingering long after the credits roll.\n\nNo discussion of exorcism movies would be complete without mentioning the iconic classic 'The Exorcist,' directed by William Friedkin and based on William Peter Blatty's novel. The film chronicles the terrifying ordeal of a young girl, Regan, who becomes possessed by a demonic entity, and the desperate efforts of two priests to save her soul. Renowned for its groundbreaking special effects and chilling scenes, The Exorcist set the benchmark for all exorcism films that followed, cementing its status as essential viewing for horror aficionados. Interestingly, Linda Blair, who portrayed Regan, faced death threats post-release due to the film's controversial nature, prompting Warner Bros. to provide her with security. Additionally, the film's eerie \"spider walk\" scene, originally excluded from the initial release, was later added in the 2000 re-release, further adding to its mystique and impact.\n\nDirected by Scott Derrickson, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a gripping courtroom drama infused with horror, inspired by true events. The film delves into the tragic and mysterious case of a young woman named Emily Rose who undergoes an exorcism. What sets this movie apart is its unique blend of legal proceedings and supernatural horror, offering a compelling narrative that explores themes of demonic possession and the complexities of faith. Based loosely on the real-life story of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who endured 67 exorcisms and died in 1976, the film delves into unsettling phenomena both on and off-screen. Jennifer Carpenter, who portrayed Emily Rose, reportedly encountered eerie occurrences during filming, such as her radio inexplicably turning on and off by itself, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the production's mystique.\n\nFrom the visionary mind of modern horror maestro James Wan, \"The Conjuring\" unfolds a chilling narrative inspired by the real-life investigations of paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren. Set against the backdrop of a Rhode Island farmhouse plagued by sinister occurrences, the film follows the Warrens as they confront a malevolent entity terrorizing a family. What sets \"The Conjuring\" apart is its ability to deliver spine-tingling scares and an authentic atmosphere, setting a new standard in the horror genre with genuine frights and a compelling storyline. Adding to its authenticity, the real Lorraine Warren served as a consultant for the film and even made a cameo appearance, while the Perron family, whose haunting forms the basis of the story, visited the set to share their firsthand experiences with the cast and crew.\n\nStarring Anthony Hopkins, The Rite explores the realm of exorcism through the perspective of a skeptical seminary student dispatched to the Vatican to learn about exorcism rites. Inspired by true events, this film provides an in-depth look at the rituals and realities of exorcism, with Hopkins delivering an exceptionally haunting performance. Based on Matt Baglio's book 'The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist,' which chronicles real-life exorcism training, the film's authenticity is further bolstered by director Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m's efforts, including visits to the Vatican to consult with actual exorcists during production.\n\nKeanu Reeves stars as John Constantine in this supernatural thriller, portraying a demon hunter who can perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true forms. Directed by Francis Lawrence, \"Constantine\" combines horror, action, and the occult to offer a unique take on the eternal struggle between good and evil. The film's dark, atmospheric visuals and intense storyline make it a standout in the exorcism genre. Notably, the character of John Constantine was originally a blonde British man in the \"Hellblazer\" comic series, but Keanu Reeves' portrayal gave the character a fresh twist. Additionally, the film's depiction of Hell was inspired by nuclear bomb test footage, adding to its eerie and distinctive visual style.\n\nStep into the chilling world of The Exorcism, where Academy Award-winner Russell Crowe stars as Anthony Miller, a troubled actor spiraling into darkness. While working on a supernatural horror film, Anthony's estranged daughter Lee, played by Ryan Simpkins, grows increasingly worried. Is her father succumbing to his old demons, or is something far more sinister at play? With a stellar cast including Sam Worthington, Chloe Bailey, Adam Goldberg, and David Hyde Pierce, The Exorcism promises an unforgettable experience. Russell Crowe returns to the exorcism genre, bringing his intense performance style to this chilling new story. Written and directed by Joshua John Miller, son of the late Jason Miller known for his iconic role in the 1973 classic The Exorcist, the film is inspired by tales of his father's experiences. Joshua weaves a narrative that blurs the lines between reality and fiction, echoing the legacy of horror cinema. Expect a film within a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, nodding to the original The Exorcist while delivering a fresh, spine-tingling story.\n\nALSO READ: Darshan Case: Police Accuses

After two years lost to alcoholism and the death of his wife from cancer, this faded star has landed a key supporting role in a carbon copy (no one uses the word \"reboot\") of William Friedkin's The Exorcist.\n\nThe film-in-progress that will co-star Crowe's character (\"The Georgetown Project\") threatens us mainly with murk and dissatisfaction. The same, alas, is true of The Exorcism itself.\n\nScrutinise the surname of director Joshua John Miller, and yet further layers of self-referentiality announce themselves. He's the son of Jason Miller, who was Father Damien in Friedkin's film. Crowe's character is nudgingly named \"Anthony Miller\" - which is actually confusing, because in both age and the scale of his part, he seems a closer fit to Max von Sydow.\n\nPuzzling out the finer details here won't help us much, anyway. This is masturbatory pseudo-horror, with about 20 scattered minutes of even attempted scares. It remains stubbornly confounding - a rough draft with hints of winking wit.\n\nIt does start with a promising notion. The original actor earmarked for Crowe's part meets a sticky end, when he walks around the set one night rehearsing his lines, and demonic forces whip up a demise that could pass for suicide. Incompetently edited as it is, the hook works: why would the Devil want Crowe's character to get this part instead?\n\n\"To possess him\" turns out to be the answer. Before he starts looking distinctly mouldy and the opaque contact lenses go in, we trudge through a rapprochement with his daughter (Ryan Simpkins) and a few amusing scenes with the director (a bilious Adam Goldberg) who regrets hiring him. A real-life priest (David Hyde Pierce) is the on-set consultant, unaware that Anthony was abused as an altar boy, which makes his attitude to the collar unsurprisingly queasy.\n\nSemi-intriguing as this may all be, it's still headed to a formulaic showdown in an upstairs bedroom, with all the usual incantations and ramped-up sound design on a tight budget. It's priest vs unpriest, this time, with the demon pinging between them. The stakes are just feeble, for all Crowe's perfectly solid efforts, and the default level of dinge in the film saps all excitement away.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_robey@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Tim Robey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope's_Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pope's Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgetown_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Georgetown Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Damien", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Father Damien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surname"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Sydow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max von Sydow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incantation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Altar server"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VvKjHw3pGtKLWd54YupD.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/390f5d765cc87a9c20ab138d70e77b51", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664509", "eventUri": "eng-9664509", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Writer-director Miller is the son of Jason Miller, who played Father Karras in William Friedkin's 1973 classic The Exorcist, and his film clearly references this heritage and all the lore that surrounds the Freidkin movie.\n\nThe story begins in intriguing fashion, with a man reciting his lines from a screenplay in what first appears to be an empty house. In fact, it's a movie set and he's the actor due to play the priest in a new horror feature with the working title The Georgetown Project (Georgetown was the setting for the original Exorcist). But just minutes into the film, the horror begins and he dies in grisly circumstances. The director, Peter (Adam Goldberg), must find a replacement - fast.\n\nHe turns to troubled actor Tony Miller (Russell Crowe). Tony is a recovering alcoholic and a bit of a shambling wreck. He also has a troubled relationship with the priesthood: he was once a choir boy, but it's been 40 years since his last communion - and he is still traumatised by his experiences at the hands of an abusive priest. His wife, whom we learn he treated very badly, has died of cancer, and his rebellious teenage daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins) despises him. Meanwhile, his career has imploded and everyone is very surprised when he lands such an important role.\n\nCrowe excels at playing misfits like this. The Oscar-winning Gladiator star has had an erratic time on screen of late (he was very hammy in last year's The Pope's Exorcist) but the old charisma hasn't deserted him. Wheels are turning within wheels here: he's portraying an actor who, at first, can't give a convincing performance because he is too fearful of embracing the darkness he knows is lurking within him. \"I need truth,\" the director yells at him, but Tony is simply going through the motions because it would be far too terrifying to do anything else.\n\nAlso on set as an expert consultant is Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce), a priest/psychiatrist who turns out to have first-hand experience of the dark side.\n\nThe script has plenty of mordant, ironic humour. Miller is playing with the idea that 70s horror movies like The Exorcist and The Omen were cursed and that bad things were bound to happen to anyone involved in making them. Goldberg portrays the director in enjoyably tongue-in-cheek fashion, as a hard-driving megalomaniac who tries to steamroller his actors into giving him the performances he wants. (Myth has it that this was exactly what the late Freidkin was like on the original Exorcist set).\n\nEarly on, the horror elements are downplayed and the film seems to be shaping up as a closely focused character drama about a desperate father's attempts to reconnect with his daughter and to make amends for all the hurt he has caused.\n\nAs production continues, Tony becomes more and more unhinged: he's drinking again, having violent mood swings and isn't taking his pills, his skin turns to a sweaty grey, and the director is looking to fire him. The devil, it turns out, is trying to possess Tony's soul and he seems powerless to keep it at bay.\n\nIt's at this point, though, that the film itself begins to unravel. What starts as an absorbing psychological study becomes an overwrought exercise in shock tactics. Crowe's complex, multi-layered performance becomes ever cruder and broader.\n\nThe final-reel stand-off between good and evil is very contrived - and far less frightening than you expect it to be. We see characters possessed by the evil one banging their heads, speaking in gravelly, Dalek-like tones, falling out of windows, swearing obscenely and trying to throttle those closest to them. Crucifixes burn through skin, onlookers desperately pray and invoke the names of the saints to keep the dark forces at bay, and plot strands - for instance the burgeoning relationship between Lee and the film's co-star Blake (Chloe Bailey) are ignored.\n\nMiller shot the movie before the pandemic. It has taken several years to reach cinemas and its botched ending suggests that it has been tinkered with extensively by many hands. It turns into just another dispiriting pastiche of the original Exorcist - but sadly without its intelligence or its malevolent sense of dread.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Karras", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damien Karras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgetown_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Georgetown Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working title"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastiche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope's_Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Pope's Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omen_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Omen (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eucharist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Bailey"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEI_209105341.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C903px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664509", "eventUri": "eng-9664509", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Notably, there's no indication that the next chapter will attempt a remake of The Exorcist. After all, William Friedkin's 1973 original, adapted by William Peter Blatty from his novel, stands as one of the most iconic horror films ever made; it won two Academy Awards out of ten nominations and essentially reinvented the genre.\n\nThis reluctance to reinterpret a widely revered classic is partly what makes Joshua John Miller's approach to the original so intriguing. As the son of the late Jason Miller, who played Father Damien Karras in Friedkin's film, the younger Miller heard plenty about the accidents and deaths associated with the movie. Transforming some of that \"cursed\" reputation into The Exorcism with a film-within-a-film structure, Miller endeavors to offer a contemporary take on both The Exorcist and the fundamental nature of evil, perhaps a tall order considering contemporary audiences' familiarity with demonic possession storylines.\n\nGiven that it's intended in part as a tribute to his father, naturally the film required a character named \"Miller.\" Attempting to make a comeback after a descent into drug and alcohol addiction almost destroys his acting career, Tony Miller (Russell Crowe) lands a role in The Georgetown Project, clearly a remake of The Exorcist -- although the 1973 film is never mentioned by name.\n\nDespite a shaky audition, it's Tony's tortured personal history that convinces demanding director Peter (Adam Goldberg) that he possesses sufficient gravitas for the part. Tony's defiant daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins), who recently returned home after getting suspended from private school, remains unimpressed, even after he gets her hired as a production assistant.\n\nPlaying Catholic priest Father Arlington in the film-within-the-film, Tony is the ostensible star but he experiences debilitating insecurity from the first day of shooting. Reluctantly tasked with investigating an apparent case of demonic possession that has ensnared a young woman (Chloe Bailey) in the clutches of a relentless demon, Arlington struggles to confront the beast, even as Miller searches for appropriate reference points to anchor his character.\n\nGentle guidance comes from on-set consulting cleric Father Conor (David Hyde Pierce), who helps Tony initially find his footing, although he's constantly undermined by Peter's insidious attempts to coax him toward a more authentic performance that mines his abundant private pain.\n\nRelying primarily on low-light locations for the sets of the production stage and Tony's apartment, the film features few exteriors, contributing to a sense of entrapment and dread for both the characters and the audience. In this oppressive setting, Tony's self-doubts gradually take over, unsettling both his performance and his mental health.\n\nAlthough Lee thinks her dad's increasingly concerning behavior -- including sleepwalking, unexplained physical ailments and even spontaneously mumbling in Latin -- could be due to him skipping his meds, she eventually grasps that there may be something more sinister afflicting Tony as he attempts to embody the doomed clergyman.\n\nDirector Miller and co-writer M.A. Fortin effectively deployed a similarly meta approach with their script for 2015's entertainingly offbeat horror-comedy The Final Girls, while the influence of producer and collaborator Kevin Williamson, creator of the Scream franchise, is also evident in the film's self-regarding perspective.\n\nThe filmmakers' slow-burn approach to building tension proves intriguing at first, as Tony attempts to come to grips with Arlington's reluctance to become involved with the victim and her mother. Like many a demonic thriller though, the actual mechanism of Tony's possession remains somewhat vague, perhaps attributable to an earlier tragedy on the production that left some malevolent force lingering on the set awaiting a new victim.\n\nTony also provides some clues to his complicated emotional history that may point to his susceptibility to evil, revealing his troubled memories about serving as an altar boy, as well as his unbearable guilt from effectively abandoning Lee and her mother after the latter developed cancer.\n\nSam Worthington doesn't get much mileage out of his role as Joe, the actor who plays Arlington's clerical colleague, but Pierce impresses as the sympathetic and supportive Father Conor, particularly once he's confronted by evil incarnate in the form of the fully possessed Arlington.\n\nTaken together though, the script's rather shaky foundations and Crowe's bombastic performance effectively derail the narrative in the second half. Although the climactic scenes, which perhaps hew too closely to the original, are striking from a stylistic perspective, by this point Tony Miller, and Crowe with him, have completely surrendered credibility.\n\nThe Exorcism represents Crowe's second recent foray into this particular sub-genre, following The Pope's Exorcist.

His father, Jason Miller, was Oscar-nominated for his role as Father Damien Karras in William Friedkin's unimpeachable The Exorcist, a movie for which \"classic\" is far too weak a word.\n\nThe Exorcism, then, is a kind of tribute to that film, which Miller - like many of us - saw at a troublingly young age. In his second exorcism-themed flick in a year (after the similarly hokey The Pope's Exorcist, which has a confirmed sequel on the way), Russell Crowe plays Anthony, a famous actor whose drink and drug problems have been as well publicised as his abandonment of his terminally ill wife. Seeking atonement, along with the forgiveness of his teenage daughter Lee (Ryan Simpkins), he takes the lead in The Georgetown Project, a movie that looks suspiciously like a remake of The Exorcist, though is never explicitly named as such.\n\nWith references galore, there's plenty of fun here for horror buffs, given that Anthony's apartment block resembles the one from Rosemary's Baby and, as eagle-eyed readers will have clocked, the movie he's making is named after the Washington suburb in which The Exorcist is set. The rubbery performances (not least from Frasier's David Hyde Pierce as the unflappable Father Conor) are well-suited to occult horror and, for a good hour, The Exorcism is absorbing, smart and packed with ruthlessly effective jump-scares.\n\nThings look bad when \"SHOOT DAY ONE\" flashes up on the screen in blood-red capitals as production begins (in The Shining, it's days of the week) and worse still when Anthony finds a pentagram scrawled on a script. As the director's uncompromising methods (which may be an allusion to Friedkin's) tip into outright bullying, Anthony's behaviour becomes weird even by A-list standards. Could he be slipping back into his old ways - or is it something to do with Molech, the Biblical demon he's been mumbling about?\n\nEither way, after things go really bananas come \"SHOOT DAY ELEVEN\", you suspect the cast of The Georgetown Project won't be gurning through press junkets about what a happy family they were on set. Alas, what begins as an emotive meta-movie about shame, forgiveness and redemption soon devolves into the worst kind of chaos. It's not so much that the film falls apart in its final act, as happens so often in horror. Instead, it's almost as if an entirely new film starts up at the 60-minute point. And this one doesn't appear to make a lick of sense.\n\nLike an inversion of the film's plot, however, the sins of the final act can't quite wash away the virtues of the first two. And let's follow the light to look on the bright side. Along with a seemingly never-ending projectile stream of diabolical Exorcist sequels and knock-offs, it's an inadvertently fitting tribute to the genius of William Friedkin's masterpiece, which clearly can't be replicated.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_bassett@nme.com", "name": "Jordan Bassett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Karras", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damien Karras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope's_Exorcist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pope's Exorcist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Friedkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_John_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua John Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgetown_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Georgetown Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary's_Baby_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosemary's Baby (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Simpkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Simpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Shining (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pentagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moloch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_promotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film promotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The_Exorcism_Crowe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664509", "eventUri": "eng-9664509", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Is This the Sign of a Career Gone to Hell?", "body": "'Inside Out 2' Review: New Feelings Propel a Pixar Sequel Enchanting Enough to Second That Emotion 1 week ago\n\nI used to simply think there were a lot of exorcist movies. There are, but that doesn't quite say it. There are so many exorcist movies that starting long ago they began to add up to something larger than the sum of their writhing, low-devil-voice-talking, mottled-gray-skin-with-carved-crucifix parts. When \"The Exorcist\" came out 50 years ago, it fed into the rise of the new fundamentalist culture. (I get it: \"The Exorcist\" was Catholic, fundamentalist Christians are not. But I stand by the point.) Because the whole thing about \"The Exorcist\" is that it felt like it was bigger than a movie. It was making an announcement: The devil is here -- and if that is so, maybe it means God is here too.\n\nThat's why exorcist movies never went away. They feed our primal ecclesiastical horror nostalgia by feeding something else: our desire to glimpse the devil in the flesh (and maybe God as a bonus). It helped, in a strange way, that the vast majority of exorcist films are B-movie trash. That makes them feel a bit off the radar and \"real,\" like \"The Blair Witch Project.\" And as the recent box-office flameout of David Gordon Green's big-budget reboot, \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" demonstrated, it's no longer enough to trot out the old tropes and clich\u00e9s. When the devil turns into a rerun, that robs him of his power faster than dunking him in a barrel of holy water.\n\nFor a while, \"The Exorcism\" seems hip to all this. It's a movie about the making of an exorcist movie, and that means that all the things you'd expect to see in an exorcist movie -- the anguished priest, the torsos bending and cracking, the exploding blasphemy of it all -- is something the film has already put in quotation marks. \"The Exorcism\" opens with a big scare sequence that turns out to be taking place on what looks like a giant dollhouse: the set for the three-story home the film is going to be shot on. A possibility is raised: Will this be a tricky Pirandellian horror movie that overlaps art and life and shows us that the devil is in the details? We at least hope it's got a crafty way to spook us.\n\nThe movie possesses the seeming benefit of starring Russell Crowe. He plays Anthony Miller, a once-hot movie star whose fall from grace was driven by his personal demons. He's an alcoholic and drug addict who basically abandoned his wife and daughter during the time that his wife was dying of cancer. He was too selfish, and became too unstable for the industry to trust. He got crucified in the media, and now, in recovery, he's paying the price: popular oblivion. The exorcist film he's starring in is his chance for a comeback.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of art-and-life parallels, this is the second exorcist film that Russell Crowe has made in a little over a year (the first, \"The Pope's Exorcist,\" was released in April 2023), and that might well be the sign of a once-hot movie star's fall from grace. But Crowe remains too good an actor to phone in what he's doing, and his performance as Tony has an undercurrent of shaggy despair unusual for the genre.\n\nEarly on, Tony's 16-year-old daughter, Lee (Ryan Simpkins), returns to his funky New York loft apartment after she gets kicked out of Catholic boarding school. For a while, we're invested in whether Tony can mend fences with her, and whether he can turn his broken life around by portraying the priest in a movie whose director, played with amusing Machiavellian ruthlessness by Adam Goldberg, will do whatever it takes to wring a good performance out of his leading man, even it means abusing the hell out of him. (In this case that's no metaphor.) \"You still devout?\" asks Goldberg's Peter, saying it like it's a dirty word. Tony is a former altar boy, so I guess that's supposed to hit him hard.\n\nOn set, Lee bonds with Tony's pop-musician costar, Blake (Chloe Bailey), the lead singer of Vampire Sorority. And Tony is coached by an on-set priest, Father Conor, a kind of intimacy-with-the-almighty coordinator played with amiable cynicism by David Hyde Pierce. There are omens, like Tony's bloody nose on the first day of shooting. The bottom line is that Tony is not giving a good performance, and what's standing in his way is his guilt for his sins, as well as the \"mysterious\" trauma that brought on his bad behavior. This is a movie that plays connect-the-dots with exorcist/Catholic/addict themes.\n\nTony starts slugging whiskey again, which on the movie's terms is a sign that the devil has appeared. The trouble is that any good exorcist movie requires a confrontation with the devil. Crowe is playing an actor playing an exorcist, and the way \"The Exorcism\" is structured what he needs to be is the therapeutic Father Merrin of his own soul. But the darker the movie gets, the less there is at stake, and the more that Crowe seems to be going through the motions of trying to save not his soul but his career.

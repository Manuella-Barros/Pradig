Rishi Sunak announced 18-year-old\u2019s would be given a choice between a placement in the armed forces or \u201cvolunteering\u201d in the community for a year if he wins the election. Volunteers would help the NHS, fire service, police, or charities aimed at supporting elderly, isolated pensioners. The prime minister said the policy would give youngsters a \u201cshared sense of purpose\u201d. But it is already unravelling on day one after Tory Home Secretary James Cleverly admitted it would not be compulsory. Speaking to the BBC on The Sunday Show, Mr Ross defended the proposals. He said: \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been speaking about is providing more opportunities for young people. \u201cWe know, following the Covid pandemic, that young people were one of the biggest cohorts of people affected by the pandemic. \u201cSo I welcome any opportunity to give young people the chance to perhaps get involved in the military service or the police or the NHS.\u201d Mr Ross was quizzed on whether it was more accurate to say teenagers would be \u201cforced\u201d into service instead of being given the opportunity to help. He said: \u201cThere is a large opportunity to get involved in the voluntary sector. \u201cLoneliness is actually one of the things that is highlighted in the government\u2019s proposals here. \u201cThat\u2019s a big issue here in Scotland. \u201cPerhaps we could help give opportunities for young people, but also help older people who are feeling lonely in Scotland at the moment.\u201d In March, it was reported Scots living in rural communities are less likely to experience loneliness than those living in urban areas. Earlier this month we exclusively revealed Scotland\u2019s largest men\u2019s mental health charity faced being wound up. The Scottish Government U-turned after initially cutting ties with the Scottish Men\u2019s Sheds Association following warnings of a \u201cloneliness time bomb\u201d. Labour branded the Tory National Service plans a \u201cheadline-grabbing gimmick\u201d. The SNP warned the policy could threaten Scotland\u2019s funding. Defending the proposals, Mr Ross said other European countries have similar schemes. The UK\u2019s last mandatory National Service scheme came to an end in 1960, and the final conscripts were discharged in 1963. Tory Home Secretary James Cleverly was forced to clarify nobody would be sent to jail for defying his party\u2019s new programme. Prime Minister Mr Sunak made a visit to a Highland port on Thursday as he kick-started his party\u2019s election campaign in Scotland. The visit was in the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, a seat the Tories hadn\u2019t even graced with a candidate yet. The backlash to National Service plans comes as: It was warned John Swinney\u2019s defence of Michael Matheson could blow up the SNP\u2019s election campaign. Anas Sarwar admitted not all employees at his family\u2019s business are paid the real living wage. Labour Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves ruled out income tax rises under a Labour government. We revealed Labour is recommending activists in Aberdeen to travel 90 miles to campaign in Fife.", "summary": "The Moray MP defended Rishi Sunak\u2019s policy to reintroduce National Service, even though it has already started unravelling.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/4991975/douglas-ross-national-service-loneliness/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/SCOTLAND_48330684-3j8x9b8s8-e1674123965461-3di7sau5e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:16:39", "author": "Justin Bowie", "authors": ["Justin Bowie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.134}

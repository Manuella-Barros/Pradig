Biden, who was born in Scranton, has attempted to portray a blue-collar image in order to reach the working and middle-class voters in the state. While the state helped to propel Biden to victory in the 2020 presidential election, recent polls have shown that his support among voters in the state is less than favorable. In reference to a New York Times/Siena/Philadelphia Inquirer poll that found Biden\u2019s support among young voters in Pennsylvania had dropped from 62 percent in 2020 to 47 percent, former Rep. Jason Altimre (D-PA) expressed shock that \u201cthings aren\u2019t going so well.\u201d The poll also found that Biden had lost support among Hispanic and black voters, down from 71 percent to 57 percent. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that things aren\u2019t going so well,\u201d Altmire told the Hill. \u201cIf there\u2019s any place where he should be doing well or better than President Trump, it\u2019s Pennsylvania because of the personal connection, because of the work he\u2019s been putting in for decades, and because the state is trending blue.\u201d A recent AARP poll showed that Trump was leading Biden by four points in Pennsylvania, 49 percent to 45 percent. When third-party candidates were added, Trump\u2019s lead increased to 46 percent, while Biden received 41 percent. A CBS News poll found that half of voters in swing states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan said the economy had worsened under the Biden administration. The same New York Times/Siena/Philadelphia Inquirer poll found that Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) was doing better than Biden, receiving roughly more than 10 points than the president.

John Fetterman (D-PA) and Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) were examples of that. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s a battleground state but it should never be a dead heat,\u201d the strategist told the outlet. \u201cBiden should always be ahead and the fact that he\u2019s not should sound alarm bells.\u201d A poll conducted by Muhlenberg College showed that Trump was leading Biden by 44 percent to 41 percent. However, in the previous poll, Biden was reportedly leading Trump 42 percent to 41 percent.

Ed Rendell (D) expressed his belief that Biden \u201cwould win\u201d if the election were to be held tomorrow. \u201cI am confident if the election were held tomorrow, he would win,\u201d Rendell told the outlet.

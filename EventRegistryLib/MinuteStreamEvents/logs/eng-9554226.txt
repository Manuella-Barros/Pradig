The Angels have also announced the swap, transferring third baseman Anthony Rendon to the 60-day injured list to create roster space. Rendon has been out since April 20 with a hamstring injury and will now be sidelined into at least late June.\n\n7:27am: The Angels are reportedly acquiring infielder Luis Guillorme from the Braves, according to Daniel Alvarez-Montes of El Extrabase. The return headed to Atlanta is not currently known.\n\nGuillorme, 29, was non-tendered by the Mets back in November but signed with the Braves in early January on a one-year, $1.1MM deal. A tenth-round pick by New York in the 2013 draft, Guillorme made his big league debut in 2018 but did not receive significant playing time until the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. While he had struggled to a .227/.303/.297 slash line in 80 games over his first two seasons in the big leagues, 2020 saw Guillorme appear in 29 of the club's 60 contests while slashing an incredible .333/.426/.439, good for a wRC+ of 145.\n\nImpressive as that performance in the shortened campaign was, it was inflated by a .463 BABIP that would be completely unsustainable over a full season. Even so, Guillorme began to see more frequent use by the Mets in the seasons following his strong performance in 2020. With that increase in playing time came improved results; Guillorme slashed a serviceable .265/.374/.311 (97 wRC+) in 69 games during the 2021 campaign, and in 335 plate appearances the following year he hit .273/.351/.340 (104 wRC+).\n\nOverall, that trio of campaigns saw Guillorme post production that was 7% better than league average off the bench while striking out just 15.4% of the time and walking at an excellent 12.4% clip. Guillorme's overall offensive performance was capped by an extreme lack of power that saw him hit just three home runs in 559 trips to the plate from 2020-22. Still, the infielder managed to make up for that not only through strong plate discipline but also excellent glovework; those years saw Guillorme post an impressive +10 Outs Above Average in limited playing time while shuffling between second base, third base, and shortstop.\n\nWhile his combination of contact, on-base ability, and versatile infield defense made Guillorme one of the better bench bats in the league over that three year stretch, the 2023 campaign saw him regress significantly. In 120 trips to the plate across 53 games, Guillorme slashed just .224/.388/.327 (70 wRC+) with much weaker peripherals than his previous seasons. His 23.3% strikeout rate was nearly a ten-point jump from where it had been the previous year, while his 8.3% walk rate was the worst of his career. Making matters worse was a regression in Guillorme's fielding that saw him go from a clearly above-average defender around the infield to below average at every spot he played. The infielder generated -4 Outs Above Average in 2023, including at least a -1 figure at each of his three positions.\n\nThat difficult 2023 season is what led the Mets to non-tender Guillorme back in November, allowing the Braves to add him to their bench mix. Unfortunately for Guillorme, however, he's been limited to just nine games this season and his .150/.190/.250 slash line in that limited playing time hardly made a case for a larger role in Atlanta. With Luke Williams currently occupying a spot on the bench and non-roster veterans such as David Fletcher and Leury Garcia able to step into Guillorme's utility role, it's unlikely the Braves will be impacted too significantly by his departure.\n\nWith that being said, it's possible the 29-year-old will receive more runway to re-establish himself in Anaheim. The club's infield has struggled to stay healthy this year with Anthony Rendon, Michael Stefanic, and Miguel Sano all currently on the injured list. Meanwhile, Luis Rengifo has been out for nearly a week due to illness and Brandon Drury could be headed to the injured list in the coming days himself after exiting yesterday's game in the sixth inning due to hamstring tightness.\n\nCole Tucker and Ehire Adrianza are currently filling in on the infield alongside shortstop Zack Neto, but Tucker has routinely struggled at the big league level throughout his career and Adrianza sports a .165/.248/.218 slash line in the majors over the past three seasons. Given those limited options, it appears likely that Guillorme will have plenty of opportunities to earn a larger role in Anaheim than he had in Atlanta over the coming weeks. If he manages to bounce back to the form he showed from 2020-22, the Angels will have found a solid in-season addition to their infield mix who could remain valuable even once the club's infield regulars begin to get healthy.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_deeds@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Nick Deeds",

The 2024 campaign has looked awfully similar to previous disappointing campaigns for the Angels, as they have crawled out to a 14-23 record while enduring several big injuries and poor production from their pitching staff. They aren't going to stand pat, though, and idly continue to rack up losses, which explains a pair of moves they made on Thursday morning.\n\nOne of the big names who has picked up an injury early this season is Anthony Rendon, who continues to struggle to stay on the field for Los Angeles. Rendon suffered a high-grade partial tear of his left hamstring back in April, and now that he's expected to be out a couple months as he attempts to heal from this injury, it led to the team going out and trading for Luis Guillorme from the Atlanta Braves. In a corresponding move, Rendon was placed on the 60-day injured list in order to make room for Guillorme on the roster.\n\nVia Jon Morosi:\n\n\"Trade today: Angels acquire Luis Guillorme from Braves in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Anthony Rendon moved to 60-day IL to clear a 40-man spot for Guillorme.\"\n\nAngels hoping Luis Guillorme can help out in Anthony Rendon's absence\n\nRendon wasn't doing much prior to his injury (.267 BA, 0 HR, 3 RBI, .632 OPS), but he is Los Angeles' starting third baseman, so they need to find a way to get by without him. Cole Tucker has largely emerged as the guy filling in for Rendon for the time being, but third base is not his natural position, and he doesn't exactly have a track record of success in the majors.\n\nThat's why picking up Guillorme was a move the front office felt a need to make. A veteran utility infielder who can fill in at several different spots, Guillorme will probably be used in several different positions for the Angels, because they need help everywhere right now. Guillorme can play at second base, third base, and shortstop, which will help give Ron Washington some options when it comes to filling out the lineup card on a nightly basis.\n\nGuillorme obviously isn't a huge producer at the plate, and he's struggled early on in limited opportunities with the Braves (.150 BA, 0 HR, 3 RBI, .440 OPS). But beggars can't be choosers, and the Angels are aware that they likely aren't going to be able to completely fill in Rendon's shoes, even though he wasn't producing much.\n\nRegardless, Los Angeles will be hoping to get anything they can out of Guillorme while they wait for Rendon to return, and his move to the 60-day injured list indicates that the team isn't expecting him back anytime soon. It's tough to see that the Angels are already down on their luck in the injury department, but at this point, it's pretty much standard operating procedure for them.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guillorme", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guillorme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rendon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_to_be_named_later", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player to be named later"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Angels-news-Los-Angeles-makes-Anthony-Rendon-roster-move-to-complete-trade-with-Braves.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554226", "eventUri": "eng-9554226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

In a corresponding roster move, the Angels transfered third baseman Anthony Rendon to the 60-day injured list, relayed via the team's official Twitter/X account:\n\nGuillorme, 29, signed with the Braves on a one-year, $1.1 million deal in January. He had previously spent his entire major league career with the New York Mets. Guillorme has struggled this year so far, slashing .150/.190/.250 with three hits, two runs, zero home runs, and three RBIs for the Braves while appearing in nine games. The Braves have one of MLB's best lineups, and Guillorme was unable to find consistency or hit enough off the bench during his short stint with the team. Overall in his career, Guillorme has slashed .258/.341/.331 with five home runs and 51 RBIs.\n\nNow, Guillorme will add to the infield for a struggling Angels team that is 14-23. While the Angels have won their last two games, they are still have the third-worst record in the American League.\n\nOn Wednesday, veteran infielder Brandon Drury exited a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates with a hamstring injury. Although the severity of Drury's injury and the duration of his absence remains to be determined, the Angels are missing half of their Opening Day infield at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, the oft-injured Rendon heads to the 60-day IL. Rendon injured his hamstring last month and has been out since April 20. Transfering a player from the 10-day IL to the 60-day IL is essentially a procedural move. It doesn't necessarily change the timetable of Rendon's projected return date, but it allows the Angels to add a player to their 40-man roster while he recuperates.\n\nStill, Rendon's seven-year, $245 million contract from 2019 doesn't look any better in light of this move. The veteran third baseman has been unable to stay on the field the last three years. He has yet to play at least 60 games with the Angels during any of his seasons with the team, despite playing in more than 130 games during five of his seven seasons with the Washington Nationals. He also has not displayed the All-Star form that he did with the Nationals in Los Angeles, when he hit over .300 from 2017-19, and instead hampers the Angels.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rendon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guillorme", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guillorme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_to_be_named_later", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Player to be named later"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Drury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Drury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_rosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball rosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3337,h_1877,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/halos_today/01hxf6fns2zsq7sx229f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554226", "eventUri": "eng-9554226", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1469, "textEnd": 1477}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Active players Kevin Pillar, Ehire Adrianza, and Luis Guillorme, all ex-Braves, followed.\n\nGuillorme is the new kid on the block.\n\nAt 29, the bearded infielder personifies the good-field, no-hit journeyman infielder.\n\nHe was only in Atlanta for a few months after signing a one-year, $1.1 million deal. A defensive stalwart at several positions, Guillorme gives Washington a potential Gold Glove at second, short, or third - positions plagued by injuries in Anaheim.\n\nThe 72-year-old Washington, the game's oldest active manager following Dusty Baker's retirement, is a former infielder known for conducting daily drills involving ground balls and short hops.\n\nGuillorme is a master in that department.\n\nIn announcing the deal, which gave the Braves a player to be named later, the Angels moved third baseman Anthony Rendon to the 60-day injured list to create roster room. The one-time National League RBI king will be out til late next month after suffering a hamstring injury on April 20.\n\nGuillorme turned pro in 2013 after the New York Mets made him their 10th-round pick in the amateur draft.\n\nHe reached the majors five years later, enjoying his best year during the pandemic-shortened season of 2020 with a .333 average and .416 on-base percentage in 29 of the 60 games played. He followed with .265 and .273 campaigns, earning his keep as a back-up infielder, but was never more than a spray hitter.\n\nHe made good contact, reaching base often, but almost never hit the ball over the fence. During his three best seasons, 2020-22, he hit just three home runs.\n\nAfter he slipped to .224 in 2023, when he got into 53 games, the Mets did not offer him a contract, making Guillorme a free agent. Atlanta signed him shortly thereafter for one year at $1.1 million but his batting slipped even further. He was hitting .150 with a .190 on-base percentage at the time he left.\n\nGuillorme appeared for Atlanta only 10 times -- one of them as a relief pitcher.\n\nWhile the Braves seem to prefer rookie speed merchant Luke Williams as their top infield backup, Guillorme should garner more playing time with the injury-riddled Angels.\n\nIn addition to Rendon, infielders Miguel Sano and Michael Stefanic are on the injured list, with Brandon Drury about to join them and Luis Rengifo also unavailable because of illness. Hence Guillorme.\n\nHe slots in ahead of Adrianza, whose bat is ahead of his glove, and Cole Tucker, another Angels incumbent.\n\nGeneral manager Perry Minasian, who also has Atlanta roots, whiffed when he traded prospects for veterans before last year's midsummer trade deadline. Five of the players he acquired, including pitchers Reynaldo Lopez and Lucas Giolito, were playing out expiring contracts and became free agents.\n\nAlthough the club ranks 13th among the 30 teams with a payroll of $173,851,423, according to Spotrac, it has had eight consecutive losing seasons - six of them with two-way star Shohei Ohtani on the roster.\n\nThe Angels finished fourth in the five-time AL West in 2023 with a 73-89 mark that left them 17 games behind the front-running Houston Astros. The team has not won a pennant since 2002, when it also won its only World Series.\n\nThough currently sitting in third place with a 14-23 record, the Angels need to shine their tarnished halos. That won't happen anytime soon with Rendon and Mike Trout injured, Ohtani thriving after signing with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, and the pitching staff still sputtering.", "source": {"uri":

He spent his first six seasons with the organization from 2018-23 before being non-tendered - along with Daniel Vogelbach, relief pitchers Jeff Brigham, Sam Coonrod and Trevor Gott- last November.\n\nGuillorme primarily as a bench player put up respectable numbers across six seasons in Flushing. Despite not being a consistent starter, Guillorme slashed: .261/.344/.333/.677; he recorded 33 doubles, five home runs, while drawing 91 walks in 823 total plate appearances. His average dipped noticeably last year (.224/.288/.327/.615 in 54 games in 2023), allowing the Mets to move on from the veteran more easily this past offseason.\n\nThe former Braves killer never found playing time in Atlanta. While the move on the surface was designed to be one for depth, the 22-12 Braves, currently in second place in the National League East - two games behind the first place Philadelphia Phillies and five clear of the 18-18 Mets - boast possibly the best infield in the Majors with Matt Olson, Ozzie Albies, Orlando Arcia and Austin Riley. Guillorme's at-bats (.150/.190/.250/.440) have been ineffective, and David Fletcher is expected to become the primary utility infielder off the bench for the Braves.\n\nIn conjunction with the Guillorme acquisition, the Angels will reportedly transfer third baseman Anthony Rendon to the 60-day injured list with a high-grade partial tear of his left hamstring. Los Angeles also lost Mike Trout, again, in April to a torn meniscus; he underwent surgery May 3 and expected recovery timetable is 2-3 months, which sidelines him until approximately August.\n\nThe Mets signed Joey Wendle to a one-year, $2 million contract last November after cutting Guillorme. Wendle, who has actively been tasked to upgrade Guillorme's former roster spot and bench role on this team, is batting .250 (eight hits) with one walk across 33 plate appearances in 14 games with New York this season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_to_be_named_later", "type":

Zack Short's the same way, albeit with a higher defensive ceiling - he can finish a game or a series if you have an injury, but you don't want him as an everyday starter.\n\nBut despite losing the left-handed bat of Guillorme, there's reason to think that these two trades can potentially give you more from an offensive perspective (and not just because he's faster than Guillorme, although that does help): Short's got hidden potential in that bat.\n\nHe's not yet shown that potential, mind you - Short's a career .169 hitter in 469 plate appearances, with just thirteen homers against 138 strikeouts.\n\nThe potential is there, though.\n\nHere's a list of players that have gotten 250 plate appearances since the start of 2023 and have the combination of a less than 20% chase rate, a greater than 80% contact rate, and a barrel rate of 8% or better:\n\nShort's career chase rate is 17.3%, more than 10% better than MLB average (28.4%). While his power isn't absurd - his career-high exit velocity is 108.2 and his 87.6 average is within 1 mph of MLB's 88.5 average - he put up a 8.7% barrel rate over that sample, almost two percent higher than the MLB average barrel rate of 6.9%.\n\nPut simply: Zack Short may be...short on overall power (sorry), but he's shown the ability to make optimal contact.\n\n(Making more contact, however, is something I'd love to see Short do. His career zone contact rate - how often he hits balls in the strike zone when he swings - is just 78.4% against the MLB average of 82.0%).\n\nA guy making the league minimum with five remaining years of team control, better defense at shortstop, better speed, and some sort of offensive potential remaining to be unlocked is better than the alternative (Guillorme), especially when that alternative was costing you $1.1M and was only here for one more season.\n\nIt's a small move, but it's all down to what hitting coach Kevin Seitzer does with it. It could pay off down the line.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Short", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zack Short"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guillorme", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guillorme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Anthopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Anthopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Seitzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Seitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4538,h_2552,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/braves_today/01hxfgmc53kcz9jke7a5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554226", "eventUri": "eng-9554226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

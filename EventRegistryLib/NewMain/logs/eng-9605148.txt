Israel had urged Palestinian civilians in Rafah, including around one million displaced by the almost eight-month-old war, to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nOUTRAGE\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the U.S. military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two U.S. officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the U.S. to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nTANKS\n\nIsrael seized control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago. Its tanks then entered some eastern districts of the city but had previously not rumbled into the centre in full force.\n\nOn Tuesday, witnesses also reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the area of the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.", "source": {"uri":

This horror must stop.\" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to continue the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages.\n\nMore air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\n\"The situation is very dangerous,\" said resident Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\n\"This happened with nowhere safe to go & amidst bombardments, lack of food & water, piles of waste & unsuitable living conditions,\" it posted on X.\n\nMore than seven months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder global opposition, as well as cases before two international courts based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn a landmark political move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\" Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which he said would be \"calm but firm\".\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nEU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\".\n\nA US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\".", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news",

hospital officials.\n\nThe strikes overnight and on Tuesday pummelled the same area where strikes had triggered a deadly fire that swept through a camp for displaced Palestinian, they said.\n\nThe tent camp inferno has drawn widespread international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah.\n\nAnd in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nPalestinians fleeing from the southern Gaza city of Rafah during an Israeli ground and air offensive in the city (Abdel Kareem Hana/AP)\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons.\n\nThe results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.\n\nThe blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than one million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday.\n\nMost had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIt was a night of horror Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, Palestinian from Gaza City\n\nFamilies are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate.\n\nIsraeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early on Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nSeven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200 metres from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December.\n\nHe said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023.\n\nPalestinians fleeing from the southern Gaza city of Rafah during an Israeli ground and air offensive in the city (Jehad Alshrafi/AP)\n\n\"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMost of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nPalestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip (Jehad Alshrafi/AP)\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 metres from an area of sheds that was targeted.\n\nIn the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah.\n\nSayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nIsraeli soldiers move on the top of a tank near the Israeli-Gaza border, as seen from southern Israel (Leo Correa/AP)\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nRafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on October 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250.\n\nMore than 100 were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it is extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying above.\n\nRelated Far-right Israeli settlers step up attacks on aid trucks bound for Gaza\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying this would cross a \"red line\" and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller gave no indication the administration sees Israel as crossing any of the red lines for Rafah, saying the offensive is still on a \"far different\" scale than assaults on other population centers in Gaza.\n\nThe International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive as part of South Africa's case accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, Gaza's Health Ministry said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighborhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead in Rafah, saying Israeli forces must enter the city to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 yards from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nA tent camp housing Palestinians displaced by the Israeli offensive is seen in Rafah, Gaza Strip, on Feb. 27, 2024.

Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.\n\nCopy

An Israeli military spokesperson said: \"As of this time, we are not aware of this incident.\"\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armored vehicles mounted with machine guns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city center.\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people. Israel said it had targeted Hamas commanders and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nTuesday's attack occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone, to which it had called on civilians in Rafah to evacuate for their own safety when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn a diplomatic move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway were to officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts toward securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nAround one million people -- many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war -- have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nA video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.\n\n\"There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God...The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We're tired,\" said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.\n\nIsrael says it's in combat near Egypt border\n\nSince Israel launched its incursion by seizing control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet rumbled into the city in full force.\n\nIn recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust toward western neighborhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt \"based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets.\"\n\nIsraeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.\n\nIsrael has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop given a high risk of civilian casualties. Israel has argued that the top UN court's decision had left it some scope for military action there.\n\nThe ICJ also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\nIn Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.\n\nIn some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city center.\n\nOUTRAGE\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres today added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the U.S. military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two U.S. officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognize a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the U.S. to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said today, citing a senior official.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported today.\n\nTANKS\n\nIsrael seized control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago. Its tanks then entered some eastern districts of the city but had previously not rumbled into the center in full force.\n\nWitnesses today also reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the area of the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.", "source": {"uri":

This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to continue the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages.\n\nMore air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\n\"The situation is very dangerous,\" said resident Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\n\"This happened with nowhere safe to go & amidst bombardments, lack of food & water, piles of waste & unsuitable living conditions,\" it posted on X.\n\nPalestinian statehood\n\nMore than seven months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder global opposition, as well as cases before two international courts based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn a landmark political move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which he said would be \"calm but firm\".\n\n'Hell on Earth'\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nHamas also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death count in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nEU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\".\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nA US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible

And in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons. The results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. The blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than 1 million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said Tuesday. Most had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas. Families are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate. Israeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Seven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200m from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before.\"\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40m from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nHe said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17kg warheads. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size.\"\n\nHagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a US-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.",

This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to continue the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages.\n\nMore air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\n\"The situation is very dangerous,\" said resident Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\n\"This happened with nowhere safe to go & amidst bombardments, lack of food & water, piles of waste & unsuitable living conditions,\" it posted on X.\n\n- Palestinian statehood -\n\nMore than seven months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder global opposition, as well as cases before two international courts based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn a landmark political move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which he said would be \"calm but firm\".\n\n- 'Hell on Earth' -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nEU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\".\n\nA US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\".\n\nburs-jd/srm/dv\n\nMore from this section\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Despite global condemnation, including from the ICJ, Spanish, Norwegian, and Irish recognition of a Palestinian state further isolated Israel. Efforts for a ceasefire were hindered as heavy fighting continued.\n\nIsrael's military denied striking a tent camp west of the city of Rafah on Tuesday after Gaza health authorities said Israeli tank shelling had killed at least 21 people there, in what Israel has designated a civilian evacuation zone. Earlier, defying an appeal from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Israeli tanks advanced to the heart of Rafah for the first time after a night of heavy bombardment, while Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state, a move that further deepened Israel's international isolation.\n\nThe United States, Israel's closest ally, reiterated its opposition to a major Israeli ground offensive in Rafah but said it did not believe such an operation was underway. Two days after an Israeli airstrike on another camp stirred global condemnation, Gaza emergency services said four tank shells hit a cluster of tents in Al-Mawasi, a coastal strip that Israel had advised civilians in Rafah to move to for safety.\n\nAt least 12 of the dead were women, according to medical officials in the Hamas militant-run Palestinian enclave. But Israel's military later said in a statement: \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.\"\n\nTuesday's incident in Al-Mawasi occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone. Israel had urged Palestinian civilians in Rafah, including around one million displaced by the almost eight-month-old war, to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May. In central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machine guns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nOUTRAGE International unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties. Global leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze. Residents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app. The Biden administration said on Tuesday it was closely monitoring the probe into Sunday's air strike. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said: \"The word tragic doesn't even begin to describe\" what happened on Sunday.\n\nBut White House spokesman John Kirby said there was nothing in the incidents on Sunday or on Tuesday that would prompt the United States to halt its military aid to Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the U.S. military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two U.S. officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago. Spain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the U.S. to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official. Around one million people - many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nTANKS Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago. Its tanks then entered some eastern districts of the city but had previously not rumbled into the centre in full force.\n\nOn Tuesday, witnesses also reported gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the area of the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\n(This story has not

This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to continue the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages.\n\nMore air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\n\"The situation is very dangerous,\" said resident Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\n\"This happened with nowhere safe to go & amidst bombardments, lack of food & water, piles of waste & unsuitable living conditions,\" it posted on X.\n\n- Palestinian statehood -\n\nMore than seven months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder global opposition, as well as cases before two international courts based in the Netherlands.\n\nMore from this section Nations Fail to Agree on Treaty on Preventing Next Pandemic Modi's 'Mujra For Vote Bank' Attack On INDIA Bloc; Kejriwal Schools Pak Neta 2024 Lok Sabha Polls Hicksville veteran awarded Purple Heart posthumously\n\nIn a landmark political move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which he said would be \"calm but firm\".\n\n- 'Hell on Earth' -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nEU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\".\n\nA US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\".\n\nburs-jd/srm/dv", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name": "Agence

This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to continue the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages.\n\nMore air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\n\"The situation is very dangerous,\" said resident Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\n\"This happened with nowhere safe to go & amidst bombardments, lack of food & water, piles of waste & unsuitable living conditions,\" it posted on X.\n\n- Palestinian statehood -\n\nMore than seven months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder global opposition, as well as cases before two international courts based in the Netherlands.\n\nIn a landmark political move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which he said would be \"calm but firm\".\n\n- 'Hell on Earth' -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nEU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\".\n\nA US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\".\n\nburs-jd/srm/dv\n\nFOX28

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty\n\nIsrael's military denied striking a tent camp west of the city of Rafah on Tuesday (local time) after Gaza health authorities said Israeli tank shelling had killed at least 21 people there, in what Israel has designated a civilian evacuation zone.\n\nEarlier, defying an appeal from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Israeli tanks advanced to the heart of Rafah for the first time after a night of heavy bombardment, while Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state, a move that further deepened Israel's international isolation.\n\nTwo days after an Israeli airstrike on another camp stirred global condemnation, Gaza emergency services said four tank shells hit a cluster of tents in Al-Mawasi, a coastal strip that Israel had advised civilians in Rafah to move to for safety.\n\nAt least 12 of the dead were women, according to medical officials in the Hamas militant-run Palestinian enclave.\n\nBut Israel's military later said in a statement: \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.\"\n\nTuesday's incident in Al-Mawasi occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone. Israel had urged Palestinian civilians in Rafah, including around one million displaced by the almost eight-month-old war, to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nOutrage\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the US military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two US officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the US to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nTanks\n\nIsrael seized control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago. Its tanks then entered some eastern districts of the city but had previously not rumbled into the centre in full force.\n\nOn Tuesday, witnesses also reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the area of the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\nReuters", "source":

This incident follows another airstrike on a camp, which had already stirred global condemnation. The ongoing conflict has caused extensive civilian casualties and international outrage.\n\nIsraeli tanks shelled a tent camp in an evacuation area west of Rafah and killed at least 21 people on Tuesday, Gaza health authorities said, while advancing to the heart of the southern Gaza city for the first time after a night of heavy bombardment. Two days after an Israeli airstrike on another camp stirred global condemnation, Gaza emergency services said four tank shells hit a cluster of tents in Al-Mawasi, a coastal strip that Israel had advised civilians in Rafah to move to for safety.\n\nAt least 12 of the dead were women, according to medical officials in the Hamas militant-run Palestinian enclave. An Israeli military spokesperson said: \"As of this time, we are not aware of this incident.\" In central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people. Israel said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault. Later on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it was\n\ninvestigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nTuesday's attack in Al-Mawasi occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone. Israel had urged civilians in Rafah to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May. In a diplomatic move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, deepening Israel's international isolation over the war.\n\nThe three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which is now in its eighth month and has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble. Residents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app. Around one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nA video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them. \"There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God... The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We're tired,\" said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the U.S. to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official.\n\nTANKS Since Israel launched its incursion by seizing control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet rumbled into the city in full force.\n\nIn recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure. Israel has kept up attacks despite the May 24 ruling by the International Court of Justice ordering it to stop, given a high risk of civilian casualties. Israel has argued that the top U.N. court's decision left it some scope for military action there.\n\nThe ICJ also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\n(This story has not been

Despite calls from global leaders for a ceasefire, Israeli tanks advanced into Rafah, deepening the humanitarian crisis.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\". In a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the U.S. military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two U.S. officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.

tent camp inferno has drawn widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive.\n\nRenewed Israeli shelling and strikes have killed at least 37 people, most of them sheltering in tents, outside the southern Gaza city of Rafah, according to witnesses, first responders and hospital officials.\n\nThe strikes overnight and on Tuesday pummelled the same area where strikes had triggered a deadly fire that swept through a camp for displaced Palestinian, they said.\n\nThe tent camp inferno has drawn widespread international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah.\n\nAnd in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.\n\nThe blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than one million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday.\n\nMost had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate.\n\nIsraeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early on Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nSeven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200 metres from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December.\n\nHe said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMost of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah.\n\nSayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nRafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nMore than 100 were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it is extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki",

Israel had urged Palestinian civilians in Rafah, including around one million displaced by the almost eight-month-old war, to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the US military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two U.S. officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the US to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nIsrael seized control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago. Its tanks then entered some eastern districts of the city but had previously not rumbled into the centre in full force.\n\nOn Tuesday, witnesses also reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the area of the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.", "source":

An Israeli military spokesperson said: \"As of this time, we are not aware of this incident.\"\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armored vehicles mounted with machine guns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city center.\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people. Israel said it had targeted Hamas commanders and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nTuesday's attack occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone, to which it had called on civilians in Rafah to evacuate for their own safety when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn a diplomatic move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nAround one million people -- many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war -- have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nA video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.\n\n\"There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God...The [Israelis] are hitting everywhere. We're tired,\" said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.\n\nIsrael says it's in combat near Egypt border\n\nSince Israel launched its incursion by seizing control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet rumbled into the city in full force.\n\nIn recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighborhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt \"based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets.\"\n\nIsraeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.\n\nIsrael has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop given a high risk of civilian casualties. Israel has argued that the top UN court's decision had left it some scope for military action there.\n\nThe ICJ also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\nIn Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.\n\nIn some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"},

international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah.\n\nAnd in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons.\n\nThe results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.\n\nThe blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than one million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday.\n\nMost had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFamilies are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate.\n\nIsraeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early on Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nSeven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200 metres from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December.\n\nHe said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMost of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 metres from an area of sheds that was targeted.\n\nIn the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah.\n\nSayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nRafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on October 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250.\n\nMore than 100 were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it is extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom.",

Rafah", "body": "Renewed Israeli shelling and strikes have killed at least 37 people, most of them sheltering in tents, outside the southern Gaza city of Rafah, according to witnesses, first responders and hospital officials.\n\nThe strikes overnight and on Tuesday pummelled the same area where strikes had triggered a deadly fire that swept through a camp for displaced Palestinian, they said.\n\nThe tent camp inferno has drawn widespread international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah.\n\nAnd in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons.\n\nThe results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.\n\nThe blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than one million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday.\n\nMost had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFamilies are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate.\n\nIsraeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early on Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nSeven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200 metres from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December.\n\nHe said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023.\n\n\"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMost of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 metres from an area of sheds that was targeted.\n\nIn the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah.\n\nSayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nRafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on October 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250.\n\nMore than 100 were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it is extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An Israeli military spokesperson said: \"As of this time, we are not aware of this incident.\"\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people. Israel said it had targeted Hamas commanders and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nTuesday's attack occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone, to which it had called on civilians in Rafah to evacuate for their own safety when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn a diplomatic move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway were to officially recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nA video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.\n\n\"There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God...The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We're tired,\" said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.\n\nISRAEL SAYS IT'S IN COMBAT NEAR EGYPT BORDER\n\nSince Israel launched its incursion by seizing control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet rumbled into the city in full force.\n\nIn recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt \"based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets\".\n\nIsraeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.\n\nIsrael has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop given a high risk of civilian casualties. Israel has argued that the top U.N. court's decision had left it some scope for military action there.\n\nThe ICJ also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\nIn Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.\n\nIn some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors":

"body": "Renewed Israeli shelling and strikes have killed at least 37 people, most of them sheltering in tents, outside the southern Gaza city of Rafah, according to witnesses, first responders and hospital officials.\n\nThe strikes overnight and on Tuesday pummelled the same area where strikes had triggered a deadly fire that swept through a camp for displaced Palestinian, they said.\n\nThe tent camp inferno has drawn widespread international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah.\n\nAnd in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.\n\nThe blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than one million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday.\n\nMost had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate.\n\nIsraeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early on Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nSeven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200 metres from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December.\n\nHe said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMost of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah.\n\nSayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nRafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nMore than 100 were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it is extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Africa's news leader.", "body": "Israel's military denied striking a tent camp west of the city of Rafah on Tuesday after Gaza health authorities said Israeli tank shelling had killed at least 21 people there, in what Israel has designated a civilian evacuation zone.\n\nEarlier, defying an appeal from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Israeli tanks advanced to the heart of Rafah for the first time after a night of heavy bombardment, while Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state, a move that further deepened Israel's international isolation.\n\nTwo days after an Israeli airstrike on another camp stirred global condemnation, Gaza emergency services said four tank shells hit a cluster of tents in Al-Mawasi, a coastal strip that Israel had advised civilians in Rafah to move to for safety.\n\nAt least 12 of the dead were women, according to medical officials in the Hamas militant-run Palestinian enclave.\n\nBut Israel's military later said in a statement: \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.\"\n\nTuesday's incident in Al-Mawasi occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone. Israel had urged Palestinian civilians in Rafah, including around one million displaced by the almost eight-month-old war, to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nOUTRAGE\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday's airstrike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday's strike and again urged Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the US military's pier off Gaza's coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two US officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the US to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel's assault on Rafah, Cairo's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure.\n\nMore than 36 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1 200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.", "source": {"uri": "sabcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

And in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons. The results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used -- targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants -- were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. The blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched May 6, has caused nearly 1 million people to flee the city, most of whom had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas. Families are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate. Israeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late Monday and early Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Seven of the dead were in tents next to a U.N. facility about about 200 meters (yards) from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighborhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 meters (yards) from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nHe said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nHagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

It is death from God ...The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We're tired,\" Moayad Fusaifas said, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.\n\nSince Israel launched its incursion by seizing control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet rumbled into the city in full force.\n\nIn recent days, Israeli tanks have advanced towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt \"based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets\".\n\nIsraeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.\n\nIsrael has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday ordering it to stop given a high risk of civilian casualties.\n\nIsrael has argued that the top UN court's decision had left it some scope for military action there.\n\nThe ICJ also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says.\n\nIsrael launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael said it wants to root out Hamas fighters hiding in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\nIn Jabalia in the northern Gaza, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.\n\nIn some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins.\n\nBiden under pressure to scale back support for Israel\n\nUS President Joe Biden is facing increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel.\n\nProminent democrat in the House of Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called yesterday's strike on Rafah \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the president to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\"\n\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\".\n\nA spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened.\n\nMr Netanyahu said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties, but went \"tragically wrong.\"\n\n\"In Rafah, we already evacuated about one million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,\" he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition politicians.\n\nSurvivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.\n\n\"We were praying ... and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,\" said one woman.\n\n\"All the children started screaming ... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.\"\n\nVideo footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames.\n\nMore than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.\n\nIsrael's military said the strike, based on \"precise intelligence\", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.\n\nThat followed the interception of eight

And in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons. The results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used -- targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants -- were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. The blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched May 6, has caused nearly 1 million people to flee the city, most of whom had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas. Families are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate. Israeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late Monday and early Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Seven of the dead were in tents next to a U.N. facility about about 200 meters (yards) from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighborhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 meters (yards) from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nHe said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nHagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

And in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons. The results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used -- targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants -- were too small to be the source.\n\nREAD MORE: Aid deliveries suspended after rough seas damage US-built temporary pier in Gaza\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. The blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched May 6, has caused nearly 1 million people to flee the city, most of whom had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas. Families are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate. Israeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late Monday and early Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Seven of the dead were in tents next to a U.N. facility about about 200 meters (yards) from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\nIt was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighborhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 meters (yards) from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nHe said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nHagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\nThat requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.\n\n___\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

At least 12 of the dead were women, as per medical officials in the Hamas militant-run Palestinian enclave.\n\nThe Israeli military denied conducting the attack, saying, \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] did not strike the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.\"\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were seen near Al-Awda mosque, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in Rafah, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nDesignated humanitarian zone\n\nGlobal unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people. World leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nTuesday's attack occurred in an area designated by Israel as an expanded humanitarian zone, to which it had called on civilians in Rafah to evacuate for their own safety when it launched its incursion in early May. Residents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters.\n\nAround one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. A video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.\n\n'Couldn't have caused blaze'\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for the Israeli military said its munitions alone \"could not\" have caused a deadly blaze that killed 45 people in Rafah. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters of Sunday's incident. He said two munitions bearing 17 kh of \"explosive material\" had targeted two senior Hamas officials.\n\nIn Cairo, an Egyptian security delegation continued efforts in coordination with Qatar and the United States to reactivate talks to reach a truce in Gaza and release hostages, Egypt's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said, citing a senior official.\n\nThe official said Egypt took a firm stance against dealing with the issue of reopening the Rafah crossing with Gaza except with Palestinian and international parties, and not with Israel, whose forces seized the crossing in May.",

Hamas said an Israeli strike on the area caused \"dozens of martyrs and wounded\".\n\nIsrael's army rejected the allegations, saying it \"did not strike\" the designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.\n\nIn Rafah, residents and a Palestinian security source said Israeli tanks had now penetrated the heart of the southern city.\n\n\"People are currently inside their homes because anyone who moves is being shot at by Israeli drones,\" one resident, Abdel Khatib, said.\n\n- 'Random bombing' -\n\nAn emergency United Nations Security Council meeting is due to discuss Sunday's deadly strike at 1915 GMT.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Israel's military said the weapons used in that strike \"could not\" have caused the deadly blaze in the camp.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" said military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.\n\nSunday evening's strike, which medics said also wounded hundreds of civilians, drew worldwide condemnation.\n\nThe sight of the charred carnage, blackened corpses and children being rushed to hospitals led UN chief Antonio Guterres to declare that \"there is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the strike as a \"tragic accident\" but affirmed the continuation of the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and to bring home all the hostages.\n\nPalestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Tuesday released a video showing an Israeli hostage alive and held in Gaza, identified by Israeli media as Sasha Trupanov, 28.\n\nAir strikes and shelling battered Gaza overnight Monday-Tuesday -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\nFaten Jouda, a 30-year-old resident, described the situation as very dangerous.\n\n\"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of the nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\n- Palestinian statehood -\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\nNearly eight months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder opposition, as well as cases before two Netherlands-based international courts.\n\nIn a landmark move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further and attacked Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which would be \"calm but firm\".\n\n- 'Hell on Earth' -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nOn the diplomatic front, Egypt has \"intensified efforts to relaunch\" negotiations for a \"truce and a detainee exchange deal\", the state-linked Al-Qahera News reported.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [],

They now seek refuge in squalid tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

AGENCY FOR GENDER EQUALITY\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The head of the United Nations agency promoting gender equality is demanding a halt to the war in Gaza, saying women and girls are suffering the most.\n\nSima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Tuesday more than 10,000 women have been killed in the seven months of fighting - including scores of women and children \"horrifically killed\" by an Israeli airstrike Monday while sleeping in tents in what was supposed to be a safe zone in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBahous told a U.N. Security Council meeting it is \"for all women and girls caught in this conflict that we demand a permanent cease-fire, unhindered humanitarian access, the release of all hostages, the determined pursuit of peace, and a two-state solution.\"\n\n\"This war must stop because women and girls are bearing the brunt of it,\" Bahous told the meeting on the role of women and youth in promoting international peace and security.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS FIRE IN RAFAH AIRSTRIKE WAS CAUSED BY SECONDARY BLAST\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says an initial investigation into a strike that sparked a deadly fire in a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah has found the blaze was caused by a secondary explosion.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said Tuesday that the military fired two 17-kilogram (37-pound) munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants. He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own and that the military is looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.\n\nThe strike or subsequent fire also could have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the densely populated tent camp housing displaced people.\n\nPalestinian health officials say at least 45 people, around half of them women and children, were killed in Sunday's strike.\n\nThe strike caused widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nISRAELI STRIKES ON RAFAH KILL AT LEAST 16 PALESTINIANS, FIRST RESPONDERS SAY\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians overnight, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city.\n\nAn Israeli incursion launched earlier this month has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas, and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a \"tragic mishap\" on Sunday and the military said it was investigating.\n\nThe latest strikes killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nNORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it \"a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.\"\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.\"\n\nHowever, \"it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\" Barth Eide said. \"The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nLast week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nSPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nMADRID -- Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October's Hamas-led attack.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes\" and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRelations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah.\n\nIRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country's president and foreign minister.\n\nOf 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran's capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"The tent camp inferno has drawn widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive.\n\nRenewed Israeli shelling and strikes have killed at least 37 people, most of them sheltering in tents, outside the southern Gaza city of Rafah, according to witnesses, first responders and hospital officials.\n\nThe strikes overnight and on Tuesday pummelled the same area where strikes had triggered a deadly fire that swept through a camp for displaced Palestinian, they said.\n\nThe tent camp inferno has drawn widespread international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah.\n\nAnd in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons.\n\nThe results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued on Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used - targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants - were too small to be the source.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.\n\nThe blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched on May 6, has caused more than one million people to flee the city, the UN agency helping Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday.\n\nMost had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFamilies are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate.\n\nIsraeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late on Monday and early on Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nSeven of the dead were in tents next to a UN facility about 200 metres from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December.\n\nHe said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighbourhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023.\n\n\"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMost of those living there had fled from the same neighbourhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the October 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 metres from an area of sheds that was targeted.\n\nIn the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nRear Admiral Hagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah.\n\nSayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nRafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on October 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250.\n\nMore than 100 were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it is extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe UN says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

Hamas said an Israeli strike on the area caused \"dozens of martyrs and wounded\".\n\nIsrael's army rejected the allegations, saying it \"did not strike\" the designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.\n\nIn Rafah, residents and a Palestinian security source said Israeli tanks had now penetrated the heart of the southern city.\n\n\"People are currently inside their homes because anyone who moves is being shot at by Israeli drones,\" one resident, Abdel Khatib, said.\n\n- 'Random bombing' -\n\nAn emergency Security Council meeting is due to discuss Sunday's deadly strike from 1915 GMT.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Israel's military said the weapons used in that strike \"could not\" have caused the deadly camp blaze.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" said its spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.\n\nSunday evening's strike, which medics said also wounded hundreds of civilians, drew worldwide condemnation.\n\nThe sight of the charred carnage, blackened corpses and children being rushed to hospitals led UN chief Antonio Guterres to declare that \"there is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the strike as a \"tragic accident\" but affirmed the continuation of the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and to bring home all the hostages.\n\nPalestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Tuesday released a video showing an Israeli hostage alive and held in Gaza, identified by Israeli media as Sasha Trupanov, 28.\n\nAir strikes and shelling had battered Gaza overnight Monday-Tuesday -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\nFaten Jouda, a 30-year-old resident, described the situation.\n\n\"There was random bombing from all directions... We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives.\"\n\n- Palestinian statehood -\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\nNearly eight months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder opposition, as well as cases before two Netherlands-based international courts.\n\nIn a landmark move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for Hamas, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which would be \"calm but firm\".\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\n- 'Hell on Earth' -\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nThe United States said it was \"deeply saddened\" over Sunday's Rafah strike and that it would follow Israel's investigation closely.\n\nThe Pentagon, meanwhile, said it had suspended aid deliveries into Gaza by the sea after its temporary pier was damaged by bad weather.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Israel's military offensive in Rafah was already taking a dire health toll in southern Gaza, and if it continues, \"substantial\" increases in deaths could be expected.\n\n\"There are currently 60 WHO trucks (in Egypt) waiting to get into Gaza,\" said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the Palestinian territories, adding that only three trucks with medical supplies had entered since May 7.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, Egypt has \"intensified efforts to relaunch\" negotiations for a \"truce and a detainee exchange deal\", the state-linked Al-Qahera News reported.", "source": {"uri":

AGENCY FOR GENDER EQUALITY\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The head of the United Nations agency promoting gender equality is demanding a halt to the war in Gaza, saying women and girls are suffering the most.\n\nSima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Tuesday more than 10,000 women have been killed in the seven months of fighting - including scores of women and children \"horrifically killed\" by an Israeli airstrike Monday while sleeping in tents in what was supposed to be a safe zone in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBahous told a U.N. Security Council meeting it is \"for all women and girls caught in this conflict that we demand a permanent cease-fire, unhindered humanitarian access, the release of all hostages, the determined pursuit of peace, and a two-state solution.\"\n\n\"This war must stop because women and girls are bearing the brunt of it,\" Bahous told the meeting on the role of women and youth in promoting international peace and security.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS FIRE IN RAFAH AIRSTRIKE WAS CAUSED BY SECONDARY BLAST\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says an initial investigation into a strike that sparked a deadly fire in a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah has found the blaze was caused by a secondary explosion.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said Tuesday that the military fired two 17-kilogram (37-pound) munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants. He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own and that the military is looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.\n\nThe strike or subsequent fire also could have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the densely populated tent camp housing displaced people.\n\nPalestinian health officials say at least 45 people, around half of them women and children, were killed in Sunday's strike.\n\nThe strike caused widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nISRAELI STRIKES ON RAFAH KILL AT LEAST 16 PALESTINIANS, FIRST RESPONDERS SAY\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians overnight, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city.\n\nAn Israeli incursion launched earlier this month has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas, and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a \"tragic mishap\" on Sunday and the military said it was investigating.\n\nThe latest strikes killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nNORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it \"a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.\"\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.\"\n\nHowever, \"it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\" Barth Eide said. \"The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nLast week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nSPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nMADRID -- Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October's Hamas-led attack.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes\" and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRelations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah.\n\nIRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country's president and foreign minister.\n\nOf 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran's capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The strike on the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood, which the Palestinian Red Crescent said is partially located in a designated humanitarian zone, has led to an international outcry. More than half of the dead are said to be women, children and the elderly.\n\nOn Tuesday, Palestinian officials claimed that at least another 21 people had been killed in tank shelling that hit another tent camp in al-Mawasi in western Rafah. The Israeli military denied this. \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in al-Mawasi,\" a statement said.\n\nIn an earlier statement, the Israeli army said that an initial investigation by their own forces into the strike on Sunday found that the blaze near the tent camp was caused by a secondary explosion. Chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that it was still unclear what set off the deadly blaze, but said that the military fired two 17-kilogram munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants. He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own and the military is looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area. The fire could have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the densely populated camp where people were sheltering under little more than tarpaulin and cloth.\n\nBritain's foreign secretary, David Cameron, described the the scenes of Sunday's strike as \"deeply depressing\" and urged Israeli military to conduct a \"swift, comprehensive, and transparent\" probe.\n\n\"Deeply distressing scenes following the airstrikes in Rafah this weekend,: Lord Cameron wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"The IDF's investigation must be swift, comprehensive & transparent. We urgently need a deal to get hostages out & aid in, with a pause in fighting to allow work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire.\"\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said \" the UK would not support a major military operation in Rafah unless we see a plan to protect the hundreds of thousands of civilians who remain there. He added that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made this point to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nMr Netanyahu has called the deadly strike on Sunday a \"tragic mishap\".\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli tanks pressed ahead with their offensive into Rafah. Tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machine guns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters.\n\nSince May Israel has mounted a ferocious ground assault into Rafah causing nearly a million people, most of them displaced multiple times to flee.\n\nThey are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps with dwindling water, food and medical supplies in other war-ravaged strip. In places like Khan Younis, which is further north and heavily destroyed civilians told The Independent they were struggling to find water.\n\nThe United States, the UK and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross\" a red line\" and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive. Israel has continued its offensive saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action in Rafah. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its most ferocious bombardment of Gaza ever in retaliation for the 7 October attack by Hamas on southern Israel, during which they killed around 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage.\n\nSince then Palestinian officials say Israel's bombing has killed more than 36,000 people the majority women and children. The focus has, in recent months, been Rafah.\n\nPalestinian health ministry officials told The Independent the city was being pounded with ferocious air strikes and tank fire, and that new strikes in the Tel al-Sultan district - the district where Sunday's strike hit - killed at least 16 Palestinians.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nThere are also concerns about the health system. Most of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Medics at the Kuwait Hospital in Rafah told The Independent it shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nPalestinian health ministry officials in Gaza said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\nMoamen, 27, who is displaced from the very north of Gaza, and was in the camp that was targeted on Sunday said most of the people remained in the area as they had been told it was in the humanitarian zone and they had no money to go anywhere les.e\n\n\" I heard three missiles and a huge, very powerful explosion that shook the place. It appears that the rockets used were incendiary, as fires broke out in the area,\" he told The Independent.\n\n\"It was a terrifying scene. I saw dismembered body parts and charred bodies, very large destruction in the tents of the displaced over a wide area,\" he added.\n\nIn a diplomatic move aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, deepening Israel's international isolation over the war.\n\nThe three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bel_trew@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Bel

Hamas said an Israeli strike on the area caused \"dozens of martyrs and wounded\".\n\nIsrael's army rejected the allegations, saying it \"did not strike\" the designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.\n\nIn Rafah, residents and a Palestinian security source said Israeli tanks had now penetrated the heart of the southern city.\n\n\"People are currently inside their homes because anyone who moves is being shot at by Israeli drones,\" one resident, Abdel Khatib, said.\n\n- 'Random bombing' -\n\nAn emergency United Nations Security Council meeting is due to discuss Sunday's deadly strike at 1915 GMT.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Israel's military said the weapons used in that strike \"could not\" have caused the deadly blaze in the camp.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" said military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.\n\nSunday evening's strike, which medics said also wounded hundreds of civilians, drew worldwide condemnation.\n\nThe sight of the charred carnage, blackened corpses and children being rushed to hospitals led UN chief Antonio Guterres to declare that \"there is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the strike as a \"tragic accident\" but affirmed the continuation of the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and to bring home all the hostages.\n\nPalestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Tuesday released a video showing an Israeli hostage alive and held in Gaza, identified by Israeli media as Sasha Trupanov, 28.\n\nAir strikes and shelling battered Gaza overnight Monday-Tuesday -- including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\nFaten Jouda, a 30-year-old resident, described the situation as very dangerous.\n\n\"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft.\n\n\"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said of the nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\".\n\n- Palestinian statehood - More from this section Emma

wiped out a decade of life expectancy gains, WHO says\n\nUNRWA said one million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\nNearly eight months into the deadliest Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder opposition, as well as cases before two Netherlands-based international courts.\n\nIn a landmark move on Tuesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain formally recognised the State of Palestine, a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western governments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the recognition was \"not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\".\n\n\"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and security.\"\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the aim was to keep Middle East peace hopes alive, and urged Israel to \"stop the humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has slammed the recognition as a \"reward\" for the Islamist Hamas movement, and recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz went further and attacked Sanchez on X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\".\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said the three governments would \"issue a coordinated response\" to Israel which would be \"calm but firm\".\n\n- 'Hell on Earth' -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,096 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said.\n\nIt said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\n\nThe civilian death toll in the Gaza camp prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\".\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\".\n\nOn the diplomatic front, Egypt has \"intensified efforts to relaunch\" negotiations for a \"truce and a detainee exchange deal\", the state-linked Al-Qahera News reported.\n\nburs-jd/dv/srm", "source": {"uri":

They now seek refuge in squalid tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognize a Palestinian state as EU rift with Israel widens.\n\n-- Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah over the weekend was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\n-- As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food.\n\n-- An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWOMEN AND GIRLS SUFFERING THE MOST IN GAZA, SAYS HEAD OF U.N. AGENCY FOR GENDER EQUALITY\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The head of the United Nations agency promoting gender equality is demanding a halt to the war in Gaza, saying women and girls are suffering the most.\n\nSima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Tuesday more than 10,000 women have been killed in the seven months of fighting - including scores of women and children \"horrifically killed\" by an Israeli airstrike Monday while sleeping in tents in what was supposed to be a safe zone in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBahous told a U.N. Security Council meeting it is \"for all women and girls caught in this conflict that we demand a permanent cease-fire, unhindered humanitarian access, the release of all hostages, the determined pursuit of peace, and a two-state solution.\"\n\n\"This war must stop because women and girls are bearing the brunt of it,\" Bahous told the meeting on the role of women and youth in promoting international peace and security.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS FIRE IN RAFAH AIRSTRIKE WAS CAUSED BY SECONDARY BLAST\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says an initial investigation into a strike that sparked a deadly fire in a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah has found the blaze was caused by a secondary explosion.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said Tuesday that the military fired two 17-kilogram (37-pound) munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants. He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own and that the military is looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.\n\nThe strike or subsequent fire also could have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the densely populated tent camp housing displaced people.\n\nPalestinian health officials say at least 45 people, around half of them women and children, were killed in Sunday's strike.\n\nThe strike caused widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nISRAELI STRIKES ON RAFAH KILL AT LEAST 16 PALESTINIANS, FIRST RESPONDERS SAY\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians overnight, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city.\n\nAn Israeli incursion launched earlier this month has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas, and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a \"tragic mishap\" on Sunday and the military said it was investigating.\n\nThe latest strikes killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nNORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it \"a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.\"\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.\"\n\nHowever, \"it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\" Barth Eide said. \"The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nLast week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nSPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nMADRID -- Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October's Hamas-led attack.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes\" and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRelations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah.\n\nIRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country's president and foreign minister.\n\nOf 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran's capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Hamas attack despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the enclave.\n\nNearly 36,100 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority being women and children, and over 81,000 others injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of \"genocide\" at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [],

In a statement issued hours before the meeting, Israel's military said the weapons used in Sunday's strike \"could not\" have caused the deadly blaze in the Rafah camp.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" said military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.\n\nWorldwide condemnation\n\nSunday evening's strike, which medics said also wounded hundreds of civilians, drew worldwide condemnation. The sight of the charred carnage, blackened corpses and children being rushed to hospitals led UN chief Antonio Guterres to declare that \"there is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\"\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to continue the campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages.\n\nMore air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza - including the Tal al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. UNRWA said 1 million civilians had fled Rafah since Israel launched its assault on the city in early May despite a chorus of international warnings.\n\n\"This happened with nowhere safe to go & amidst bombardments, lack of food & water, piles of waste & unsuitable living conditions,\" it posted on X.\n\nSunday night's attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said. It said aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the group in the occupied West Bank. The strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets towards Tel Aviv, with most being intercepted.\"", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"},

A military spokesman said Tuesday the munitions used in the Israeli strike were too small to set off a big blaze.\n\nA Palestinian child, wounded in an Israeli strike on an area designated for displaced people, is assisted at a hospital, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, May 26, 2024.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said the attack ignited tent fires in an area sheltering displaced people. Israel said it killed two senior Hamas militants in the attack.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council was meeting Tuesday afternoon in a closed session requested by member Algeria to discuss the attack.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Tuesday that the \"relentless violence\" must stop and reiterated his call for a humanitarian cease-fire and the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages.\n\nGaza medical personnel and residents reported new Israeli airstrikes Tuesday in the area of al-Mawasi on the enclave's coast, where thousands of people have fled to what Israel has said is a designated 'safe zone.\"\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said at least 20 civilians were killed. The Israel Defense Forces denied striking the area.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians inspect their tents destroyed by Israel's bombardment, adjunct to an UNRWA facility west of Rafah city, Gaza Strip, May 28, 2024.\n\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Tuesday that more than 940,000 people have fled Rafah in the past three weeks amid Israel's offensive. Another 100,000 have been displaced by fighting in northern Gaza.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths issued a statement late Monday calling the Rafah attack \"utterly unacceptable.\" He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's explanation that what happened was a \"tragic mistake.\"\n\n\"Whether the attack was a war crime or a 'tragic mistake,' for the people of Gaza, there is no debate,\" Griffiths said. \"What happened last night was the latest - and possibly most cruel - abomination. To call it 'a mistake' is a message that means nothing for those killed, those grieving, and those trying to save lives.\"\n\nGriffiths said the U.N. \"warned that a military operation in Rafah would lead to a slaughter\" and added that there are no safe areas or humanitarian zones in Gaza.\n\n'Despite our best effort, not to harm those not involved, unfortunately a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the case,' Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel needs to carry out an offensive in Rafah in order to achieve its goal of ensuring Hamas cannot operate in Gaza and threaten Israel in the future.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, decried the Rafah attack, saying in a statement Monday, 'The images from the camp are horrific and point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by Israel that have already led to so many civilian deaths.'\n\nFILE - U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk is shown on Aug. 9, 2023.\n\nEven as he noted the Israeli military's announced investigation, T\u00fcrk said it was 'shockingly clear' that the decision to strike an area 'densely packed with civilians' would result in the 'entirely predictable outcome' of the death of more Palestinian civilians.\n\nT\u00fcrk called on Israel to abide by last week's International Court of Justice order to totally halt its offensive in Rafah. He also urged Palestinian armed groups to stop firing rockets indiscriminately into Israel 'in clear violation of international humanitarian law' and release all the remaining 100 or so hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza.\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel also called the strikes \"horrendous\" and urged Israel to stop its offensive in Rafah.\n\n\"Horrendous to see innocent Palestinian civilians killed in the recent attack. There is no safe zone for the internally displaced in Rafah,\" Michel said on the X social media platform.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry said Monday that the attack could complicate efforts to mediate stalled cease-fire talks and the return of the hostages held in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war was triggered by the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials, and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent counteroffensive has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, a death toll that includes both civilians and combatants, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nU.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

An Israeli military spokesperson said: \"As of this time, we are not aware of this incident.\"\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nInternational unease over Israel's three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nAt Algeria's request, the UN Security Council was scheduled to hold an urgent closed-door session later yesterday to discuss the situation in Rafah.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \"humanitarian zone\" of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel's assault.\n\nIn a diplomatic move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state yesterday.\n\nThe three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel's offensive in Gaza, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nThe health ministry in Gaza said yesterday that at least 36,096 Palestinians have been killed in the territory during the offensive. The toll includes at least 46 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said.\n\nResidents said Rafah's Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday's night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\nAround one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the offensive - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported yesterday.\n\nA video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@thedailystar.net", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "cairo@thedailystar.net", "name": "Cairo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian enclaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian right of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2023/06/18/ds-logo-share.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605148", "eventUri": "eng-9605148", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

They also said Israel tanks had moved into the centre of Rafah.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that the US has reached out to Israel to demand an investigation and raise concerns about the initial strike.\n\n\"The [Israeli army] is continuing to investigate this matter and has promised that its investigation will be swift, comprehensive and transparent. We will be watching those results closely,\" he said.\n\nThe attack prompted immediate global condemnation from world leaders, aid groups and concerned citizens, while the White House has remained largely silent over the past few days.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons in Rafah.\"\n\n\"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\" he added, calling for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f2nio Guterres was similarly forceful in his response. \"I condemn Israel's actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict,\" he said on X. \"There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\"\n\nThe strike came just two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" in Rafah in a landmark emergency ruling that invoked the Genocide Convention.\n\nThe attack is likely to increase pressure on Mr Biden to reevaluate his support for Israel's war in Gaza, after vowing to withhold offensive weapons from the longtime US ally if it launched a major operation in Rafah.\n\nMr Biden has repeatedly expressed his strong opposition to a major offensive in Rafah, which had become the last refuge for more than a million Palestinians who had fled from the war raging in other parts of Gaza. It is also where most aid agencies are operating.\n\nIn a March interview with MSNBC, when asked whether an Israeli invasion of Rafah would be a red line for him, he replied: \"It is a red line but I'm never going to leave Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical.\"\n\nHis officials have repeatedly said the US would not support a \"major military operation\" in Gaza's southern city without a \"credible ... executable\" plan to protect civilians.\n\nMr Miller said Israel's operation in Gaza was not of the \"scale\" of previous operations that had prompted US concern, but he said the US was \"watching closely.\"\n\nVice president Kamala Harris did not comment when questioned if the attack breached Mr Biden's red line, but said: \"The word tragic doesn't even begin to describe it.\"\n\nThe Israeli army quickly claimed response for the attack on Sunday, claiming its air force had struck a Hamas compound with \"precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence,\" killing two Hamas officials in the process. But the next day, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a \"tragic mishap\" in an address to Israel's parliament and promised an investigation.\n\nThe Israeli army said Tuesday that it was investigating the possibility that a secondary explosion caused by weapons stored near where the strike occurred may have set tents ablaze.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

Footage showed charred bodies, as well as a man holding a beheaded baby as screams were heard all around him.\n\nUNRWA's Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Monday that images from the attack \"are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth.\"\n\nLazzarini said UNRWA is doing \"everything possible\" not to interrupt the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\n\n\"But with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible,\" he stressed.\n\nThe UNRWA Chief said he echoed the dismay expressed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the \"lack of implementation\" of the recent court order by the International Court of Justice regarding Rafah, emphasizing that \"The decisions of the ICJ are binding.\"\n\nHe warned that the military operation in Rafah \"must immediately end & the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza must improve without further delay.\"\n\nThe ICJ on Friday ordered Israel to halt its ground invasion of Rafah, withdraw its forces and ensure unimpeded humanitarian aid into the enclave.\n\nIsrael has however intensified its attacks on the town.\n\nAt least 20 people were killed and many others wounded on Tuesday in a new massacre carried out by the Israeli occupation army, which bombed a camp for displaced people in the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PalestineChron/status/1795486141988413768\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 36,096 Palestinians have been killed, and 81,136 wounded in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 11,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nInternational Court of Justice Orders Immediate Halt of Israel's Operation in Rafah - BREAKING\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nIsrael says that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation on October 7.

All the injured and the dead bodies have been transferred to the International Medical Corps field hospital. There are no ambulances.\"\n\nFootage shared on social media and verified by Al Jazeera's Sanad fact-checking agency showed what appeared to be several people killed and wounded after an attack.\n\nPeople are seen frantically attending to the bloodied victims and covering the bodies of those killed with blankets.\n\nThe Palestinian president's spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, described the latest Israeli attack on Rafah as a \"massacre\", and called for the implementation of a decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering Israel to halt its offensive on Rafah.\n\nIsrael has continued to press its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action in Rafah.\n\nThe attack on the camp for displaced people came two days after an attack on a camp in the Tal as-Sultan area near Rafah that killed 45 Palestinians. After the attack, a fire spread rapidly, razing the encampment to the ground.\n\nThe Wafa news agency, quoting the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said that many of those who died were \"burned alive\" inside their tents.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday that Israel's munitions alone \"could not\" have caused the deadly blaze.\n\n\"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" Hagari said in a news briefing on the preliminary findings of the army's investigation into the attack.\n\nHamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, has called on the UN to act to stop Israeli attacks on tents where displaced families are sheltering in Rafah.\n\n\"The international community, the UN Security Council, and the ICJ, need to move urgently and take immediate action to stop these grave violations and protect civilians including women and children,\" Hamas said in a statement.\n\nAt its most crowded, Rafah was home to about 1.5 million people, most of whom are now on the move, trying to get away from Israel's tanks and air raids.\n\nAid agencies and the UN have warned that the widely criticised Rafah offensive is worsening an already dire humanitarian situation in the besieged and bombarded enclave.\n\nThe forced expulsion of Palestinians has made it increasingly difficult for aid workers to distribute dwindling supplies of aid to families facing catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nIsrael seized control of the Palestinian side of the vital Rafah border crossing with Egypt on May 7, shortly after it launched its long-threatened military offensive in the overcrowded area.\n\nIt is continuing to bar the entry of humanitarian supplies, including much-needed fuel. Scarce amounts of aid used to enter the Strip via the crossing since Israel launched its latest assault on Gaza on October 7.\n\nThe lack of fuel and medicine has led to the shutting down of several hospitals in Gaza. The Kuwait Specialty Hospital was forced out of service by Israeli attacks, Palestinian officials said on Tuesday, leaving only one hospital operating in the city.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com",

Israel had urged Palestinian civilians in Rafah, including around 1 million displaced by the almost eight-month-old war, to evacuate there when it launched its incursion in early May.\n\nIn central Rafah, tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a city landmark, witnesses said. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.\n\nInternational unease over Israel\u2019s three-week-old Rafah offensive has turned to outrage after an attack on Sunday set off a blaze in a tent camp in a western district of the city, killing at least 45 people.\n\nIsrael said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.\n\nGlobal leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order last week for a halt to Israel\u2019s assault.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the possibility that munitions stored near a compound targeted by Sunday\u2019s air strike may have ignited and touched off the blaze.\n\nResidents said Rafah\u2019s Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday\u2019s nighttime strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.\n\n\u201cTank shells are falling everywhere in Tel al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\u201d one resident said via a chat app.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday added his voice to the chorus of condemnation of Sunday\u2019s strike and again urged Israel to allow \u201cthe immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\u201d.\n\nIn a further blow to aid efforts, a part of the US military\u2019s pier off Gaza\u2019s coast has broken off, probably due to bad weather, rendering it temporarily inoperable, two US officials said. The United Nations has transported 137 trucks of aid from the pier since it began operations two weeks ago.\n\nSpain, Norway and Ireland said they hoped their decision to recognise a Palestinian state would speed up efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas militants, which has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.\n\nEgypt is again trying in tandem with Qatar and the US to revive talks on a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, but efforts have been hampered by Israel\u2019s assault on Rafah, Cairo\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel said on Tuesday, citing a senior official.\n\nAround 1 million people \u2013 many repeatedly uprooted by shifting waves of the war \u2013 have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nIsrael seized control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago. Its tanks then entered some eastern districts of the city but had previously not rumbled into the centre in full force.\n\nOn Tuesday, witnesses also reported gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the area of the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt and troops were engaged in close-quarter combat, locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive, Gaza\u2019s health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out the last major intact formations of Hamas fighters hunkered down in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.", "source":

We need an immediate cease-fire.'\n\nMassie, R-Ky., shot back: 'Ma'am, you voted to send those bombs to Israel.'\n\nWarren voted to pass a $95 billion foreign aid package that included $26 billion for Israel and Gaza. Some $9 billion was for humanitarian assistance in Gaza and over $9 billion went to Israel's defenses.\n\nMassie opposed the package and signed on to an unsuccessful effort to try to oust Speaker Mike Johnson over it.\n\nLibertarian-minded Rep. Thomas Massie reminded Sen. Elizabeth Warren she voted for a foreign aid bill that sent arms to Israel as the Massachusetts Democrat called the IDF's offensive in Rafah 'horrific'\n\nIsrael expressed regret that its bombing had killed civilians in a refugee camp in Rafah - but said their missiles had killed two senior Hamas leaders.\n\nAt least 45 people were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, including 23 women, children and older people. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the civilian deaths were a 'tragic accident.'\n\nNetanyahu said the Israeli Defense Forces tried to minimize civilian deaths by asking Gazans to evacuate, but 'despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians, a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.'\n\nHe accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, saying: 'For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas it's a strategy. That's the whole difference.'\n\nThe strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate's Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes.\n\nFootage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children.\n\nAs Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated.\n\nThe strike came after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive of Rafah and officials are trying to restart ceasefire negotiations.\n\nIt caused caused international outrage.\n\n'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' a spokesperson for President Biden's National Security Council said.\n\nA person reacts at the site of an Israeli strike on a camp for displaced people in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, May 27, 2024\n\nChild is seen at the site of an Israeli strike on a camp for displaced people in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, May 27, 2024\n\nChild looks on at the rubble after Israel's bombing of tents in Rafah\n\n'Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we've been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened, and understand that the IDF is conducting an investigation.'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he was 'outraged' over Israel's latest attacks. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,' he said on X.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the attack 'an indefensible atrocity', adding in a social media post that 'it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.'\n\n'Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,' Representative Ayanna Pressley. 'How much longer will the U.S. stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?'\n\nAdditionally, Israeli forces exchanged gunfire with Egyptian troops along their shared border that resulted in the death of at least one Egyptian soldier.\n\nThe IDF this afternoon reported a 'shooting incident' at the border close to the crossing into Gaza, adding that it was discussing the issue with the Egyptian authorities but revealed no further information.\n\n'A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border.

And in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons. The results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used -- targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants -- were too small to be the source.\n\nSt. Louis alt-weekly Riverfront Times sold, lays off all staff Sisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says The end of Riverfront Times brings shock, sense of loss.

It's time for Cardinals to swing trade for rotation help.\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. The blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched May 6, has caused more than 1 million people to flee the city, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees said Tuesday. Most had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas. Families are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate. Israeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city, and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late Monday and early Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Seven of the dead were in tents next to a U.N. facility about about 200 meters (yards) from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighborhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 meters (yards) from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nHe said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nHagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe tent camp inferno has drawn widespread international outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies, over the military's expanding offensive into Rafah. And in a sign of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage, Spain, Norway and Ireland formally recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military suggested Sunday's blaze in the tent camp may have been caused by secondary explosions, possibly from Palestinian militants' weapons. The results of Israel's initial probe into the fire were issued Tuesday, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying the cause of the fire was still under investigation but that the munitions used -- targeting what the army said was a position with two senior Hamas militants -- were too small to be the source.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe strike or the subsequent fire could also have ignited have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. The blaze killed 45 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials' count. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nIsrael's assault on Rafah, launched May 6, has caused nearly 1 million people to flee the city, most of whom had already been displaced multiple times in the nearly eight-month war between Israel and Hamas. Families are now scattered across makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe strikes over the past few days have hit areas west of Rafah, which had not been ordered by the military to evacuate. Israeli ground troops and tanks have been operating in eastern Rafah, in central parts of the city and along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nShelling late Monday and early Tuesday hit Rafah's western Tel al-Sultan district, killing at least 16 people, the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Seven of the dead were in tents next to a U.N. facility about about 200 meters (yards) from the site of Sunday night's strike and fire.\n\n\"It was a night of horror,\" said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard \"constant sounds\" of explosions overnight and into Tuesday, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. \"We saw this before,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and other allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Israeli drone strike hit tents near a field hospital by the Mediterranean coast west of Rafah, killing at least 21 people, including 13 women, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\n\nA witness, Ahmed Nassar, said his four cousins and some of their husbands and children were killed in the strike and that a number of tents were destroyed or damaged. Most of those living there had fled from the same neighborhood in Gaza City earlier in the war.\n\n\"They have nothing to do with anything,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must enter Rafah to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn its investigation of Sunday's deadly strike and fire, the Israeli military released satellite photos of what it said was a Hamas rocket launch position about 40 meters (yards) from an area of sheds that was targeted. In the photo, the alleged launcher itself did not appear to have been struck.\n\nHe said Israeli warplanes used the smallest munition possible - two munitions with 17-kilogram warheads. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\" he said.\n\nHagari said that the fire was \"a devastating incident which we did not expect\" and said it ignited due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nStill, the strikes have triggered a flight of people from areas west of Rafah. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families were heading to the crowded Muwasi area or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\n\"The situation is worsening\" in Rafah, al-Masri said.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan are out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. Rafah's Kuwait Hospital shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva. \"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's extremely difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier, but it's nowhere near the 600 trucks a day that aid groups say are needed.\n\n___\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

Israel had advised people in Rafah to move to the area for safety. According to medical officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave, at least 12 of the dead were women.\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement: \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.\"\n\nThe deaths came as Israeli forces continued to advance in Rafah on Tuesday, with residents reporting tanks in the centre of the city for the first time. Troops also advanced along the strategically important Philidelphi route, which runs along the border with the Egyptian Sinai.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas compounds and cross-border tunnels were destroyed and many Hamas militants were killed in clashes.\n\nIsraeli forces attacked Rafah three weeks ago despite intense international pressure, including from Washington. Some one million residents have fled the southern city to avoid the fighting, most of them refugees from central and northern Gaza who left combat zones earlier during the 235-day conflict.\n\nInternational unease over the offensive turned to outrage on Sunday after an attack caused a fire in a tented camp in Rafah, killing at least 45 people.\n\nThe Israeli military on Tuesday released the initial findings of an investigation into the strike, which it said indicated that Hamas munitions stored in the area might have caused the blaze.\n\nIDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari confirmed that two Hamas commanders were killed in the air strike. \"The fire that broke out was unexpected and unintended,\" he said. \"Our munition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size. We are looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know about, may have ignited as a result of the strike.\"\n\nHe also played what he said was a phone call intercepted by Israeli intelligence between two Gaza residents indicating that weapons stored in a nearby compound caught fire.\n\nThe attack prompted global criticism of Israel, with prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu saying the civilian deaths in the area was a \"tragic mistake\".\n\nThe UN security council convened an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the Rafah incident. Earlier, UN general secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned Sunday's strike and called on Israel to allow \"the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need\".\n\nThe US military is expected to formally announce that it is suspending aid deliveries into Gaza via its temporary pier after the ramp connecting the pier to the shore suffered damage amid heavy seas and bad weather.\n\nAccording to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, more than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on October 7th last. Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 253 hostages seized in the surprise Hamas attack on that day. It says 125 hostages remain in Hamas captivity but it is not known how many are alive.\n\nIslamic Jihad on Tuesday released a video of Israeli hostage Sasha Popanov, who was kidnapped on October 7th. He begins the short video by saying \"in the next few days, you will hear the truth of what happened to me, as well as the other prisoners in Gaza.\"\n\nIt is not clear when the clip was filmed. His father, Vitali, was murdered on October 7th, and his mother, grandmother and partner were released as part of the previous hostage release deal. - Additional reporting: Reuters", "source": {"uri":

Israel's army said the air strikes late Sunday, hours after a rocket attack had targeted Tel Aviv, had killed two senior Hamas operatives, and that it was investigating the reports of civilians killed in a fire.\n\nThe Israeli attack sparked strong protests from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait and from Qatar, which warned it could \"hinder\" budding steps to revive stalled truce and hostage release talks in the Israel-Hamas war raging since 7 October. Gaza's civil defence agency said many bodies were \"charred\" after the strikes triggered a fire that ripped through a displacement centre in northwest Rafah.\n\n\"The massacre committed by the Israeli occupation army in the refugee tents northwest of Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip has left 40 martyrs and 65 wounded,\" said agency official Mohammad al-Mughayyir. \"We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs ... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly.\"\n\nFootage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic night-time scenes of paramedics in ambulances racing to the fiery attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children.\n\n\"We had just done with the evening prayers,\" recalled one survivor, a Palestinian woman who declined to be named. \"Our children were asleep ... suddenly we heard a loud sound, and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming ... the sound was terrifying.\"\n\nThe ICRC said one of its field hospitals was receiving an \"influx of casualties seeking care for injuries and burns\" and that \"our teams are doing their best to save lives\". AFP images after sunrise showed the charred remains of makeshift tents and vehicles as Palestinian families looked at the blackened destruction.\n\nIsrael's army had said overnight that its aircraft had \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\", killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian militant group in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIt added that it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\"\n\nMughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impacts of Israel's siege on the territory amid the over seven-months-old conflict. \"There is a fuel shortage ... there are roads that have been destroyed, which hinders the movement of civil defence vehicles in these targeted areas,\" he said. \"There is also a shortage of water to extinguish fires.\"\n\nEgypt deplored the \"targeting of defenceless civilians\" and labelled it part of \"a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable\". Jordan also expressed its condemnation, accusing Israel of committing \"ongoing war crimes\". Kuwait charged the attack exposed Israel's \"blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world\". And Qatar condemned the Israeli bombing as a \"dangerous violation of international law\".\n\nThe strike came hours after Hamas had on Sunday, for the first time in months, launched a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv and other areas of central Israel, sending people running into bomb shelters. Although Israeli air defences took out most of the rockets and no casualties were reported, the attack was seen as an effort by Hamas to signal that it remains undefeated. Hamas's armed wing said it had targeted Tel Aviv \"with a large rocket barrage in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians\".\n\nIsrael invaded Gaza in late October, but its ground forces are still battling Hamas in northern and central areas where Hamas has regrouped, as well as around Rafah. Israel's top ally, the United States, has strongly urged all sides to resume truce talks, with efforts underway in recent days toward new talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators.\n\nAfter the latest violence, Qatar's foreign ministry voiced \"concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts and hinder reaching an agreement for an immediate and permanent ceasefire\". Hamas said, after the overnight strikes, that Palestinians must \"rise up and march\".\n\nThe 7 October attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than\n\n1 170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35 984 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israeli military said its jets had over the past 24 hours struck and destroyed \"over 75 terror targets\" across the Gaza Strip. The United Nations has warned of looming famine in besieged Gaza, where most hospitals are no longer functioning.\n\nThe bloodiest-ever Gaza war\n\nand the spiralling civilian death toll have sparked a growing global backlash against Israel, including cases before two international courts in The Hague.", "source": {"uri": "neweralive.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Era Live"}, "authors":

At least 45 people, around half of them women and children, were killed, according to local health officials.\n\nThe deadly bombing sparked global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a \"tragic mistake\".\n\nThe Israeli military on Tuesday claimed its initial investigation into the strike indicated the fire was caused by a secondary explosion.\n\nRear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, claimed Israel's military fired two 17kg munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants.\n\nHe claimed the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and that the military was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.\n\nIt has not been possible to independently verify his claims.\n\nThe fire triggered by the bombing also could have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the densely populated tent camp housing displaced people.\n\nIsrael's closest allies have been among those who have strongly condemned the killings.\n\nNearly a million have been forced to flee Rafah since Israel launched an incursion there in early May. Most of the people had already been displaced by Israeli attacks.\n\nThey now seek refuge in squalid tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nThe US and other close allies of Israel have warned against a fully-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying that would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an operation.\n\nOn Friday, the International Court of Justice - the UN's top court - ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive - although Israel looks set to ignore the demand.\n\nIsrael claims it is carrying out limited operations in eastern Rafah along the Gaza-Egypt border, although residents also reported heavy bombardment overnight in western parts of Rafah.\n\nRead more\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu says airstrike on Rafah which killed dozens was 'tragic mistake'\n\nRafah is 'hell on Earth', warns UN agency head - as outrage grows\n\nSayed al Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families had been forced to flee their homes and shelters, with most heading for the crowded area of al Mawasi, where giant tent camps have been set up on a barren coastline, or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting.\n\nGaza's health ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al Sultan were out of service because of intense bombing nearby.\n\nMedical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al Sultan medical centre and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside.\n\nMost of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning. The Kuwait Hospital in Rafah shut down on Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organisation said the casualties from Sunday's strike and fire \"absolutely overwhelmed\" field hospitals in the area, which were already running short on supplies to treat severe burns.\n\n\"That requires intensive care, that requires electricity, that requires high-level medical services,\" Dr Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are struggling to even have the high-level skilled doctors and nurses because they've been displaced.\"\n\nThe Israeli offensive began after Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people and abducting around 250 others. More than 100 were released during a ceasefire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack with a huge air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 36,096 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nAround 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the

Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident said via a chat app.\n\nAbout 1-million people, many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war, have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.\n\nA video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah's shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.\n\n\"There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God. They (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We're tired,\" said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.\n\nSince Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet moved into the city in full force.\n\nGun battles\n\nIn recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.\n\nWitnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt \"based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets\". Israeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.\n\nIsrael has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the top UN court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.\n\nSince Sunday's strike on the tent camp, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said.\n\nIn Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces were engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.\n\nIn some residential districts from which Israeli forces retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An Israeli military official said tanks were being used as part of what he called a limited and precise set of operations.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the country needed to start a ground invasion of Rafah to seek out the thousands of Hamas terrorist fighters and some leaders it says are based in the city, as well as some hostages. The plan has drawn international condemnation -- including from the U.S. -- even after Israel insisted it would first allow civilians to leave.\n\nThe United Nations says roughly 1 million civilians have fled Rafah, having sought shelter there during fighting elsewhere in Gaza.\n\nIsrael said Sunday an airstrike on a tent camp northwest of the city was based on precise intelligence and that it killed two senior officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union. Netanyahu called the incident a \"tragic mistake.\"\n\nAnother Israeli strike on Rafah on Tuesday killed 20 Palestinians, Gaza's civil defense service reported.\n\nThe conflict began when Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. The Palestinian death toll from the war as a whole is now more than 36,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military has found a number of tunnels from Rafah into Egypt and destroyed them, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel's chief military spokesman, adding that Egypt was being kept informed.\n\nHagari said an ongoing probe into the fire that killed 45 Gazans during the Sunday night airstrike suggests it was caused by a secondary explosion, possibly as a result of arms stored by Hamas in a separate structure.\n\nHe said the warplanes that killed the two Hamas commanders used the smallest munitions they have, and those alone couldn't have ignited the fire. He added that Hamas rocket launchers had been found some 43 meters away and Hamas has embedded itself in that part of Rafah among sheltering civilians since Oct. 7.\n\nHagari also played an intercepted phone call that he said was between two Gazans discussing the explosion and fire. One speaks of \"ammunition that started exploding\" and the other responds, \"This is an ammunition warehouse. I tell you it exploded. I mean, the Jewish bombing wasn't strong, it was a small missile because it didn't create a large hole.\"\n\nIsrael had pledged to invade Rafah while limiting civilian casualties, even as the city's population swelled to about 1.4 million mostly displaced people. The U.S. and other allies fear mass deaths, and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail plans for the assault.\n\nThe war has inflamed the region and led to widespread criticism of Israel. The International Court of Justice published a ruling on Friday that most interpreted as ordering a halt to military activities in Rafah, while the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as leaders of Hamas.\n\nThe fighting in Rafah has made it difficult for humanitarian groups to import and distribute aid to southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing since the start of its operation, but aid groups say it's difficult to access that aid on the Gaza side because of the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. says it has only been able to collect aid from around 170 trucks over the past three weeks via Kerem Shalom. Smaller amounts of aid are entering through two crossings in the north and by sea through a U.S.-built floating pier.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas

It came hours after seven people were killed in an Israeli attack in Tel al-Sultan area in the city.\n\nThe fatalities occurred after at least 45 people in an Israeli strike on a tent encampment in Tel al-Sultan area in the city late Saturday.\n\nThe media office urged the International Criminal Court (ICJ) to pursue Israeli war criminals involved in the killing of tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza.\n\nIsrael expanded its ground offensive in Rafah on Tuesday, with its tanks reaching the center of the city.\n\nIsrael's current expansion of its incursion into the city makes the Israeli army close to fully control the border area between Gaza and Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, a demilitarized buffer zone running along the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nThe Israeli army has so far seized control of almost two-thirds of the corridor area as it advances under heavy bombardment and shelling.\n\nIsrael has continued its brutal offensive on the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, 2023 following a Hamas attack despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the enclave.\n\nNearly 36,100 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority being women and children, and over 81,000 others injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of \"genocide\" at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.\n\n*Writing by Mohammad Sio -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com",

As of Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the Israeli military told Reuters that officials were \"not aware of this incident.\" But witnesses told Reuters they spotted Israeli tanks and armored vehicles with machine guns in central Rafah. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday afternoon that American officials had not yet been able to verify those reports.\n\nThe latest reported incident comes after the Sunday bombing of a tent camp in western Rafah that killed at least 45 people. Harrowing videos from the scene that circulated on social media showed fire engulfing the tents and charred bodies being pulled from the flames. In one video, an adult is seen holding up what appeared to be a toddler missing multiple body parts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Sunday incident the result of \"a tragic mishap\" but offered no signs of slowing down Israel's assault on Rafah. The Israeli military said the strike killed two senior Hamas militants.\n\nThose explanations were insufficient for several world leaders and humanitarian groups. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the attacks, which he said \"killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict.\"\n\n\"There is no safe place in Gaza,\" Guterres added. \"This horror must stop.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" by the Sunday attacks and that \"these operations must stop.\"\n\nThe International Rescue Committee also condemned the attacks and alleged they violated international humanitarian law.\n\nAmerican officials have been comparatively more muted, with some wondering how Sunday's attack would square with President Biden's pronouncement earlier this month that he would stop sending weapons to Israel if it proceeded with a major ground invasion in Rafah. (That threat quickly proved meaningless, given that the Biden administration announced last week it was beginning a process to attempt to send another $1 billion in weapons to Israel.)\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Biden does not appear to have publicly addressed the deadly attacks on civilians in and near Rafah's tent camps. A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At Tuesday's press conference, reporters pressed Miller, the State Department spokesperson, for more clarity on what actions by Israel, exactly, would constitute Biden's so-called red line that would lead him to stop sending weapons.\n\n\"Is there actually a red line?\" one reporter asked. \"Do you have a yardstick by which you measure a red line that Israel may cross?\"\n\nMiller responded by referring to comments that National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had made last week in which Sullivan said \"there's no mathematical formula.\"\n\n\"What we're going to be looking at,\" Sullivan said last week, \"is whether there is a lot of death and destruction from this operation or if it is more precise and proportional.\"\n\nToday, reporters at the State Department briefing sought a clearer answer.\n\n\"So in theory,\" the reporter who asked about the red line continued, \"Israel can strike anywhere, basically, and say, 'there are Hamas operatives?'\"\n\n\"I'm not going to deal with your theories,\" Miller replied. \"I'm going to deal with reality.\"\n\nMiller added that US officials would continue to monitor the situation in Gaza and that \"we will continue to impress to [Israel] the importance of conducting legitimate operations that go after Hamas in a way that minimizes civilian harm.\" He added that so far, Israel's attacks in and near Rafah are not \"on the scale\" of previous incursions they conducted earlier in the war, including in Khan Younis, which Israeli forces invaded in December and destroyed more than half of buildings, according to the Associated Press. Miller also said U.S. officials will push Israeli officials to investigate what led to the deadly Sunday strikes and make their findings public.\n\nThe US's continued support for Israel, despite the deepening humanitarian crisis, comes amid a series of international court developments seeking to hold Israel accountable for the devastation. Last week, the top U.N. court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, and International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. Earlier this year, the International Court of Justice also ruled that a case brought by South Africa alleging Israel is committing genocide in Gaza will go forward and that, in the meantime, Israel must take steps to prevent genocide and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nDespite all this, Biden continues to have Bibi's back. The State Department has also come under fire from humanitarian aid groups after concluding in a delayed report released earlier this month that Israel was not restricting the flow of U.S. aid into Gaza, which more than 20 aid groups said was contrary to what their representatives had witnessed on the ground.\n\nBut as my colleague Noah Lanard has written, if Biden was serious about ending the war in Gaza, several concrete steps, including the restriction of arms transfers and military aid, are available to the president. In the meantime, as the past couple of days have shown, it's overwhelmingly Palestinian children and innocent civilians who are paying the price of Israel's war in Gaza.", "source": {"uri":

to Palestinian security sources and eyewitnesses.\n\nSecurity sources told Xinhua that Israeli tanks and troops reached the city center amid heavy gunfire and airstrikes covering the ground incursion.\n\nEyewitnesses said that they saw a group of Israeli soldiers walking towards the western area of Rafah, targeting anyone who walked in the areas they were entering.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's state-owned Kan TV reported that the army is continuing its operations in the Shaboura camp and Brazil neighborhood in the city, searching for tunnels, and trying to determine the locations of armed elements.\n\nIt indicated that Israeli army forces advanced west of Rafah towards the Philadelphia Corridor.\n\nAs a result, hundreds of families were displaced since the early hours of Tuesday morning from the western areas of the city in search of safe areas amid the violent air and artillery bombardment.\n\nOn May 7, the Israeli army announced the imposition of its control over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, located in the southern Gaza Strip on the border with Egypt, and in the eastern region of Rafah.\n\nIn addition, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said on social media platform X that nearly one million people were forced to flee from Rafah during the past three weeks, as a result of the Israeli bombing of the city.\n\nIt pointed out that the lack of food and water, the accumulation of piles of waste, and the unsuitable living conditions make assisting almost impossible day after day.\n\nSince Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a large-scale offensive against the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip, which has led to the death of more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health authorities, after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,200 Israelis, according to the Israeli authorities. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news",

AGENCY FOR GENDER EQUALITY\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The head of the United Nations agency promoting gender equality is demanding a halt to the war in Gaza, saying women and girls are suffering the most.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Tuesday more than 10,000 women have been killed in the seven months of fighting - including scores of women and children \"horrifically killed\" by an Israeli airstrike Monday while sleeping in tents in what was supposed to be a safe zone in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\n\nBahous told a U.N. Security Council meeting it is \"for all women and girls caught in this conflict that we demand a permanent cease-fire, unhindered humanitarian access, the release of all hostages, the determined pursuit of peace, and a two-state solution.\"\n\n\"This war must stop because women and girls are bearing the brunt of it,\" Bahous told the meeting on the role of women and youth in promoting international peace and security.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS FIRE IN RAFAH AIRSTRIKE WAS CAUSED BY SECONDARY BLAST\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says an initial investigation into a strike that sparked a deadly fire in a tent camp in the southern Gaza city of Rafah has found the blaze was caused by a secondary explosion.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said Tuesday that the military fired two 17-kilogram (37-pound) munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants. He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own and that the military is looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe strike or subsequent fire also could have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the densely populated tent camp housing displaced people.\n\nPalestinian health officials say at least 45 people, around half of them women and children, were killed in Sunday's strike.\n\nThe strike caused widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies.

That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a \"tragic mishap\" on Sunday and the military said it was investigating.\n\nThe latest strikes killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nNORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it \"a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.\"\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHowever, \"it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\" Barth Eide said. \"The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nLast week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nSPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE\n\nMADRID -- Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October's Hamas-led attack.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes\" and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRelations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah.\n\nIRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country's president and foreign minister.\n\nOf 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran's capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe State Department said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the Israeli airstrike on a displaced persons camp in Rafah that killed dozens of Palestinians on Sunday and prompted global outrage -- but US officials are waiting for an investigation before taking any action.\n\nGraphic videos and photos shared online from the aftermath of the strike showed a person appearing to be burned alive, bodies of women and children who had been burned, and a man holding up the body of a baby who had been seemingly decapitated.\n\nAt least 50 Palestinians were killed and dozens more injured in the attack that targeted an area filled with tents, many of which caught on fire, according to the Gaza health authorities.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that the US has reached out to Israel to demand an investigation and raise concerns.\n\n\"We are going to wait and see the full results of the investigation,\" he added.\n\nThe attack prompted immediate global condemnation from world leaders, aid groups and concerned citizens, while the White House has remained largely silent over the past few days.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons in Rafah.\"\n\n\"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\" he added, calling for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f2nio Guterres was similarly forceful in his response. \"I condemn Israel's actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict,\" he said on X. \"There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\"\n\nThe strike came just two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" in Rafah in a landmark emergency ruling that invoked the Genocide Convention.\n\nThe attack is likely to increase pressure on Mr Biden to reevaluate his support for Israel's war in Gaza, after vowing to withhold offensive weapons from the longtime US ally if it launched a major operation in Rafah.\n\nMr Biden has repeatedly expressed his strong opposition to a major offensive in Rafah, which had become the last refuge for more than a million Palestinians who had fled from the war raging in other parts of Gaza. It is also where most aid agencies are operating.\n\nIn a March interview with MSNBC, when asked whether an Israeli invasion of Rafah would be a red line for him, he replied: \"It is a red line but I'm never going to leave Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical.\"\n\nHis officials have repeatedly said the US would not support a \"major military operation\" in Gaza's southern city without a \"credible ... executable\" plan to protect civilians.\n\nMr Miller said Israel's operation in Gaza was not of the \"scale\" of previous operations that had prompted US concern, but he said the US was \"watching closely.\"\n\nVice president Kamala Harris did not comment when questioned if the attack breached Mr Biden's red line, but said: \"The word tragic doesn't even begin to describe it.\"\n\nThe Israeli army quickly claimed response for the attack on Sunday, claiming its air force had struck a Hamas compound with \"precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence,\" killing two Hamas officials in the process. But the next day, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a \"tragic mishap\" in an address to Israel's parliament and promised an investigation.\n\nThe Israeli army said Tuesday that it was investigating the possibility that a secondary explosion caused by weapons stored near where the strike occurred may have set tents ablaze.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

What did this innocent child do to deserve this?\" he asked.\n\nIsrael's government said on Monday it was looking into the \"grave and awful\" impact on Palestinian civilians of the previous night's strike.\n\nThe military said it had launched an investigation.\n\nThe Gaza war began after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.",

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here: joinsubtext.com/forbes.\n\nIsrael has faced international outrage since a strike Sunday that was targeting a Hamas compound ended up killing dozens of people in Rafah, including civilians. Netanyahu on Monday said the civilian deaths were a \"tragic accident,\" but assaults continued Tuesday, The New York Times reported. Another 21 people were reportedly killed after an airstrike on a \"humanitarian area\" in west Rafah, AFP reported, though the Israeli army has denied involvement.\n\nThe possibility of mass casualties in Rafah has been floated for months as Israel pushes to eliminate remaining outposts of Hamas, the militant group that attacked the country last October and sparked a bloody war in the Middle East. In February, Israeli officials said Rafah was the last place in Gaza with a powerful Hamas presence and announced its plans to move forward with attacks. Months of stop-and-start negotiations between the two sides followed, and delegates to Hamas and Israel met in Egypt for cease-fire talks that mediators hoped would end the war. After the attack in Rafah on Sunday, a Hamas official told Al Jazeera the group would not be participating in further Gaza truce talks. The Israeli military ordered evacuations of areas east of the city center, near Gaza's border with Israel, ahead of the Rafah offensive. The Tal al Sultan neighborhood that was later bombed was believed to be in a safe zone.\n\nLeaders around the world, including President Joe Biden, have criticized Israel for pursuing attacks in Rafah due to the more than 1 million civilians currently living there. Biden last month told CNN that while the United States would supply defensive arms to Israel, \"we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used\" for an attack in Rafah. The International Criminal Court confirmed last week that it is seeking arrest warrants for both Hamas and Israeli officials -- including Netanyahu -- for alleged war crimes, but the court has no way to enforce its own warrants even after they are issued.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sultan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66563336f99c2d93b7f65685/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1767,994,x0,y4,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605148", "eventUri": "eng-9605148", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

An Israeli military official said tanks were being used as part of what he called a limited and precise set of operations.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the country needed to start a ground invasion of Rafah to seek out the thousands of Hamas fighters and some leaders it says are based in the city, as well as some hostages. The plan has drawn international condemnation -- including from the U.S. -- even after Israel insisted it would first allow civilians to leave.\n\nThe United Nations says roughly one million civilians have fled Rafah, having sought shelter there during fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Devastation caused earlier in the near eight-month war means there are limited places for them to go, a predicament made clear on Sunday when an Israeli airstrike killed an estimated 45 Palestinians at a tent camp northwest of the city.\n\nIsrael said the attack was based on precise intelligence and that it killed two senior officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. Netanyahu called the incident a \"tragic mistake.\"\n\nAnother Israeli strike on Rafah on Tuesday killed 20 Palestinians, Gaza's civil defense service reported. The death toll from the war as a whole is now more than 36,000, according to officials in the Hamas-run enclave.\n\nRear Admiral Daniel Hagari, Israel's chief military spokesman, said an ongoing probe into the fire that killed 45 Gazans during the Sunday night airstrike suggests it was caused by a secondary explosion, possibly as a result of arms stored by Hamas in a separate structure.\n\nHe said the warplanes that killed the two Hamas commanders used the smallest munitions they have, and those alone couldn't have ignited the fire. He added that Hamas rocket launchers had been found some 43 meters away and Hamas has embedded itself in that part of Rafah among sheltering civilians since Oct. 7.\n\nHagari also played an intercepted phone call that he said was between two Gazans discussing the explosion and fire. One speaks of \"ammunition that started exploding\" and the other responds, \"This is an ammunition warehouse. I tell you it exploded. I mean, the Jewish bombing wasn't strong, it was a small missile because it didn't create a large hole.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nEgypt tunnels\n\nIsrael's military has found a number of tunnels from Rafah into Egypt and destroyed them, Hagari said, adding that Egypt was being kept informed.\n\nIsrael had pledged to invade Rafah while limiting civilian casualties, even as the city's population swelled to about 1.4 million mostly displaced people. The U.S. and other allies fear mass deaths, and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail plans for the assault.\n\nThe war has inflamed the region and led to widespread criticism of Israel. The International Court of Justice published a ruling on Friday that most interpreted as ordering a halt to military activities in Rafah, while the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as leaders of Hamas.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized a Palestinian state, in defiance of Israel's wishes.\n\nThe conflict began when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

Less than 30 hours after its first horrific massacre near the warehouses of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in the so-called \"safe zone\", Israel bombed displacement tents located in the vicinity of these same UNRWA facilities.\n\nThe Euro-Med Monitor field team documented the killing of seven civilians, including four women, after Israeli aircraft at dawn today (Tuesday 28 May), once again bombed displacement tents in the Tal Al-Sultan area, west of the city of Rafah. All victims were members of the Abu Jarad and Tanboura families. They had been forcibly displaced to the south after the Israeli army forced them to leave their homes in Gaza City and the Strip's northern parts. However, they were targeted by Israeli aerial bombardment in their displacement tents.\n\nThis new targeting took place in the same area where last Sunday night (26 May), Israeli aircraft bombed other displacement tents, killing 45 Palestinians, including three elderly people, nine children, and 12 women. The new targeting shows Israel's insistence on ignoring all international positions that denounced Sunday's massacre. Israel continues to commit the most heinous crimes against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip with the intention of eradicating them, in flagrant and egregious violation of international law and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rulings.\n\nIsrael's repeated targeting of displaced individuals who are supposed to be safe in tents and its recurrent bombing of the same location contradict the announcement made by Israeli officials that they are reviewing and investigating the rise in collateral casualties from the first massacre. According to these officials, the first massacre was justified as the intent was to kill leaders of Palestinian factions, and that what happened was an \"unfortunate mistake\".\n\nIn a separate incident, two staff members working at the Kuwait Specialised Hospital in Rafah were killed yesterday (Monday) after being targeted by Israeli drones at the hospital gate. The victims were identified as Rashid Barhoum, 23, and Musab Al-Arja, 22. The hospital's administration had announced earlier that the hospital was out of service due to the escalated Israeli military attacks on Rafah, the repeated and deliberate attacks on the hospital and its vicinity, and a recent deadly bombardment at its main gate.\n\nThe ICJ has ordered Israel to cease all operations in the Rafah Governorate, amid international demands to end the attack. Yet Israel is intensifying its ground incursion, accelerating the pace of aerial and artillery bombardment, and expanding its circle of killing and direct targeting of civilians -- an apparent response to the recent ICJ ruling.\n\nRafah has endured a brutal night of nonstop bombing, which forced thousands of people to flee under the shelling. Meanwhile, Israeli forces broke through and took up positions on the hill known as Za'roub, an historical site on the Palestinian-Egyptian border. They then started bulldozing and excavation work in in a cemetery next to the hill.\n\nMore than 82 Palestinians, including 18 women and 15 children, have been killed within less than 100 hours of the ICJ's Friday ruling to stop the Israeli military attack on Rafah. The attack has claimed the lives of 216 Palestinians so far, most of whom were women and children. This is not the final death toll, as it only includes those who were removed by rescue workers and medical teams from the targeted areas, while dozens of victims are still lying in the streets and trapped under the debris of destroyed homes with little hope of survival.\n\nIsrael's ongoing heinous acts against the displaced population in Rafah are further evidence of its blatant disregard for international law and the ruling of the International Court of Justice calling on it to immediately cease its attacks. The bombing, killing, and destruction intensified immediately after the session ended. Israeli officials have not held back in publicly rejecting the Court's ruling, either, calling it \"antisemitic\".\n\nCivilians in Rafah continue pay a heavy price for Israeli military attacks that flagrantly transgress international humanitarian law, particularly the principles of distinction, proportionality, and military necessity, i.e. taking appropriate precautions to avoid civilian deaths.\n\nAs a result of Israel's ongoing military attack on Rafah, the World Food Programme warehouse and the UNRWA distribution centre in Rafah remain inaccessible. Since taking control of the Rafah border crossing on 7 May, Israeli forces have prevented the entry of humanitarian aid through it (beginning the day before, on 6 May) and have continued to keep it closed to sick and injured people seeking to receive medical treatment abroad.\n\nEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor reiterates its call on all nations to fulfil their international obligations and halt all military, political, and financial support for Israel's military assault on the Gaza Strip. In particular, all arms transfers to Israel, including export permits and military assistance, must end immediately; otherwise, these nations will be considered complicit in Israeli crimes committed in the Strip, including genocide.\n\nFurthermore, Euro-Med Monitor urges the International Criminal Court (ICC) to acknowledge and handle Israel's crimes in the Gaza Strip as international crimes, as they fall under the Court's jurisdiction. Additionally, Euro-Med Monitor asks the Court to expand its lists of arrest warrants to include more Israeli officials. Israel is unambiguously committing genocide, an international crime that falls within the jurisdiction of the ICC", "source": {"uri": "reliefweb.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReliefWeb"},

Local eyewitnesses say they've reached a roundabout in the center of the city which forms a key landmark.\n\nImages and footages to emerge Tuesday have confirmed the advance of tank columns and IDF infantry deep into Rafah, which has sent thousands more displaced Palestinians fleeing from the Western half of the city, where the most intense fighting is happening.\n\nAdditionally BBC has observed of IDF tanks that overnight \"they also seized control of the highest hilltop along the Gaza-Egypt border after reported gun battles with Hamas-led fighters.\"\n\nAirstrikes have continued to increase in intensity on the Western outskirts, especially on the al-Faluja area which lies west of Jabalia camp.\n\nFollowing the Sunday bombing of a refugee tent camp in a designated safe zone which reportedly killed 45 people, there are emerging reports of another catastrophic air raid:\n\nThe air raid targeted al-Mawasi in western Rafah, an area where tents have been set up to house displaced Palestinians. It is also a designated humanitarian area to which Israeli authorities told Palestinians to flee.\n\n\"Among them are 13 females were killed. Israeli forces targeted another makeshift tent [area] where most of the people were women and children,\" Al Jazeera's Hind Khoudary said, reporting from Deir el-Balah.\n\nPressure out of Europe in particular is growing, amid ongoing EU discussions over possible sanctions against Israel and after last week's ICJ (World Court) call for immediate ceasefire, but so far the Netanyahu government is defiantly pushing forward its anti-Hamas operation.\n\nHamas has issued a statement meanwhile, as tanks plunge deeper into Rafah, calling on the UN Security Council to take \"practical and immediate measures\" to halt the invasion of Rafah city.\n\nThe statement said that the southernmost major city in Gaza \"is being subjected to indiscriminate barbaric Zionist bombing, affecting homes and tents of displaced people in various parts of the city.\"\n\n\"The UN Security Council is required to fulfill its legal and moral responsibilities in the face of the criminal Zionist entity's disregard for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which ordered an immediate halt to the aggression against the city,\" the Hamas statement added.\n\nThis comes a day after the White House appeared to justify Sunday's Israeli attack on the refugee encampment. A Biden national security spokesperson told CNN on Monday, \"The devastating images following the IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" the statement said. Axios has since reported:\n\nThe Biden administration is still assessing whether an Israeli strike that killed at least 45 displaced Palestinians at a tent camp in Rafah on Sunday is a violation of President Biden's \"red line,\" two U.S. officials told Axios.\n\nSo far the administration has stalled some ammo shipments, even while approving more massive defense aid packages and funding for Israel, in a largely symbolic move meant more for deflecting criticisms from Progressive Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [],

The Israeli military immediately denied it had carried out any attacks inside the zone. Videos verified by The New York Times show multiple people dead and injured in an agricultural region near the zone where people had been living in tents. The Gazan official, Dr. Mohammed Al Moghayer, of the Palestinian Civil Defense, said most of the dead and injured were taken to nearby field hospitals, and others to a hospital in the city of Khan Younis. The Times verified the location of the videos by matching footage of the aftermath to satellite imagery of the area, but could not verify whether an Israeli airstrike caused the damage.\n\nAround one million people have fled Rafah amid Israel's assault on the city in southern Gaza, according to the United Nations. The evacuation from Rafah, once the primary destination for people leaving other parts of the enclave, is the latest in a string of displacements since Israel launched a war to dismantle Hamas, the armed group that led the deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nChina joined a chorus of international voices in expressing \"serious concern\" about the Israeli military's actions in Rafah, citing an order by the International Court of Justice last week that appeared to call for Israel to halt its military offensive there. China \"opposes any violation of international law\" and \"strongly urges Israel to listen to the voice of the international community and stop attacking Rafah,\" said Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nA member of Egypt's security forces was killed near the Rafah border crossing with the Gaza Strip and an investigation is underway, an Egyptian army spokesman said on Monday, after the Israeli military reported a shooting on the border. Al Qahera News, Egypt's state-owned television station, cited an unnamed security official as saying it appeared there had been gunfire exchanged between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters, and that the ensuing battle resulted in the death of the soldier.

It is a phase that refers to the present genocide in Rafah, Gaza, with over 1.4 million Palestinians looking for shelter, alerted by the Iran's Embassy on X.\n\nDespite widespread global condemnation and an International Court of Justice (ICJ) mandate to cease its military operations, Israel continues to launch airstrikes in the region. In a significant but symbolic diplomatic development, Spain and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state on May 28, with Ireland expected to follow suit soon.\n\nApproximately half of Gaza's population, over a million people, have taken refuge in Rafah, the southernmost exit point from Gaza city, bordering Egypt's Sinai peninsula. Many have been forced to flee multiple times since Israel began a limited incursion earlier this month. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has stated that there is no safe place in Gaza, highlighting the dire humanitarian situation.\n\n1. Recent Airstrikes: Israel launched an attack on Rafah late Sunday following a Hamas rocket barrage aimed at Tel Aviv. At least 45 people were killed and 200 others injured in the Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced people. Israel's military claimed the strike targeted senior Hamas operatives but acknowledged civilian casualties, calling the incident a \"tragic mistake\".\n\n2. International Outrage: The attack has sparked global condemnation. The US National Security Council urged Israel to protect civilians, while former UK Prime Minister David Cameron called for a ceasefire to facilitate humanitarian aid. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have all condemned the attacks, citing violations of international law and war crimes.\n\n3. Mass Displacement: Since early May, around one million people have fled Rafah amid ongoing Israeli offensives. The UNRWA reports that these individuals face bombardments, inadequate living conditions, and a lack of food and water, with no safe haven in sight.\n\n4. Continued Military Operations: Despite international pressure, Israel has vowed to continue its operations in Rafah, focusing on eliminating Hamas fighters and infrastructure. Civilians have been advised to move to a designated humanitarian zone, although safety remains uncertain.\n\n5. ICJ Ruling: The ICJ has ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, adding to the diplomatic pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ruling emphasized the need to prevent conditions that could lead to the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n6. Social Media Response: The situation in Rafah has trended widely on social media, with various public figures expressing solidarity with Palestinians. Celebrities like Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Dia Mirza, and Swara Bhaskar have reshared posts condemning the attacks.\n\n7. Diplomatic Recognition: Spain and Norway recognized a Palestinian state on May 28, with Ireland expected to follow. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez emphasized the need for a viable Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel has condemned these recognitions, arguing they support Hamas.\n\n8. Israel's Response: Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, criticized the European countries' recognition of Palestine, accusing them of supporting terrorism.\n\n9. Conflict Background: The ongoing conflict was reignited by a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, which killed over 1,170 people and resulted in 252 hostages being taken. Israel's retaliatory strikes have led to over 36,050 deaths and 81,136 injuries in Gaza, according to local health authorities.\n\n10. Debate Over Palestinian Statehood: The conflict has revived discussions about Palestinian statehood. While Israel argues that an independent Palestinian state could compromise its security, many international actors believe that a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace.\n\nThe situation in Gaza remains highly volatile, with continued airstrikes, widespread displacement, and international diplomatic tensions. As the conflict persists, the humanitarian crisis deepens, underscoring the urgent need for a peaceful resolution.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors":

Those attacks and others have killed at least 723 health workers and injured another 924, per WHO's report.\n\nThe attacks have severely impacted health care workers' ability to treat people who desperately need medical treatment as Israel rains bombs on Gaza, blowing off children's limbs, burning displaced people alive, and destroying virtually all of Gaza's health and sanitation infrastructure. All the while, Israel has imposed a brutal blockade on humanitarian aid in the region, forcing millions of Palestinians to face imminent starvation and the rapid spread of disease in dangerously overcrowded and unsanitary displacement camps.\n\nNo hospital in Gaza is currently operating at full capacity, WHO reported. The Kuwait Hospital in Rafah, for example, was completely shut down on Monday after an Israeli airstrike near its entrance killed at least two health care workers.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Rafah also killed at least 45 Palestinians -- many of whom were children -- who were sheltering in a displacement camp in Rafah on Sunday. Another 249 were wounded, many critically, including people with severed limbs and severe burns. The strike occurred less than a mile from a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) medical facility.\n\n\"We are horrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe,\" the organization said in a social media post.\n\nWitnesses reported horrific scenes from the weekend's attacks, recounting charred bodies, a child who had been decapitated by the explosion, and a medic carrying a person whose brains had been blown out.\n\n\"We had to recover dismembered limbs and dead children,\" said Layan al-Fayoum, a young Palestinian teenager who survived the massacre.\n\nAbo Sebah, a resident of the displacement camp who fled central Gaza in January after Israeli forces killed three of his children and his grandchild, said the strike was aimed at furthering Israel's ethnic cleansing campaign, noting:\n\nWe have never seen any resistance fighters here. The fighters are in the combat zones in eastern Rafah. The Israelis just say these things to justify their actions. They want to kill the Palestinian people, forcibly expel them, and destroy their homes.\n\nEven amid international outcry over the massacre, Israeli forces appear to be intensifying their attacks in Rafah, as tanks have reportedly entered the city, nearing its center.\n\nIsrael's bloody siege of Rafah, which started earlier this month, has forced nearly a million Palestinians to flee once again after Israel lured them to the city under the pretense that it was a \"safe zone.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust,\" one resident told Reuters. \"It is death from God...The [Israelis] are hitting everywhere. We're tired.\"\n\nIsraeli forces have continued their attacks even after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to stop its assault on the city. Though the order is legally binding, the ICJ has no enforcement mechanism to force countries to abide by their decrees, and before the ruling was issued on Friday, Israeli leaders had said they would defy any order handed down by the international body.\n\nSince the start of Israel's genocidal bombing and starvation campaign in October, Israeli forces have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians in Gaza -- 15,000 of whom were children -- and injured over 80,000 others. The death toll is likely to be much higher than currently documented, as thousands of people are missing and presumed to be buried under the rubble.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_walker@truthout.org", "name": "Chris Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9decins_Sans_Fronti\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decapitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/05/2024_0528-healthcare-workers-gaza.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605148", "eventUri": "eng-9605148", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 330}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

On Sunday night, the Israeli military bombed civilians whom it had previously ordered to move to the designated \"safe zone\" of Tal Al-Sultan in the northwestern part of Rafah.\n\nIsrael has bombed Rafah dozens of times since the ICJ ruling. But on Sunday, the bombardment of Palestinians in a tent encampment behind the UNHCR school in Rafah resulted in a large inferno and massive casualties, including children who were burned alive in a sea of flames. According to Al Jazeera, the Israeli airstrikes struck the camp at night. The fire from the bombs falling on the plastic tents spread rapidly, killing at least 45 Palestinians, injuring 249, and razing the tent camp to the ground. This was reportedly followed by an Israeli drone strike on the Kuwaiti Hospital entrance as medics were bringing in the dead and the wounded, killing two staff members.\n\nHospital director Suhaib al-Hams announced on Monday that the Kuwaiti Hospital would have to suspend services due to \"the repeated and deliberate attacks on the hospital's surroundings.\"\n\nThe graphic images and cell phone video recordings that have been circulating on social media -- a headless child, charred bodies of children, women and children frantically running in all directions trying to escape the fires -- are painful to watch. They bring Israeli atrocities in Gaza to a new level of unspeakable cruelty and horror.\n\nI don't know how anyone can recover from this gruesome monstrosity. Do we mourn the dead infants or weep for those who have just been orphaned? Do we scream for those children who have been maimed, or for the parents who had to wrap their loved ones in white shrouds?\n\nIsraeli officials first said the strike was \"based on precise intelligence\" and claimed that the bombardment targeted a Hamas compound, killing two senior Hamas officials. After global condemnation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instead started calling the strike \"a tragic accident.\"\n\nThe U.S.-made bombs that were dropped on the camp in Tal Al-Sultan came after Israeli airstrikes hit shelters in northern Gaza and Gaza City, killing 160 displaced Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. In Jabalya, at least four people were reportedly killed when a missile hit a residential building during an intense night of shelling. Witnesses reported raging fires throughout the city. Elsewhere in the north, Israeli occupation forces continue to demolish residential neighborhoods, burying countless numbers of people under the rubble. Israeli soldiers were also seen firing on a group of Palestinians filling water containers in the Al-Faluja area.\n\nIsrael's Rafah massacre has been widely condemned as a grave violation of international law, but there has been no clear criticism or outrage from the White House. As the Biden administration emphasizes the deaths of Hamas leaders and utters the same words we've become accustomed to hearing over the past eight months -- that the U.S. urges Israel to protect civilians and minimize civilian casualties -- its statements have become a farce. The inaction on the part of the Biden administration and the continued flow of weapons to the Israeli state as it carries out such massacres in front of the eyes of the entire world -- and in defiance of the ICJ ruling -- show the extent of the U.S.'s complicity and participation in the Gaza genocide.\n\nI hold the U.S. government responsible for this carnage: For the siege, starvation and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza. For the mass destruction of hospitals, clinics, schools, universities, libraries, residential buildings, historic places and infrastructure. And for the total devastation of entire neighborhoods.\n\nBy singularly vetoing or abstaining from all United Nations Security Council ceasefire resolutions, the U.S. is the primary enabler of this harrowing nightmare inflicted on the Palestinian people who have lost everything several times over.\n\nWe've heard President Biden repeat debunked and unfounded claims that he saw photos of beheaded Israeli babies that did not exist - claims his own spokespeople had to walk back. Will silence be his reaction to the real image of a headless Palestinian child from one of Israel's bloodiest massacres to date? Why doesn't our president shed tears and speak up when he sees children being burned alive in their tents? How many more inhumane and barbarous acts will it take for the U.S. to end its \"unconditional\" financial, military and diplomatic support for the Israeli state?\n\nWe've been watching this horror day in and day out for almost eight months. The scenes of children crushed under tanks, sobbing mothers holding dead loved ones in their arms, and fathers digging sons and daughters from under the rubble leave me speechless.\n\nIsrael's genocidal practices in Gaza prompted numerous countries -- Bahrain, South Africa, Jordan, Turkey, Chile, Colombia, Chad, Honduras, and others -- to order their ambassadors to return home, sending the Israeli government a clear signal of outrage. Colombia's president Gustavo Petro has ordered the opening of an embassy in the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIn a phone call with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Japan's Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko told her Israeli counterpart that Tokyo wants to see an \"immediate ceasefire\" in Gaza. She added that the rulings of the ICJ are binding under international law and must \"be observed in good faith.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" by the strikes. Similarly, Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief, called it \"horrifying.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territory wrote: \"The #GazaGenocide will not easily end without external pressure: Israel must face sanctions, justice, suspension of agreements, trade, partnership and investments, as well as participation in int'l forums.\"\n\nDoctors Without Borders (also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res) called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and expressed horror at the massacre, saying it \"shows once again that nowhere is safe.\"\n\nThere are estimated to be around 1.5 million Palestinians stranded in Rafah, the southernmost part of the Gaza Strip close to Egypt's border, after having been displaced from northern Gaza and Gaza City and pushed there by the Israeli occupation forces to the so-called designated safe zone. In addition to being deprived of food, water and medical aid, they live in unimaginable daily fear of dying as bombs rain down on them from the air, from the sea and from the ground.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Spain, Ireland and Norway -- the three European nations that have just joined the list of 143 countries in recognizing the State of Palestine -- strongly condemned the Sunday massacre and urged Israel to abide by the order of the World Court and stop its assault on Rafah.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews.\"\n\nIn retaliation against Spain, Ireland and Norway's announcement, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he will stop transferring tax funds to the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israel has collected taxes on behalf of Palestinians for decades, as a result of agreements signed in the 1990s, and transfers that revenue to the PA each month. A halt of the transfer of such tax revenues will cause severe hardship for the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.\n\nIn another retaliatory measure in the wake of the ICJ ruling, the Israeli parliament will vote this week on designating UNRWA, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, as a terrorist organization. The aim is to sever all ties with the largest relief agency that provides health and educational services to 5.9 million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, as well as in refugee camps elsewhere in the Middle East.\n\nThe author of this bill, Yulia Malinovsky of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, wrote in the introduction: \"The purpose of this bill is to declare UNRWA as a terrorist organization for all intents and purposes as well as order the termination of the relations [and the cooperation] of the State of Israel with the agency, either directly or indirectly.\"\n\nIsraeli officials have openly said they want to destroy UNRWA and stop it from providing services to millions of Palestinian refugees. In January, they accused the UN relief agency of harboring members who were involved in the October 7 Hamas attack, but they were unable to back up their accusation with hard evidence. It was later revealed by Reuters that an UNRWA report concluded that Israel coerced some agency employees to falsely admit Hamas links. As a result, most countries -- except for the U.S., U.K., Lithuania, the Netherlands and Austria -- have by now reinstated their funding to UNRWA that was cut off when Israel made its false accusation.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza. Hamas killed nearly 1,200 Israelis on October 7 and took 250 hostages. As of May 2024, hostages still held by Hamas number 132, while Israel has 3,424 Palestinian administrative detainees held in its prisons without charge or trial. According to an Egyptian official, the stalled ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to resume in Cairo this week.\n\nIt's hard to fathom how journalists such as New York Times guest columnist James Kirchick can still be arguing this week that \"One of the greatest mass delusions of the 21 century is the belief that Israel is committing a genocide against Palestinians.\" But at least some segments of the U.S. mainstream appear to finally be grappling with the horror of the current genocide. Aryeh Neier, Jewish co-founder of Human Rights Watch, and former head of the ACLU, was recently invited to speak on CNN about the conclusion that he offered in his New York Review of Books article: that Israel is attempting genocide in its assault on Gaza.\n\nEven as I write this, Israel continues to pound Rafah with artillery shelling causing more Palestinian deaths and wounding scores of civilians. Biden has invoked an Israeli invasion of Rafah as a red line in the past, one that would lessen the flow of U.S. weapons to Israel. Hasn't that red line been crossed? People of conscience worldwide are calling for an end to genocide. Isn't it time for the U.S. to end its own complicity?", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michel_moushabeck@truthout.org", "name":

An estimated 45 people were killed in the attack, which struck a cluster of tents sheltering displaced Palestinians.\n\n\"It is deeply disappointing to see President Biden continue to allow Israel to operate with impunity,\" said Ahmad Abuznaid, director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR).\n\n\"To issue a red line that you knew you weren't going to follow through on not only means he will continue to be Genocide Joe, but it also just shows he's weak politically.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Washington justified its failure to hold Israel to account by arguing that the offensive in Rafah was a \"limited\" operation, not the all-out assault that Biden had cautioned against.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated that position on Tuesday, despite Sunday's bloodshed and Israeli tanks pushing deeper into Rafah.\n\n\"We do not want to see major military operations take place there, the way that we saw them take place in Khan Younis and in Gaza City. At this point, we have not seen a military operation on the scale of those previous operations,\" Miller said.\n\nHe added that the US could not \"verify\" that Israeli military vehicles are in central Rafah, which has been confirmed by Palestinian witnesses and Israeli media outlets.\n\nPalestinian rights advocates argue that the Biden administration is redefining what it considers to be an invasion of Rafah in order to be able to deny that an offensive is happening.\n\nYasmine Taeb, the legislative and political director for the advocacy group MPower Change Action, called Biden's red line on Rafah \"absolutely meaningless and merely a continuation of his callous and indefensible Gaza policy\".\n\n\"Israel is in violation of international humanitarian law, as well as US laws and policies, but nearly eight months of carnage in Gaza has apparently still not been enough for Biden to finally take a principled and consistent position by enforcing US laws and immediately suspending arms to Israel,\" Taeb told Al Jazeera.\n\nIsrael followed Sunday's bombing with another attack near Rafah on Tuesday that claimed the lives of at least 21 displaced Palestinians.\n\nMohamad Habehh, the director of development at American Muslims for Palestine, also called Biden's \"red line\" meaningless.\n\n\"The Biden administration has failed to hold Israel accountable since October. We're now in the eighth month of this. And we're seeing that new massacre every single day,\" Habehh told Al Jazeera.\n\nEarlier this month, the US withheld a single shipment of heavy bombs to Israel, citing disagreements over Rafah. The move raised rights advocates' hopes that Washington may finally be reconsidering its unconditional support for Israel.\n\nThat optimism soon dissipated after several US officials stressed \"ironclad\" support to Israel and the Biden administration approved the transfer of $1bn in weapons to its ally.\n\nIsrael receives at least $3.8bn in US military aid annually, and last month, Biden signed off on $14bn in additional assistance to the country.\n\nThe Center for International Policy (CIP), a US-based think tank, renewed calls for withholding weapons to Israel after the deadly attack on Sunday.\n\n\"The mass killing of civilians seeking refuge, whether by mistake or otherwise, is exactly what President Biden said would be unacceptable about an Israeli offensive in Rafah,\" Dylan Williams, CIP's vice president for government affairs, said in a statement.\n\n\"Biden shouldn't wait for a pro forma Israeli investigation -- he should stand by his word and halt arms right now.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the attack as a \"tragic mistake\" and promised an investigation.\n\nAt Tuesday's State Department news briefing, Miller also called the massacre \"heartbreaking\", but he attributed it to a \"fire\" rather than to Israeli bombardment. He said that Washington will be following the Israeli investigation closely.\n\nBut Habehh said citing Israel's investigations is a tactic the US uses to deflect responsibility, allowing it to indefinitely delay making an assessment on rights violations.\n\nEssentially, Habehh explained, that gives the US time to wait for stories of Israeli atrocities to \"die out\".\n\n\"It's very hard to allow the person who committed the crime to investigate whether or not they committed it,\" Habehh told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs the horrors in Gaza intensify, advocates say it is becoming apparent that the Biden administration has no plans of changing course despite issuing statements against the invasion of Rafah and calling for the protection of civilians.\n\n\"Maybe Biden's concerns for the Palestinians have floated away along with the port that they were building along the coast of Gaza,\" Abuznaid said, referring to a marine hub Washington built to deliver aid to the territory, which was damaged by high tide in recent days.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_harb@aljazeera.com", "name": "Ali Harb",

(WAFA) - The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres today condemned the Israeli deadly airstrikes on the tent sheltering displaced people in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah.\n\nGuterres decried in a press release in the strongest terms the 26 May Israeli airstrikes on Rafah hitting tents sheltering displaced people, and noted that he was \"heartbroken by the images of the killed and injured, including many small children.\"\n\n\"As he has said before, the horror and suffering must stop immediately,\" the release said.\n\nThe Secretary-General reiterated his demand for an immediate ceasefire, and recalled \"the recent orders of the International Court of Justice, which are binding and must be complied with.\"\n\nHe urged Israel, the occupying power, to \"allow, facilitate and enable the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian supplies assistance to those in need, and to open all border crossings.\n\nHe stressed the need for \"take]ing[ urgent steps that will enable the parties to re-engage on the long-delayed political path to achieve a two-State solution.\"\n\nIsraeli warplanes today struck the al-Mawasi area near Rafah, which had been designated a \"humanitarian zone\" by the occupation forces, with several missiles, killing at least 21 people and wounding others, mostly children and women.\n\nWithin the last 48 hours, the occupation forces killed 72 displaced people in bombing that targeted the tents housing the displaced people in the Israeli designated \"safe zone\".\n\nTuesday's strikes follows Sunday's widely condemned Israeli attack on the camps of the displaced people in Rafah, which killed at least 45 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and wounded some 250 others.\n\nTuesday's airstrikes came just four days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel in a legally binding decision to halt its military offensive in Rafah, which may violate its obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nTried before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7, killing at least 36,096 Palestinians and injuring over 81,136 others.\n\nMoreover, at least 7,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the

The photos the agency obtained show the tail of a GBU-39/B small-diameter bomb, which is made by Boeing. The GBU-39/B includes a jet engine taken from the M26 unguided missile.\n\nThousands of civilians had been sheltering in the Tal as-Sultan area, seeking some minimal protection from the continuous Israeli attacks across Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli government had not issued any orders to evacuate the area before it attacked.\n\nIsrael killed at least 45 people in the offensive.\n\nThe total number of injured people is hard to determine, as the hospital where casualties were taken has closed after a subsequent Israeli drone attack on its entrance that killed two members of staff.\n\nSome people \"reportedly burned to death\", according to Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\n\nAccounts from Rafah say that many of the dead were preparing to go to sleep when the attack occurred.\n\nInitially, the Israeli army claimed it had struck \"a Hamas compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating\".\n\nIt added it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed\".\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since said the attack was \"a tragic mistake.\"\n\n\"Despite our best effort not to harm those not involved, unfortunately a tragic error happened last night. We are investigating the case,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe attack came two days after the ICJ ordered Israel to halt its offensive on Rafah.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is set to convene an emergency meeting over the attack on Rafah.\n\nTo date, the United States has vetoed every UNSC proposal aimed at holding Israel accountable.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Taliban offensive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precision-guided munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-27-at-11.55.06\u202fAM-1716809522.png?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605148", "eventUri": "eng-9605148", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 840, "textEnd": 846}], "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Mohammad al-Mughayyir confirmed the casualties, stating the strike targeted tents housing displaced individuals. Hamas has reported that the attack led to \"dozens of martyrs and wounded.\"\n\nThe incident follows an earlier airstrike in the southern Gaza city that killed 45 people, drawing international condemnation. Israeli tanks have advanced into Rafah, with eyewitnesses noting their presence in central areas, including the Al-Awda roundabout. Local security sources confirm that the ground assault, initiated earlier this month, has continued despite the backlash.\n\nAbdel Khatib, a Rafah resident, described the dire situation: \"People are currently inside their homes because anyone who moves is being shot at by Israeli drones.\" The Israeli military, however, denied targeting the displacement camp, claiming no strikes were conducted in the designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.\n\nThe escalation has intensified ahead of an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting set to address the recent violence. Israel's military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, contested claims regarding the cause of a deadly fire from the previous strike, attributing it to factors beyond their munitions.\n\nThe global community has reacted strongly, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres declaring, \"There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu labeled the incident a \"tragic accident\" but affirmed the continuation of efforts to dismantle Hamas and rescue hostages.\n\nOvernight bombardments continued across Gaza, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, highlighted the severe conditions, reporting mass displacement and critical shortages of essential supplies. Residents like Faten Jouda expressed fears for their safety amidst relentless bombings, with many seeking refuge in designated safe zones.\n\nThe ongoing conflict, triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7, has claimed over 36,000 lives in Gaza, primarily civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. The Israeli military maintains that its operations target Hamas militants, noting the deaths of two senior Hamas members in recent strikes.\n\nThe violence has spurred political moves, with Ireland, Norway, and Spain formally recognizing the State of Palestine, a significant gesture amidst growing calls for peace and a two-state solution. However, Israel criticized these actions as endorsing Hamas, recalling its diplomats from the three countries.\n\nInternational figures, including EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell and French President Emmanuel Macron, have expressed deep concern over the humanitarian impact, calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He did not directly address a question from a reporter about whether tanks had moved into Rafah's center, saying that Hamas battalions remained in the city and that Israeli forces were operating in a \"targeted\" way.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Israeli military said its troops were operating in the Rafah area, engaging in close-quarters combat, \"as efforts are continuing to be made in order to prevent harm to uninvolved civilians in the area.\"\n\nChina expressed \"serious concern\" about the Israeli military's actions in Rafah, citing an order by the International Court of Justice last week that appeared to call for Israel to stop its military offensive there. China \"opposes any violation of international law\" and \"strongly urges Israel to listen to the voice of the international community and stop attacking Rafah,\" said Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBut the wording of the court's order -- which called on Israel to immediately halt any actions in Rafah, \"which may inflict upon the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that would bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\" -- was ambiguous. Israeli officials have argued that the ruling allowed it to continue fighting in Rafah because the military would not inflict such conditions.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Turkish_offensive_into_north-eastern_Syria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mao Zedong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/20/world/2024-05-28-rafah-strike-promo/2024-05-28-rafah-strike-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605148", "eventUri": "eng-9605148", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

response to the fire, said on Monday \"rescue and retrieval operations concluded last night, while efforts to extinguish the fire continued for 45 minutes\".\n\nHe said battling the inferno was made even more difficult because of fuel and water shortages.\n\n\"We also saw cases of amputations, injured children, women, and elderly among the dead,\" he added.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians who had sought shelter in the area after being told by the Israelis to evacuate their homes were shocked when the camp was targeted.\n\n\"They dropped leaflets asking us to go to the humanitarian zone in Tal

destruction.\n\nMughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impacts of Israel's siege on the territory amid the over seven-months-old conflict.\n\n\"There is a fuel shortage ... there are roads that have been destroyed, which hinders the movement of civil defence vehicles in these targeted areas,\" he said. \"There is also a shortage of water to extinguish fires.\"\n\nEgypt deplored the \"targeting of defenceless civilians\" and labelled it part of \"a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable\".\n\nJordan also expressed its condemnation, accusing Israel of committing \"ongoing war crimes\".\n\nKuwait charged the attack exposed Israel's \"blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world\".\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,984 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian territory's health ministry.\n\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war and the spiralling civilian death toll have sparked a growing global backlash against Israel, including cases before two international courts in The Hague. -- AFP", "source": {"uri":

at least 45 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and wounded some 250 others.\n\nTuesday's airstrikes came just four days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel in a legally

A woman stroked a dead boy's forehead as planes rumbled overhead.\n\n'People were sleeping peacefully,' said neighbour Abu Mohammed Ziyadah.\n\n'As you can see, there were no militants, not even male adults, except for the head of the family. They were all women and children.'\n\nSoon after the war in Gaza began on October 7, Israel told Palestinians living in the north of Gaza to move to 'safe zones' in the territory's south such as Rafah.\n\nBut Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since vowed to invade the city, where around 1.5 million people -- more than half the territory's population -- are sheltering.\n\nIsrael has for two months threatened to send troops in against Hamas militants, but even without such an operation Rafah is under regular bombardment.\n\nBassal said the Israeli army struck several areas in Rafah overnight, including Salam neighbourhood where one person was killed and several wounded. He said the army hit a house and a nursery school.\n\n'It has been a very hard night on Rafah,' he said.\n\nIn the north of the occupied West Bank, the Israeli army said Saturday troops had killed 10 militants in an ongoing raid around Nur Shams, a refugee camp.\n\nAFP journalists heard gunshots and saw houses hit by blasts as Israeli drones flew overhead and armoured vehicles moved through the camp.\n\nSince early last year, violence has flared in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. It has escalated further since war broke out in Gaza on October 7.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said it had confirmed 11 wounded in the Israeli raid, seven of them 'wounded by live gunshots'. It said a paramedic shot while trying to get to the wounded was among them.\n\nThe health ministry said medics had been alerted to 'a number of killed and injured' inside the camp, but said the army was 'denying them access to tend to the wounded'.\n\nAn AFP journalist said paramedics had tried to enter the camp but had been refused access by the army.\n\nIsraeli forces say their frequent raids target Palestinian militants, but civilians are often among the dead.\n\nOn Friday the health ministry said 16-year-old Qais Fathi Nasrallah was killed by Israeli troops in the nearby Tulkarem refugee camp.\n\nThe official Palestinian news agency Wafa said he died after being 'shot in the head by Israeli live gunfire'. It was unclear exactly when he died.\n\nA 30-year-old man, Salim Faisal Ghanem, was 'killed by Israeli troops' on Friday in the Nur Shams camp, Wafa said.\n\nResidents contacted by AFP on Saturday said there was no electricity in the camp and food was running short, saying nobody was allowed to enter or leave.\n\nMinister Muayad Shaaban, head of the Palestinian Colonisation and Wall Resistance Commission, said residents were suffering from the 'destruction of homes, shops, the electricity grid, the sewerage, the water network and infrastructure.'\n\nAround 480 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in the West Bank since the Hamas assault on Israel triggered the Gaza war, according to Palestinian official sources.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType":

red lines have repeatedly shifted when it comes to Israel's assault on Rafah, but the US president faces growing pressure to firm up his stance after a deadly strike in the Gazan city.\n\nGlobal outrage erupted after the Israeli attack that killed 45 people in a camp for displaced people on Sunday, despite repeated calls by Washington for its key ally Israel to do more to protect civilians as it pursues its war against Hamas.\n\nFacing US campus protests and a tough reelection battle, Biden said earlier this month that he would not supply Israel with weapons for a major invasion of Rafah, and he halted a shipment of bombs.\n\nBut the White House has kept its red line on what constitutes such an offensive deliberately vague, even as Israel steps up attacks and, as of Tuesday, pushed tanks into central Rafah.\n\n\"There's no mathematical formula,\" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said last week.\n\n\"What we're going to be looking at is whether there is a lot of death and destruction from this operation or if it is more precise and proportional.\"\n\nBiden would likely try to continue that balancing act as long as possible amid a generally \"inchoate\" policy on the conflict, said Colin Clarke, Director of Research at the Soufan Group.\n\n\"Biden wants to appear tough on Rafah, and has really tried to be stern with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, but in an election year, his red lines are increasingly blurred,\" Clarke told AFP.\n\n\"I think he'll continue shifting those lines, ducking and weaving, largely in response to events on the ground.\"\n\nFor now, Washington gave no sign it had changed its mind despite horrifying scenes of what witnesses said were charred and mutilated bodies, including those of children, at the scene of the Rafah camp strike.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told reporters on Tuesday that \"the word tragic doesn't even begin to describe it\" but didn't respond when asked if it crossed the US line.\n\n- 'Genuinely empathizes' -\n\nUS officials were still assessing what had happened in what Netanyahu called a \"tragic accident.\" Israel's military says it targeted two senior Hamas militants and insisted Tuesday its munitions alone could not have caused the blaze that killed the civilians.\n\nThe White House gave a muted reaction on Monday saying that while Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\" it was still \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military to figure out what went on.\n\nBut internationally the pressure is growing on Biden, a self-described Zionist who has stuck by Netanyahu despite deep disagreements since the war began with the October 7 Hamas attack.\n\nQuestions are mounting over how long the United States can tolerate an Israeli assault on Rafah when the International Court of Justice -- the UN's top court, of which both the US and Israel are members -- ordered it to stop.\n\nPolitical pressure is also mounting on Biden at home in a year when the 81-year-old faces a bitter election rematch with former president Donald Trump.\n\nProtests against his support for Israel have roiled university campuses across the United States, while many on the left wing of his Democratic Party also oppose his stance.\n\nRepublicans however have assailed Biden over what they say is his faltering support for Israel, with US House Speaker Mike Johnson inviting Netanyahu to address Congress.\n\n\"I think in his heart of hearts, Biden wants to end the Israeli siege of Rafah because he genuinely empathizes with the suffering of the Palestinian people,\" added Clarke.\n\nBut with US cabinet members pushing for a wider deal for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel \"he's got to keep an open line with Netanyahu and his inner circle, even if it pains him.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_kemp@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Danny

She had no features at all because shrapnel tore off her face,\" Hamad said.\n\nZionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday the strike was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament.\n\nThe Zionist military had said earlier that its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\" on Sunday night, killing two senior officials of the Palestinian militant group in the occupied West Bank. The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate's Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes.\n\nFootage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated.\n\n\"When these rockets fall on a tower block there are dozens of martyrs, so what about when they are tents?\" lamented a man called Hamad. \"When we heard the sound (of the explosion), the sky suddenly lit up,\" displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness, told AFP. \"We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs as a result of the use of (...) missiles that caused a massive fire,\" the director of Gaza's civil defense agency, Mohammad al-Mughayyir, said.\n\nMughayyir, who oversaw the response to the fire, said on Monday \"rescue and retrieval operations concluded last night, while efforts to extinguish the fire continued for 45 minutes\". He said battling the inferno was made even more difficult because of fuel and water shortages. \"We also saw cases of amputations, injured children, women, and elderly among the dead,\" he added.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians who had sought shelter in the area after being told by the Zionists to evacuate their homes were shocked when the camp was targeted. \"They dropped leaflets asking us to go to the humanitarian zone in Tal al-Sultan, so we complied and came here,\" Abu Muhammad, who was displaced from north Gaza five months ago, told AFP. \"But yesterday when I was having dinner at sunset, suddenly it felt like there was an earthquake -- the ground shook violently,\" he said.\n\nMohammed Abu Qamar, 27, said he was equally baffled by the strikes, after he too moved from north Gaza to the camp that had been labelled a \"safe zone\" by the Zionists authorities. \"Yesterday evening, to our surprise, the camp was bombarded with rockets in this supposedly safe place,\" he told AFP on Monday. \"A fire broke out, and children, women, and old people were burned.\"\n\nAt the Tel Al-Sultan Clinic, body bags of white sheeting lay on the floor of a room before the dead were taken away for burial in pickup trucks. \"She was seven months pregnant ... her room was bombed,\" Ahmad Miqdad told AFP in tears at the clinic.\n\nHis only sister, Yasmine, was killed in the strike and her body could not be recovered because it was blown to pieces in the explosion, he said. \"She was preparing to welcome her new baby.

41 Yakima", "body": "Joe Biden's red lines have repeatedly shifted when it comes to Israel's assault on Rafah, but the US president faces growing pressure to firm up his stance after a deadly strike in the Gazan city.\n\nGlobal outrage erupted after the Israeli attack that killed 45 people in a camp for displaced people on Sunday, despite repeated calls by Washington for its key ally Israel to do more to protect civilians as it pursues its war against Hamas.\n\nFacing US campus protests and a tough reelection battle, Biden said earlier this month that he would not supply Israel with weapons for a major invasion of Rafah, and he halted a shipment of bombs.\n\nBut the White House has kept its red line on what constitutes such an offensive deliberately vague, even as Israel steps up attacks and, as of Tuesday, pushed tanks into central Rafah.\n\n\"There's no mathematical formula,\" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said last week.\n\n\"What we're going to be looking at is whether there is a lot of death and destruction from this operation or if it is more precise and proportional.\"\n\nBiden would likely try to continue that balancing act as long as possible amid a generally \"inchoate\" policy on the conflict, said Colin Clarke, Director of Research at the Soufan Group.\n\n\"Biden wants to appear tough on Rafah, and has really tried to be stern with (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, but in an election year, his red lines are increasingly blurred,\" Clarke told AFP.\n\n\"I think he'll continue shifting those lines, ducking and weaving, largely in response to events on the ground.\"\n\nFor now, Washington gave no sign it had changed its mind despite horrifying scenes of what witnesses said were charred and mutilated bodies, including those of children, at the scene of the Rafah camp strike.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told reporters on Tuesday that \"the word tragic doesn't even begin to describe it\" but didn't respond when asked if it crossed the US line.\n\n- 'Genuinely empathizes' -\n\nUS officials were still assessing what had happened in what Netanyahu called a \"tragic accident.\" Israel's military says it targeted two senior Hamas militants and insisted Tuesday its munitions alone could not have caused the blaze that killed the civilians.\n\nThe White House gave a muted reaction on Monday saying that while Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\" it was still \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military to figure out what went on.\n\nBut internationally the pressure is growing on Biden, a self-described Zionist who has stuck by Netanyahu despite deep disagreements since the war began with the October 7 Hamas attack.\n\nQuestions are mounting over how long the United States can tolerate an Israeli assault on Rafah when the International Court of Justice -- the UN's top court, of which both the US and Israel are members -- ordered it to stop.\n\nPolitical pressure is also mounting on Biden at home in a year when the 81-year-old faces a bitter election rematch with former president Donald Trump.\n\nProtests against his support for Israel have roiled university campuses across the United States, while many on the left wing of his Democratic Party also oppose his stance.\n\nRepublicans however have assailed Biden over what they say is his faltering support for Israel, with US House Speaker Mike Johnson inviting Netanyahu to address Congress.\n\n\"I think in his heart of hearts, Biden wants to end the Israeli siege of Rafah because he genuinely empathizes with the suffering of the Palestinian people,\" added Clarke.\n\nBut with US cabinet members pushing for a wider deal for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel \"he's got to keep an open line with Netanyahu and his inner circle, even if it pains him.\"\n\ndk/dw\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 41 Tri Cities

On Sunday, an airstrike hit a mass of tents in the city, reportedly killing 45 people. On Tuesday, Reuters reported witness testimony that \"tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machine guns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque\" in central Rafah.\n\nYet as of this week, Axios reported that the White House is \"still assessing\" whether the red line had been crossed, and at the time of writing the weapons had not been cut off. I ask: What else is there to assess? Do they think they could be someone else's tanks? (Perhaps Bugs Bunny got lost taking his armored regiment to Palm Springs.)\n\nMore from Ryan Cooper\n\nThe Guardian also reported Tuesday that Yossi Cohen, former head of the Israeli spy agency Mossad, \"allegedly threatened a chief prosecutor of the international criminal court in a series of secret meetings in which he tried to pressure her into abandoning a war crimes investigation.\"\n\nWhat more is it going to take for Biden to stop enabling this rogue state?\n\nIt should be emphasized that the Rafah attack was no outlier. From the very start of the campaign, \"the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy,\" to quote Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, from back in October. And it was only a few weeks ago that Israeli forces killed several World Central Kitchen aid workers, including an American citizen, with repeated precision airstrikes.\n\nIn international law, there is an important distinction between collateral damage -- civilians killed by accident in a conflict -- and deliberately killing civilians because you claim there might be a military target among them. That is a war crime. Stopping shipments of food and medical supplies -- in an obvious, undisguised attempt to create famine in Gaza, which Israel has been doing for months -- is also a war crime.\n\nYet this has been the story of the Biden administration and the war in Gaza. Biden makes some timid requests for Israeli forces to cool it a little bit; Netanyahu spits in his face, blows up another hospital, and then demands more free weapons.\n\nI'd argue that a true friend of Israel -- one who does not want it to end up as a North Korea-style pariah state -- would have long since put maximum pressure on it to end this war and accept a negotiated settlement with the Palestinians, either with their own state or as one state with equal rights for all. That's the only thing that will protect Israeli security in the long run.\n\nBut it seems Joe Biden is not such a friend.", "source": {"uri": "prospect.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American

It is just not acceptable,\" said Rippe.\n\nParis has supplied Israel with intelligence and military aid since it began its assault on Gaza in October, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians -- the majority of whom have been civilian men, women, and children. The carnage of innocent people has continued despite repeated Israeli claims that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) only targets Hamas fighters and is taking all necessary steps to protect civilians.\n\nAnadolu Agencyreported Tuesday that Paris police fired tear gas shells at protesters who attempted to proceed toward the Israeli embassy.\n\n\"We participate in this march, which is scheduled to reach the Israeli embassy to confirm and loudly say that we are all against what happened in Rafah,\" Carlos Martens Bilongo, a member of the French National Assembly, told Anadolu. \"Burning the tents of the displaced Palestinians is unacceptable, and France must move more politically to cease-fire in Gaza.\"\n\nAs protesters marched in Paris as well as in other European cities including Madrid and Barcelona, Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin told reporters after attending a European Union Foreign Affairs Council meeting that there \"was a very clear consensus about the need to uphold the international humanitarian legal institutions\" and that officials had for the first time engaged in \"significant\" discussions about possible sanctions on Israel.\n\nMartin noted that the foreign ministers had discussed sanctions if Israel does not comply with the International Court of Justice's latest ruling, in which the court ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah.\n\n\"There was a strong discussion on the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice,\" Martin told reporters, adding that offiicals had \"very clear views that Israel should adhere to those provisional orders to open the border crossing with Rafah and cease its military operations in Rafah.\"\n\n\"International humanitarian law, adherence to human rights, is the raison d'etre of the European Union and events now are really putting that issue into sharp focus, particularly given the attack last night when so many innocent people were killed,\" said Martin.\n\nIn the U.S., the Biden administration -- the largest international funder of the IDF -- said Monday that it was \"assessing\" whether Israel had crossed a \"red line\" by killing 45 displaced people. Biden has been the target of national and international outrage for continuing to support Israel despite mounting proof that the IDF is not protecting civilians and is operating with genocidal intent.\n\n\"When the history of this is written, it will document how some stood against these war crimes,\" said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, as French protesters stood against the Rafah attack. \"And how others supported, protected and abetted them.

Artificial intelligence will book you one Nations Fail to Agree on Treaty on Preventing Next Pandemic - 'Genuinely empathizes' -\n\nUS officials were still assessing what had happened in what Netanyahu called a \"tragic accident.\" Israel's military says it targeted two senior Hamas militants and insisted Tuesday its munitions alone could not have caused the blaze that killed the civilians.\n\nThe White House gave a muted reaction on Monday saying that while Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\" it was still \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military to figure out what went on.\n\nBut internationally the pressure is growing on Biden, a self-described Zionist who has stuck by Netanyahu despite deep disagreements since the war began with the October 7 Hamas attack.\n\nQuestions are mounting over how long the United States can tolerate an Israeli assault on Rafah when the International Court of Justice -- the UN's top court, of which both the US and Israel are members -- ordered it to stop.\n\nPolitical pressure is also mounting on Biden at home in a year when the 81-year-old faces a bitter election rematch with former president Donald Trump.\n\nProtests against his support for Israel have roiled university campuses across the United States, while many on the left wing of his Democratic Party also oppose his stance.\n\nRepublicans however have assailed Biden over what they say is his faltering support for Israel, with US House Speaker Mike Johnson inviting Netanyahu to address Congress.\n\n\"I think in his heart of hearts, Biden wants to end the Israeli siege of Rafah because he genuinely empathizes with the suffering of the Palestinian people,\" added Clarke.\n\nBut with US cabinet members pushing for a wider deal for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel \"he's got to keep an open line with Netanyahu and his inner circle, even if it pains him.\"\n\ndk/dw", "source": {"uri":

These questions focus on two main points: first, when will the war end, and second, what will the situation in the Gaza Strip be in the aftermath?\n\nA reading of the current situation clearly leads to the conclusion that there are negative developments in terms of the nature of the Israeli military operations in the Strip and positive developments in terms of regional and international movement towards the Palestinian cause. However, it is difficult to say which direction these developments will take, whether towards calm and appeasement or towards more tension and escalation.\n\nA number of developments bear on the current situation, which can be summarised as follows.\n\nIsraeli operations in the Gaza Strip are continuing, particularly in the northern area and specifically in the Breij and Jabalia Camps, as well as in the southern area, specifically in the city of Rafah. The Israeli army began to invade Rafah three weeks ago from east to west and including the occupation of the Palestinian Rafah Crossing and parts of the Salaheddin or Philadelphi Corridor. The latter lies entirely within the Palestinian territory, and the Israeli army did not heed the warnings against taking this step.\n\nThe US and Israeli positions on the Rafah operation are gradually converging, with this having been facilitated by the displacement of about one million Palestinian citizens from the city of Rafah to the central Gaza Strip. However, the city was not spared the massacres carried out by Israel in the Tel Al-Sultan Camps in Rafah on the evening of 26 May.\n\nThere has been an escalation of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip due to Israel's occupation of the Rafah Crossing, through which aid enters the Strip. Egypt has refused to accept the fait accompli that Israel tried to impose by occupying the crossing. However, the recent contact between US President Joe Biden and President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi has contributed significantly to finding temporary compromise solutions to the humanitarian crisis by bringing in Egyptian aid through the Kerem Shalom Crossing until an acceptable solution is reached to the problem of the Rafah Crossing.\n\nThere have been moves towards resuming negotiations between the parties concerned in order to reach a humanitarian truce in the war, especially after the stalemate that these have witnessed over the past few weeks.\n\nThe Arab position has attempted to lay some foundations for dealing with the substance of the Palestinian issue, focusing at the recent Bahrain Summit meeting on two main elements: first, the holding of an international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian issue under the auspices of the UN and on the basis of the two-state solution; and second, calling for the deployment of an international peacekeeping force under the auspices of the UN in the Palestinian Territories to protect civilians until the implementation of the two-state solution.\n\nThe international movement towards resolving the Palestinian issue is growing and has included actions by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) calling on Israel to stop the war and arrest some Israeli and Hamas leaders and the recognition of the Palestinian state by some European countries.\n\nHowever, it is clear that these developments have not led to any movement in the wider security and political situation in the light of the following factors.\n\nFirst, there is Israel's insistence on continuing its military operations in Rafah until it completes its announced objectives. Second, there is Israel's continued occupation of the Palestinian Rafah Crossing, which is one of the main obstacles to achieving the objective of aid and a truce. Third, there is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ability to continue to head his extremist coalition government despite some signs of internal division. These have not yet crystallised into a real threat to the position of that government, which enjoys a majority that gives it the ability to continue unless elections are brought forward.\n\nFourth, there is the continued willingness of the US to provide protection to Israel against international pressure, reflecting the extent of the impact of the presidential election year on the US position towards Israel. Fifth, there is Hamas' continued adherence to its announced positions regarding linking its approval of a new prisoner-swap deal to reach a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nLastly, there is the Palestinian Authority's (PA) position on how to deal with rapid changes in the situation, whether in terms of control of the crossings or its role in the post-war phase.\n\nEgypt is one of the most important parties working to end the Gaza crisis, despite some attempts that seek to undermine the effectiveness of its role. Egypt's conviction that its role goes beyond merely mediating in the present crisis, but also includes its wider role of protecting the Palestinian cause and countering attempts to liquidate it, has led it to overcome some current obstacles and move towards resuming its indispensable role in delivering aid to the Gaza Strip, returning to the truce negotiations, and preparing for the next phase.\n\nWe are facing developments in the Gaza crisis that reflect the continuing complexities that stand in the way of finding a permanent solution in the near future. In my opinion, the international community must now draw up two roadmaps: one for a complete cessation of Israel's war of extermination, and the second being a long-term roadmap focusing on the post-war period so that we will not find ourselves emerging from the war only to slip into a post-war crisis.\n\nUS and international support for Egyptian moves and for those of the Arab parties that are moving with Egypt is now essential, as is necessary flexibility from the parties concerned so that we can reach a first stage of calming the present crisis. Then we can focus in the future on addressing the Palestinian cause, which is the most important issue despite the difficulties we will face as we deal with it.\n\nI am convinced that it will be possible to overcome these difficulties if we act now, but it may become impossible to do so at a later stage.\n\nThe writer is deputy director of the Egyptian Centre for Strategic Studies (ECSS).",

We need to get things in from either Jordan or Egypt. In the last few days we have distributed everything we have access to, which is why it is becoming all the more urgent to make sure those crossings are functioning,\" said Knapp.\n\nThe agency's functioning capacity in Rafah in southern Gaza is still in place in partnership with local groups and other agencies such as the World Food Program through the logistics structure they set up in the beginning of the war with warehouses and trucking capacities, Knapp noted.\n\nHowever, their ability to move things has been severely impacted by the Israeli incursion launched in early May that has caused nearly 1 million people to flee from Rafah. They now seek refuge in squalid tent camps and other war-ravaged areas.\n\nPalestinian health officials said at least 45 people, around half of them women and children, were killed in a strike on May 26 in Rafah's camp, a consequence of an Israeli strike nearby that caused fire in the densely populated camp.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the strike caused widespread outrage, including from some of Israel's closest allies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\"\n\nThe International Court of Justice May 24 called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, an order it has no power to enforce.\n\nCRS moved its operations from Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip at the start of the war, which broke out following an Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities.\n\nThe Hamas assault left 1,200 mostly civilians murdered and 254 people taken captive into Gaza, according to Israel, with 125 hostages still remaining in Gaza, including 39 bodies.\n\nThe subsequent Israeli military campaign into Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, mostly children and women, according to the Hamas Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not differentiate between Hamas members and civilians.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has said that 1.7 million people in Gaza have been displaced since the start of the war in October.\n\nFamilies that have been already displaced several times are on the move again due to military operations and Israeli evacuation orders. As of May 19, the estimated number of people displaced from Rafah is nearly 815,000 people since May 6, with a further 100,000 people displaced in northern Gaza, UNRWA said in its latest report published on May 24.\n\nFor many families this most recent displacement is the seventh or eighth time they have had to move since the start of the war, said Knapp. People are lacking not only in basic supplies such as food and shelter but also clean water, sanitation, health care and education, he said.\n\n\"It is the needs of the whole of the person and it is what has been challenging on a large scale in such a significant crisis for the past seven, eight months,\" he said.\n\nU.N. humanitarian organizations also have repeated warnings that famine is still an imminent threat because of aid restrictions and lack of safe access.\n\nKnapp said CRS has now had to shift its operations from Rafah to the middle area of the Gaza Strip and Khan Younis.\n\n\"We are not able to service Rafah. Our operational capacity is still in place but the big obstacle is the functioning of the crossings where a deep focus is needed for goods to be able to come to the north and south of Gaza,\" he said. \"That is what we are advocating for, especially that the Kerem Shalom crossing be accessible from the Gaza side as soon as possible.\"\n\nSince the start of the war CRS has been able to serve almost 800,000 people with aid including cash, food parcels, bedding supplies, tarps, tents and hygiene kits through its already established partnerships network, said Knapp, who was in Gaza almost at the beginning of May and expressed \"deep concern\" about the physical conditions and enormous human displacement he witnessed.\n\n\"It has been so challenging to get things in and to operate safely. We are not able to provide the same standards in Gaza as we are in other places,\" he said.\n\nCRS head of Gaza Office Bassam Nasser said in a Whatsapp written exchange that looting of warehouses is rampant, and even if people have money, they are unable to access their cash from banks with only three ATMs in service in the southern Gaza Strip. Goods are only sold in stalls in the streets for cash and there is a critical shortage of feminine hygiene products, baby diapers, cooking gas, fuel and bottled water, said Nasser.\n\nNasser said critical needs vary for each family. As a pharmacist, his wife has been trying to maintain a supply of medicines for the chronically ill in Rafah, to where his family fled from their home in northern Gaza in the early days of the war.\n\nNasser's family was among the tens of thousands of people who had to once again escape from Rafah.\n\n\"The threats turned into artillery bombardment and air strikes in the neighborhood (where) we lived in,\" Nasser said. He said his family was \"among the lucky families\" who found an apartment shared with three other families with 20 people living in a 1,300-square-foot apartment of a family who was able to leave Gaza in the early days of the war. Each family pays $500 rent without any services and must buy water from trucks and has electricity only if there are solar panels, he said.\n\n\"I am losing faith in global and universal values, and day after the other, (I turn) to think that the world is ruled by racists powers and elements. Personally, I never want to get to this conclusion as it will destroy what I live for,\" said Nasser.", "source": {"uri": "thedialog.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dialog"}, "authors":

We discuss the ruling and the massacre in Rafah with Ahmed Abofoul, a legal researcher and advocacy officer at the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq who was born and raised in Gaza. Abofoul is now based in The Hague, where the International Court of Justice recently ordered Israel to halt its assault on Rafah in a genocide case brought by South Africa. Abofoul notes the significance of the World Court ruling but decries Israel's complete disregard for international orders, including previous ICJ rulings this year. \"Israel is lying,\" while its allies are \"parroting whatever Israel is saying.\" Without a direct enforcement mechanism, attempts to rein in Israeli attacks are likely to continue to fail. Will \"complicit\" Western states \"continue business as usual, or will we see sanctions on Israel?\" Abofoul asks. \"Everything I know in Gaza has been destroyed,\" he adds. \"This is a genocide. This is about the erasure of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and as a whole, and this is the essence of Zionism as a settler-colonial ideology.\"\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nIsrael's bombing of the tent camp in Rafah that killed over 45 people on Sunday, housing displaced Palestinians in a so-called safe zone, came just two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately stop its assault on Rafah. This is ICJ presiding Judge Nawaf Salam.\n\nJUDGE NAWAF SALAM: The court considers that in conformity with the obligations under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Rafah governorate which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The order came in response to an emergency request by South Africa, which has brought a genocide case against Israel at the World Court. Though the order is legally binding, there is no enforcement mechanism.\n\nThis is Abed Mohammed al-Attar, a Palestinian man whose brother and other relatives were killed in Israel's latest attacks on Rafah.\n\nABDE MOHAMMED AL-ATTAR: [translated] The decision of the World Court is a lie. They are still killing. There are planes 24 hours a day. There are martyrs and killings all the time. There are wounded and injuries, children becoming orphaned, innocent people. They haven't done anything. They were displaced from one place to another, looking for a living.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined at The Hague by Ahmed Abofoul, senior legal research and advocacy officer at the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq. He was born and raised in Gaza.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! It's very important to have you with us today. You know, the ruling of the International Court of Justice came down right after Democracy Now! aired on Friday. So, I'm wondering if you can start off by summarizing the ruling and the significance of it, Ahmed.\n\nAHMED ABOFOUL: Thank you for having me again, Amy.\n\nThis is a very significant ruling. The court basically ruled that Israel must halt its military offensive on Rafah and any other acts that might endanger the Palestinian people as a group and their rights under the Genocide Convention. But the court also ruled that Israel must keep the Rafah crossing open and must allow all investigative bodies and commission of inquiries mandated by the U.N. to enter the territory and investigate alleged Genocide Convention violations and crimes and genocidal acts that may have been committed. And the court also ordered Israel to report to it after one month on its compliance with this order.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is the third provisional measures order. In the first one, the court responded to South Africa's request by accepting some of the measures that South Africa requested. In the second one, the court also responded to South Africa's request by calling on Israel to ensure that humanitarian aid will enter the Gaza Strip from land crossings, including the Rafah crossings and other crossings, sending a very important signal to world leaders, especially in the West, that there is no alternative to allowing humanitarian aid by land -- not the American pier or any other way, including airdrops.\n\nIn this provisional measure, as I indicated, we can see the evolution of the court's, let's say, analysis of the situation and the gravity and the deterioration of the situation. So, it's important also to note that for every provisional measures request, the court has to assess again whether the court can issue such an order. So, the fact that the court decided on three different occasions to issue such order, it means that the situation continue to deteriorate, and the Palestinian people as a group in the Gaza Strip are threatened, in whole or in part, by Israel's military operation, especially in Rafah.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Ahmed, I wanted to ask you, on Monday -- about the European response to the war in Gaza. On Monday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said he's requesting 26 European Union member states to issue official support to the International Court of Justice and to take steps to ensure Israel respects its decisions. Your sense of the impact of how Europe is lining up on this issue?\n\nAHMED ABOFOUL: Well, some European states, as you indicated, have been saying that this order is binding and Israel must comply with it -- better late than never. These orders have been binding from the first provisional measure order, which some states -- in my view, disgracefully -- tried to ignore or label as unhelpful. But we see also that in the West, in Europe, in particular, some states are taking different position than that has been taken in relation to the situation in Palestine, including Spain, Ireland, including also recognizing Palestine, but also Belgium, Norway and many others. So, what we're witnessing now is the emergence of a different opinion in the European continent by states who are saying that this ruling must be complied with, including Germany. I think there was a statement by German officials that this order is binding.\n\nThe question is how the European Union will ensure that Israel complies with this order. As you and your viewers may already know, international law does not have an enforcement mechanism. And such order is worth what states make of it and how they utilize it to ensure compliance. So, the question is: Will the European Union and the individual European states continue, for example, their relations with Israel and business as usual, or will we see sanctions on Israel and other repercussions? Of course, it's long overdue for Western states to impose sanctions on Israel, sever diplomatic relations, stop importing Israeli settlements' goods, stop exporting arms to the Israeli apartheid regime. Western states, in general, are complicit in these crimes, especially the U.S., to be honest. The Palestinian victims who are being shattered apart, especially in Rafah, like we saw in the targeting of tents in a designated safe area, were most probably targeted by American weapons.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I mean, this is key, what happened on Sunday. This was just two days after the ICJ ruling, talking about not having an enforcement mechanism. As you said, this was designated as a safe zone. There was so much international outcry as Israel bombed the tent camp and it all went up in flames. Israel said it was because there was an oil tank next to it. But this is the nature of these concentrated population centers. The horrifying video went viral showing a man desperately holding up the charred corpse of a headless child amidst the still-blazing flames of the attack, causing the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu calling it a \"tragic mistake,\" and he'll investigate. That's the response when there isn't an enforcement mechanism. You have Rashida Tlaib, the Palestinian American -- only Palestinian American congressmember, this weekend demanding that President Biden lay out his red line, which he has talked about but at this point has not seemed to say that Netanyahu has crossed it. Talk about the role, for example, of the U.N. Security Council and what it would mean if it took up the ICJ's ruling?\n\nAHMED ABOFOUL: No, absolutely, you're making a very important point, Amy. And if you'll allow me just to remind your viewers of the fact that after every order of provisional measures by the ICJ, Israel has, in a way, responded in a such barbaric way targeting the Palestinians.\n\nTake for example the first provisional measures, in which the court relied on UNRWA statements to assess what's going on on the ground. And right after that order, Israel accused UNRWA of being involved in the October 7th attack. And several states, including the U.S., rushed to cut funding or suspend funding from UNRWA, without even viewing any evidence of such allegations, parroting whatever Israel is saying -- in fact, lying. And then, shortly after, as we know, they restored funding, because they found out that Israel is lying.\n\nAfter the second order, which was focused on humanitarian aid and on the danger of famine that the court described as sitting in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli apartheid regime, immediately after this order, targeted seven workers of the World Central Kitchen, killing nationals of several Western states, and claimed that it was a mistake, although the targeting was of several vehicles apart from each other, and the reporting showed that such acts could not possibly be a mistake.\n\nAfter the third order, which is focused on Rafah and the fact that Israel has not provided the court with any convincing arguments or evidence that it has ensured the safe passage of civilians into those designated areas or the basic services needed for the survival of the population who would be moved to that area -- the court ordered that Israel must halt its operation -- Israel's response was to target civilians in a safe -- allegedly designated safe area, and then claimed once again it's a mistake.\n\nSo, I think at this stage, one must not be fool enough to entertain Israel's lies. Israel is lying. While we speak, Amy, just now, I received the news that Israel has targeted another gathering of tents in al-Mawasi area, west the Rafah governorate, where Israel also designated it as a safe area. The preliminary reporting indicates that over 20 persons have been torn apart by this bombing. The preliminary reporting I received is horrific, like that of the targeting on tents that you just mentioned and the horrific images that we've seen. So, I think any allegation that Israel is doing this by mistake is just ridiculous. And at this stage, entertaining such allegations is just in service of Israel's monstrous and barbaric attacks against civilians.\n\nLet me also remind you, Amy, of the targeting of Al-Ahli Hospital, when Israel claimed that it wasn't an Israeli rocket, and then, after that, we had several investigations, including from Western media outlets, showing that it is in fact an Israeli targeting. So, what Israel is doing and what Israel was doing since targeting Al-Ahli Hospital is just sensing the pulse, how the international community will react to targeting civilians in a hospital. And unfortunately, the international community has not lived up to the responsibility, has allowed such monstrous acts, and then it's continued. We saw how many hospitals have been targeted, based on these lies. And this is a deliberate act, Amy, because it's with a genocidal mentality and intent to destroy any safe spot needed for or essential to the survival of the civilian population. And hospitals would be on top of that list.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Ahmed, I wanted to ask about -- a little about your personal story. You're a Palestinian Dutch international lawyer. You've dedicated your life to defending human rights. But you were born and raised in Gaza and survived several Israeli assaults in Gaza. What is the situation with your own family there in Gaza today?\n\nAHMED ABOFOUL: You know, this is, as you mentioned, a matter that is close to my heart. It's personal in many ways. Since the beginning of this genocide, as I mentioned previously on the show, I lost quite a big number of my family, over 80 members from both sides of the family, including my oldest uncle and many others. My family, part of my family, was, in fact, in those tents, where they were targeted. We were lucky enough that only a few weeks ago I managed to get part of them out of the Gaza Strip, thanks to a funding campaign I launched, and I managed to get part of them to Egypt. But the rest of my family remains in Gaza.\n\nAnd now, after Israel invaded the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, Palestinians don't have a chance either of leaving the Gaza Strip or even receiving the much-needed humanitarian aid or medical teams that are much needed to enter the Gaza Strip. So, the situation is horrific on every Palestinian. I wouldn't say that our suffering is the only thing. Palestinians across the occupied Gaza Strip have lost many loved ones. Gaza has been destroyed. Everything I know in Gaza has been destroyed, from my kindergarten to my school to my university, Al-Azhar University, and many other places, which I have so many memories of friends, family and loved ones and have been destroyed.\n\nThis is a genocide. This is about the erasure of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and as a whole, and this is the essence of Zionism as a settler-colonial ideology that is premised on the elimination of the indigenous Palestinians, to replace them in their land, supported by Western complicity in such atrocity crimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ahmed Abofoul, I want to thank you for being with us, and also condolences on the loss of 80 members of your family. Ahmed is senior legal research and advocacy officer at the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq.\n\nAnd just to be exact in my quoting of the Michigan Democratic Congressmember Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, she posted on social media, quote, \"The whole world is taking action to stop the genocide of Palestinians, including the International Court of Justice. Where is President Biden's 'red line'?\" she asked.\n\nNext up, May is Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. We'll remember the work of photographer Corky Lee.

These attacks have resulted in the largest number of casualties since the Rafah incursion began and they come a few days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its offensive on the city. These devastating attacks occurred on Sunday night, in an area housing displaced people where tents caught fire, with a further attack today in a supposed safe zone.\n\nKiryn Lanning, IRC's Team Lead in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), said,\n\n\"We are deeply outraged by the tragic loss of civilian life as the Israeli incursion into Rafah intensifies. These incidents reaffirm our repeated warnings that no place and nobody is safe in Gaza. Camps housing displaced people must never be targeted. The reports from the ground are extremely disturbing - with people trapped in the fire and burning tents.\n\n\"There was not a single evacuation order for these attacks given to civilians that have sought shelter in Rafah after being displaced from other parts of Gaza. The targeting of so-called safe zones, densely populated with displaced civilians, is a violation of International Humanitarian Law and completely unjustifiable. The high concentration of civilians in these zones makes it impossible to avoid significant collateral damage and high mortality rates during military offensives, even with precision targeting.\n\n\"There must be accountability for these actions to ensure that such tragedies do not continue to occur. All parties involved in the conflict must be held responsible for their actions and commit to upholding the principles of IHL.\"", "source": {"uri": "rescue.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Rescue Committee (IRC)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rescue_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Rescue Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amman"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amman"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collateral damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://www.rescue.org/sites/default/files/styles/widescreen_16x9_1280px_wide/public/2024-01/pic_14.jpg?itok=tKwq0c1F", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605148", "eventUri": "eng-9605148", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amman"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

A military spokesman said Tuesday the munitions used in the Israeli strike were too small to set off a big blaze.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said the attack ignited tent fires in an area sheltering displaced people. Israel said it killed two senior Hamas militants in the attack.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council was meeting Tuesday afternoon in a closed session requested by member Algeria to discuss the attack.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Tuesday that the \"relentless violence\" must stop and reiterated his call for a humanitarian cease-fire and the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages.\n\nGaza medical personnel and residents reported new Israeli airstrikes Tuesday in the area of al-Mawasi on the enclave's coast, where thousands of people have fled to what Israel has said is a designated \"safe zone.\"\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said at least 20 civilians were killed. The Israel Defense Forces denied striking the area.\n\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Tuesday that more than 940,000 people have fled Rafah in the past three weeks amid Israel's offensive. Another 100,000 have been displaced by fighting in northern Gaza.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths issued a statement late Monday calling the Rafah attack \"utterly unacceptable.\" He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's explanation that what happened was a \"tragic mistake.\"\n\n\"Whether the attack was a war crime or a 'tragic mistake,' for the people of Gaza, there is no debate,\" Griffiths said. \"What happened last night was the latest -- and possibly most cruel -- abomination. To call it 'a mistake' is a message that means nothing for those killed, those grieving, and those trying to save lives.\"\n\nGriffiths said the U.N. \"warned that a military operation in Rafah would lead to a slaughter\" and added that there are no safe areas or humanitarian zones in Gaza.\n\n\"Despite our best effort, not to harm those not involved, unfortunately a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the case,\" Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel needs to carry out an offensive in Rafah in order to achieve its goal of ensuring Hamas cannot operate in Gaza and threaten Israel in the future.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, decried the Rafah attack, saying in a statement Monday, \"The images from the camp are horrific and point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by Israel that have already led to so many civilian deaths.\"\n\nEven as he noted the Israeli military's announced investigation, T\u00fcrk said it was \"shockingly clear\" that the decision to strike an area \"densely packed with civilians\" would result in the \"entirely predictable outcome\" of the death of more Palestinian civilians.\n\nT\u00fcrk called on Israel to abide by last week's International Court of Justice order to totally halt its offensive in Rafah. He also urged Palestinian armed groups to stop firing rockets indiscriminately into Israel \"in clear violation of international humanitarian law\" and release all the remaining 100 or so hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza.\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel also called the strikes \"horrendous\" and urged Israel to stop its offensive in Rafah.\n\n\"Horrendous to see innocent Palestinian civilians killed in the recent attack. There is no safe zone for the internally displaced in Rafah,\" Michel said on the X social media platform.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry said Monday that the attack could complicate efforts to mediate stalled cease-fire talks and the return of the hostages held in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war was triggered by the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials, and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent counteroffensive has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, a death toll that includes both civilians and combatants, according to the Gaza health ministry.", "source": {"uri":

He told CBS News and the BBC in exclusive interviews that he had enough of Spirit management telling him to conceal and downplay manufacturing issues in his reports.\n\n\"If quality mattered, I would still be at Spirit,\" Paredes told CBS News. \"It was very rare for us to look at a job and not find any defects.\"\n\nKansas-based Spirit AeroSystems used to be a part of Boeing, but was spun off into a separate company in 2005. The company manufactures plane parts that are sent to Boeing for final assembly. Notably, Spirit produces the door plug panel for the Boeing 737 Max 9s. The company, and Boeing, came under intense scrutiny in January after a door plug panel blew off a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines in mid-air.\n\nAnother whistleblower, Joshua Dean, who worked as a quality engineer at Spirit died early this month at 45 years old after a sudden illness. He too claimed to have noticed manufacturing defects on Boeing 737 planes.\n\nDean's death came two months after Boeing whistleblower John Barrett was found dead of an apparent suicide a day after testifying against the planemaker.\n\nParedes told CBS News that he developed a fear of flying after working at Spirit. The outlet says it reviewed photos of dented fuselages and a wrench left behind in a supposedly finished part, set to be delivered to Boeing.\n\n\"Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them,\" he said.\n\nParedes said he felt pressured by Spirit management to ignore manufacturing defects so the company could produce more plane parts faster. He alleges he earned the nickname \"Showstopper\" from his bosses, because defects Paredes would flag in his reports would end up delaying deliveries.\n\nIn particular, Paredes flagged that some 737 parts would come off the production line missing key fasteners, hardware that joins pieces of the plane together. He's concerned that the defects could cause safety issues with some of Boeing's planes.\n\n\"It's a recipe for disaster,\" Paredes told CBS. \"It was just a matter of time before something bad happened.\"\n\nParedes noticed the safety culture at Spirit worsened in 2018, when Spirit went from producing about 30 fuselages per month to over 50. In 2022, he said he received an email from his bosses to be less specific about where he was finding issues with plane parts in order to speed up his inspections.\n\nHe emailed his managers back, saying he found the request was \"unethical\" and put him \"in a very uncomfortable situation.\"\n\n\"I was put in a place where if I said no, I was gonna get fired,\" Paredes recounted. \"If I said yes, I was admitting that I was gonna do something wrong.\"\n\nIn retaliation, he says, Paredes was demoted from his position as a team leader. He ended up filing a formal complaint with company HR and he was found to be wrongfully demoted. Paredes was reinstated to his former position, but he said, at that point, he no longer wanted to work for Spirit.\n\n\"It takes a toll on you and I was tired of fighting,\" said Paredes. \"I was tired of trying to do the right thing.\"\n\nIn his interview with the BBC, Paredes claims that Boeing \"knew that Spirit was sending fuselages with many defects.\"\n\n\"Spirit was wrong for sending defective fuselages, but at the same time, Boeing was also wrong for accepting them,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement to CBS, a Boeing spokesperson said that the planemaker has long employed a team to inspect fuselages built by Spirit and fix defects. Outgoing CEO Dave Calhoun told CNBC that increased oversight of Spirit's operations have reduced the defect rate in fuselages by about 80 per cent.\n\nParedes traces the safety culture issues at Spirit back to Boeing. He said that many leaders in the company stayed on after Spirit split from Boeing back in 2005.\n\n\"I think the culture was bad already,\" he said. \"Over time it just became worse.\"\n\nSpirit told the BBC that it \"strongly disagree(d)\" with Paredes' allegations against the company. \"We are vigorously defending against his claims.\"\n\nSpirit spokesman Joe Buccino told CBS that the company remains \"committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards.\"\n\n\"We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected.\"\n\nBoeing maintains that the 737 Max is safe.\n\nOn Thursday, two Boeing 737 planes were involved in accidents within a matter of hours, with one plane's tire bursting during landing in Turkey, while another plane skidded off the runway in Senegal.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That caused the grounding of all 171 MAX 9 jets by the FAA and instigated an investigation.\n\nSpeaking to CBS and the BBC in an interview, Mr Paredes said he worked on the end of the production line at Spirit AeroSystems for around a decade in Kansas, doing final inspections on 737 fuselages before these were shipped off to Boeing.\n\nHe claimed that he was used to finding \"anywhere from 50 to 100, 200\" defects on fuselages that were due to be sent to Boeing.\n\n\"I was finding a lot of missing fasteners, a lot of bent parts, sometimes even missing parts,\" Mr Paredes, who left the company in 2022, said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out,\" he claimed. \"They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget ... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nThe former quality manager claimed that he felt under pressure from managers to keep his reports of defects to a minimum, and was even given the nickname \"Showstopper\" for slowing down the production and delivery process when he wrote reports of defects that needed repairs.\n\nHe claims that they \"always said they didn't have time to fix the mistakes\" and needed to get the planes out.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson told CBS that the company has long had a team that finds and fixes defects in fuselages built by Spirit AeroSystems while Boeing is assembling the planes.\n\nThe spokesperson added that since the beginning of March, Boeing engineers have been inspecting each Spirit fuselage after it comes from the production line in Kansas.\n\nMr Paredes said that, eventually, Spirit bosses asked him to speed up his inspections by being less specific over the issues he was finding. He said that when he expressed his opposition to this, he was demoted and moved to a different part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Paredes said that upon being moved, he filed an ethics complaint with human resources.

He has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. His work has previously appeared on Distractify, The Blast, and Entertainment Daily.\n\nA whistleblower is claiming that it was a regular occurrence for defective plane parts to make it off the production line of one of Boeing's largest suppliers, according to a new report.\n\nIn a joint interview with the BBC and CBS, Santiago Paredes revealed he often found up to 200 defects on individual items produced by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan., a major airline parts provider for the company.\n\nParedes, who worked with the company from 2010 to 2022, claimed he found \"anywhere from 50 to 100, 200\" defects, specifically on fuselages due to be shipped to Boeing.\n\n\"I was finding a lot of missing fasteners, a lot of bent parts, sometimes even missing parts,\" he added of the manufacturing issues.\n\nParedes was cited as \"Former Employee 1\" in a lawsuit against Spirit, brought by its shareholders.\n\nBoeing tells PEOPLE in a statement, \"We have been working closely with Spirit AeroSystems and its leadership to strengthen the quality of the commercial airplanes that we build together.\" They also confirmed \"preliminary discussions about making Spirit AeroSystems a part of Boeing again.\"\n\n\"We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders,\" the statement continued.\n\nBoeing notes that \"Although there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement, we are committed to finding ways to continue to improve the safety and quality of the airplanes on which millions of people depend each and every day.\"\n\nThe company also highlighted a recent International Air Transport Association (IATA) report that found 2023 to be the safest year for commercial aviation.\n\nPEOPLE reached out to Spirit AeroSystems directly for comment as well, but they did not immediately respond.\n\nSpirit Aerosystems told the BBC they \"strongly disagree\" with the allegations raised by Paredes, and maintained that they are \"vigorously defending against his claims.\"\n\nParedes joins a line of Boeing-tied whistleblowers revealing alleged quality control issues in parts used by the company on their aircraft in 2024. This includes John Barnett, a former quality control manager for Boeing who was found dead on March 9 in Charleston, S.C., of an apparent suicide, and Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Spirit AeroSystems who died on April 30, after experiencing a sudden illness.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating Boeing due to allegations that the company reported falsified aircraft inspections by some of their employees.\n\nThe former Spirit employee stated during his joint BBC and CBS interview that some defects were minor, but others were much more serious. He also noted how he was pressured to have less scrutiny toward quality control during his tenure with the company.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said, adding that he was given the nickname \"Showstopper\" for slowing down production in an effort to be more cautious.\n\nParedes further claimed, \"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Paredes stated that his manager ordered him to alter how defects in parts were reported in an effort to lower the overall number of issues. He claimed that when he protested the change, he was demoted and moved to another part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said. As a result, Paredes said he filed an \"ethics complaint\" against the company, addressing their human resources department and Spirit's then-chief executive, Tom Gentile. He stated that in his email, he told coworkers he had \"lost faith on the quality organization here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help.\"\n\nParedes claimed his complaint was partially upheld, resulting in him being reinstated in his former role and given back pay. However, he ultimately decided to leave the company, noting that he's hesitant to fly on any Boeing 737 Max aircraft, on the chance that it contains parts from the Wichita Spirit AeroSystems factory.\n\nHe said, \"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" adding, \"And then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying -- because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastener", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Air Transport Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/MZdLOSU9zoRn1utFafGZ1lQEzt8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(720x448:722x450)/boeing-plane-050924-tout-785596b60ed04ed0a94e1ff1db10ab23.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-09", "textStart": 2459, "textEnd": 2466}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2588, "textEnd": 2596}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Also on March 1, Boeing shared that we entered into discussions to acquire Spirit AeroSystems.\"\n\nWhile at Spirit, Mr Paredes found several flaws, some of which were minor, but others were more significant, he told the BBC.\n\nHe added that he felt pressured to be \"less rigorous\".\n\nThe whistleblower claimed: \"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages.\n\n\"They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit are part of his testimony in a legal action filed by shareholders against the company.\n\nBut he is simply referred to as \"Former Employee 1\" in legal documents.\n\nMr Paredes claimed that things reached a breaking point when his manager allegedly ordered him to alter the way defects were reported in order to lower their total quantity.\n\nHe claimed that after he objected, he was demoted and sent to a different area of the facility.\n\nThe former employee said: \"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns.\"\n\nSubsequently, Mr. Paredes wrote to Spirit's then-CEO, Tom Gentile, and lodged a \"ethics complaint\" with the company's HR department.\n\nIn that message, he wrote: \"I have lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help\".\n\nAfter his complaint was partially sustained, Mr Paredes was later given back pay and put back in his leadership position.\n\nShortly after, he departed from the company.\n\nEven now, he still says he wouldn't want to travel on a 737 Max if aircraft still had defects from the Wichita manufacturing.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying - because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\"\n\nSpirit AeroSystems and Boeing have both come under heavy scrutiny after a door fell from a brand new 737 Max shortly after takeoff in January - leaving a gaping hole in the plane's side.\n\nAccording to investigations, the door was originally installed by Spirit but was later removed by Boeing personnel to correct improper riveting.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, a US regulator, began an audit of both companies' production procedures as a result of the incident.\n\nThe FAA then discovered numerous instances in which the businesses disregarded manufacturing control procedures.\n\nMr Paredes' bombshell claims come shortly after a Boeing 737 plane with 78 onboard skidded off the runway as its wing burst into flames in Senegal.\n\nThe incident happened early this morning after the plane's left wing and engine reportedly caught fire during landing at the Dakar airport.\n\nThe problem on the Transair flight happened after the plane took off from Bamako Airport.\n\nThe aircraft reportedly experienced a hydraulic issue before the problematic landing at Blaise Diagne Airport.\n\nThere is no suggestion that Boeing is to blame and the exact cause of this latest incident is not yet known.\n\nA day earlier, a Boeing cargo plane crash-landed on its nose after its front landing gear failed in another major incident.\n\nEarlier this month, a Boeing 747 was caught on camera bouncing along the runway.\n\nThe Lufthansa Airlines plane was seen dramatically smashing into the ground twice in Los Angeles Airport (LAX) before the pilot gave up and aborted the rough landing.\n\nTwo days earlier, a wheel fell off a Boeing 737 fully loaded with passengers as smoke billows from the commercial jet.\n\nDramatic footage showed the plane grinding along the runway before it was forced to make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff.\n\nThe multiple mishaps come as the aircraft is giant is facing controversy over safety concerns.", "source": {"uri":

They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget [...]If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.'\n\nWhen Mr Paredes protested, he was demoted and moved to another part of the factory, he said.\n\nHe told the BBC: 'I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns.'\n\nAfter raising an ethics complaint with Spirit's HR, he wrote an email to the company's then chief executive Tom Gentile, writing that he had 'lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help.'\n\nWhile he was eventually reinstated in his leadership role and given back-pay, he had been pushed to his limit.\n\nHe soon left Spirit after working there from 2010 until 2022 for another Boeing supplier.\n\nBut the defects he allegedly spotted have now left him 'very uncomfortable' to fly on Boeing 737 Max planes in case they still carry parts with defects.\n\nHe said he almost became afraid of flying after working at Spirit.\n\nHe told CBS News he often found problems when inspecting the area of the same door panel that fell off a Boeing 737 plane during an Alaskan Airline flight in January.\n\nHe claimed it happened because Spirit 'let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors.'\n\nFollowing the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed quality checks and paused the production expansion of the 737 Max.\n\nThe faulty door had been originally fitted by Spirit, but it had been subsequently removed by Boeing technicians to fix a faulty riveting, the BBC reports citing the investigation.\n\nThe FAA found multiple instances where both Spirit and Boeing failed to comply with manufacturing control practices, according to an audit.\n\nMr Parades was included in a shareholder lawsuit against Spirit, citing him as 'Former Employee 1' who alleged 'widespread quality failures' at the company.\n\nHe claimed Boeing was aware of the failures.\n\nSpirit's spokesperson Joe Buccino told Metro in a statement: 'We take all employee concerns about quality, safety, work practices, and products very seriously.\n\n'Our employees' well-being and the quality of our work are both top priorities for us. To this end, we have recently enhanced our reporting system with the Quality 360 program, which includes QR codes and a streamlined format to make it easier for employees to submit anonymous complaints.\n\n'We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected.\n\n'While we firmly believe the plaintiffs' claims in the amended complaint are unfounded, we cannot comment on specific allegations due to the ongoing litigation.\n\n'We remain committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards.'\n\nSpirit asked a judge to dismiss the shareholder lawsuit on the basis of Mr Paredes being reinstated after he was demoted, citing this as proof that the company values quality control, CBS reports.\n\nBoeing told Metro.co.uk it has entered into discussions to buy Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nThe companies split into two firms almost 20 years ago.\n\nThe whistleblower claims come after previous concerns.\n\nA former Boeing employee John Barnett, 62, was found dead during a court case against the manufacturer.\n\nSouth Carolina state coroner said he died from a 'self-inflicted wound.'\n\nMr Barnett had claimed in a 2019 BBC interview that overworked staff had been deliberately fitting planes with sub-standard parts.\n\nHe also alleged he discovered serious problems with oxygen systems, suggesting that one-in-four masks might not work in an emergency.\n\nBoeing said previously it is cooperating 'fully and transparently' with the ongoing investigation.\n\nAnother Boeing whistleblower Joshua Dean, 45, died suddenly after claiming he was fired for flagging concerns about safety standards at the Spirit AeroSystems Wichita plant.\n\nHis death appears to be due to natural causes after suffering from an infection.\n\nHe worked as a quality auditor at the same plant were Mr Paredo was until he left in mid-2022.\n\nMr Paredo told CBS News why he decided to speak publicly: 'In a way I think before, if something happens to me, I'd rather them hear it from me than not hear it at all.\n\n'My cry out is not a cry out to get somebody in trouble. My cry out is to highlight the defects that they well known are in their factory, but they need to fix them. So their business can be successful.'\n\nMORE : 30 things Americans consider normal but no one else really understands", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"},

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA former quality manager for Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing's largest supplier, and which builds much of the 737 Max aircraft, has claimed that he was pressured to play down any defects he found when inspecting fuselages on the plane.\n\nSantiago Paredes has gone on record as Boeing's latest whistleblower, speaking days after another whistleblower and employee of Spirit AeroSystems unexpectedly died from a fast-moving infection.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems and Boeing have both come under scrutiny after an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9's door plug blew off in mid-air in January. That caused the grounding of all 171 MAX 9 jets by the FAA and instigated an investigation.\n\nSpeaking to CBS and the BBC in an interview, Mr Paredes said he worked on the end of the production line at Spirit AeroSystems for around a decade in Kansas, doing final inspections on 737 fuselages before these were shipped off to Boeing.\n\nHe claimed that he was used to finding \"anywhere from 50 to 100, 200\" defects on fuselages that were due to be sent to Boeing.\n\n\"I was finding a lot of missing fasteners, a lot of bent parts, sometimes even missing parts,\" Mr Paredes, who left the company in 2022, said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out,\" he claimed. \"They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget ... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nThe former quality manager claimed that he felt under pressure from managers to keep his reports of defects to a minimum, and was even given the nickname \"Showstopper\" for slowing down the production and delivery process when he wrote reports of defects that needed repairs.\n\nHe claims that they \"always said they didn't have time to fix the mistakes\" and needed to get the planes out.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson told CBS that the company has long had a team that finds and fixes defects in fuselages built by Spirit AeroSystems while Boeing is assembling the planes.\n\nThe spokesperson added that since the beginning of March, Boeing engineers have been inspecting each Spirit fuselage after it comes from the production line in Kansas.\n\nMr Paredes said that, eventually, Spirit bosses asked him to speed up his inspections by being less specific over the issues he was finding. He said that when he expressed his opposition to this, he was demoted and moved to a different part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Paredes said that upon being moved, he filed an ethics complaint with human resources. He said he also wrote to Spirit AeroSystem's then chief executive to say that he had \"lost faith\" and that this was his \"last cry for help\".\n\nHe was able to regain his original leadership position but said that he left the company soon afterwards.\n\nThe former employee even went as far as saying that after working at Spirit, he \"almost grew a fear of flying\".\n\nSpirit told the BBC that it \"strongly disagree[d]\" with the allegations and is \"vigorously defending against his claims\".\n\nA spokesperson for the company also told CBS that they \"encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected\".\n\n\"We remain committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards,\" they added.\n\nMany of Mr Paredes' allegations are included in a testimony in a shareholder lawsuit against the company. He is referred to in the documents as \"Former Employee 1\".\n\nMr Paredes is speaking up shortly after Joshua Dean, who worked as a quality auditor at Spirit AeroSystems, died in hospital following the onset of a fast-progressing infection.\n\nAnother whistleblower, John Barnett, a quality control engineer at Boeing for 32 years, was found dead at a hotel in March, reportedly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nDean and Barnett, along with two other people, came forward alleging that corner-cutting in the manufacturing process of the MAX 9 was causing safety risks.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Spirit AeroSystems and Boeing for comment.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting.\n\nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\n\nMr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious.\n\nHe also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out.

This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\n\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, and exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed. Spirit said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the assertions in the legal action.\n\nBoeing support\n\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the planemaker's primary supplier. It builds the fuselage for every 737 Max at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, before shipping them to Boeing's own facility in Renton, near Seattle, Washington. It also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIt is now in a difficult position. It is haemorrhaging cash, and lost $617m (\u00a3494m) in the first three months of the year.\n\nBoeing has agreed to provide financial support, and is in talks to buy back its former subsidiary.\n\nSources within the aerospace giant insist that efforts are under way to address quality concerns at Spirit, and these have succeeded in reducing the number of faults in parts leaving the Wichita factory by around 80%.\n\nMr Paredes said both companies were aware of the scale of the problem with defects, and that it was discussed at weekly meetings between quality inspectors from both firms.\n\n'Cry for help'\n\nMatters came to a head for Mr Paredes personally, he claimed, when he was ordered by his manager to change the way in which defects were reported, in order to reduce their overall number.\n\nAfter he protested, he said, he was demoted and removed to another part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Paredes subsequently filed an \"ethics complaint\" with the company's human resources department, and wrote to Spirit's then chief executive, Tom Gentile.\n\nIn that email, he said \"I have lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help\".\n\nMr Paredes was subsequently reinstated in his leadership role and given back-pay after his complaint was partially upheld. He left the company soon afterwards.\n\nHe now maintains he would be reluctant to fly on a 737 Max, in case it still carried flaws that originated in the Wichita factory.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.\n\nAnd then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying - because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\"", "source": {"uri": "albaniandailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Albanian Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastener", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resource management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://albaniandailynews.com/foto/2024/05/20240509124526_art.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has said that limit will remain in place until persistent quality issues improve.\n\nAn FAA audit of Spirit's facilities for quality control found 28 things to be addressed, Shanahan said.\n\n\"I am very confident that every item has been addressed with a mitigating action and then our focus has really been the follow up. It's one thing to have the action plan, the other is to make sure we are following through,\" he said. \"[This audit was] focused on things like tagging the storage parts and scrap materials . . . Our quality plan was to address more than what they had audited and those quality plans continue to progress and grow, week by week.\"\n\nBoeing and Spirit are now conducting joint product inspections prior to shipping fuselages to the Renton, Washington, facility, which has slowed the delivery rate. Spirit now says it expects to maintain a reduced rate of approximately 31 shipsets per month -- several below regulators' cap -- for the rest of 2024.\n\nShanahan, in a news release, characterized the joint product verification with Boeing as \"a significant accomplishment that we believe will enhance quality, eliminate rework, and benefit the entire production system between our companies.\"\n\nBut Spirit acknowledges that \"undelivered units have been built-up in Wichita, Kansas, resulting in higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower operational cash flows.\"\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to front $425 million in advance payments to Spirit to offset the supplier's sputtering cash flow. As part of the deal, Spirit is providing Boeing with specified financial information on a weekly basis as buyback talks continue.\n\n\"Management has developed plans to pursue various options to improve liquidity as needed and expects these plans will sufficiently improve the Company's liquidity needs,\" the release states without providing specifics.\n\nSpirit's overall revenues increased by 19% year-over-year to just over $1.7 billion, in part due to a 33% rise in Defense and Space revenue, which climbed from $188.4 million in Q1 2023 to $250.8 million this year.\n\nBut Spirit also experienced $495.4 million in net forward losses for Q1, compared to $110 million over the same period last year. Those setbacks were primarily driven by the Airbus A350 and A220 programs, which netted losses of $280.8 million and $167.0 million, respectively, after Spirit failed to lock in a deal to renegotiate prices with Airbus.\n\nSpirit disclosed that Boeing has also indicated a production increase to the 787 Dreamliner program will be slower than expected, resulting in an anticipated forward loss of approximately $50 to $60 million in the second quarter.\n\nThe company continues to withhold its 2024 financial outlook amid an uncertain future.\n\n\"Spirit will not be providing guidance until there is further clarity on the acquisition discussions with Boeing, 737 MAX delivery and production timing, as well as ongoing commercial negotiations with Airbus,\" the release states.\n\nSpirit remains locked in several major legal battles, including a class action federal lawsuit in which company shareholders allege Spirit concealed serious defects to maximize production, disregarding safety concerns raised by former employees. One whistleblower named in that suit, a former Wichita quality auditor named Joshua Dean, died abruptly last week at age 45.\n\nSpirit has also filed a lawsuit against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in an effort to conceal documents detailing manufacturing issues that Paxton instructed the company to turn over as part of a probe he opened in March. Spirit has said Paxton's request \"violates\" its \"Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\n\nVisit The Wichita Eagle (Wichita, Kan.) at

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting.\n\nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\n\nMr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious.\n\nHe also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\n\nMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm.\n\nHowever, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\n\nBefore his departure from the firm, Mr Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.\n\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, and exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed.

As part of the deal, Spirit is providing Boeing with specified financial information on a weekly basis as buyback talks continue.\n\nSpirit's overall revenues increased by 19% year-over-year to just over $1.7 billion, in part due to a 33% rise in Defense and Space revenue, which climbed from $188.4 million in Q1 2023 to $250.8 million this year.\n\nBut Spirit also experienced $495.4 million in net forward losses for Q1, compared to $110 million over the same period last year. Those setbacks were primarily driven by the Airbus A350 and A220 programs, which netted losses of $280.8 million and $167.0 million, respectively, after Spirit failed to lock in a deal to renegotiate prices with Airbus.\n\nSpirit disclosed that Boeing has also indicated a production increase to the 787 program will be slower than expected, resulting in an anticipated forward loss of approximately $50 to $60 million in the second quarter.\n\nThe company continues to withhold its 2024 financial outlook amid an uncertain future.\n\n\"Spirit will not be providing guidance until there is further clarity on the acquisition discussions with Boeing, 737 MAX delivery and production timing, as well as ongoing commercial negotiations with Airbus.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_kelly@kansas.com", "name": "Matthew Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A220"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Marketplaces", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fundraising", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fundraising", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Spirituality", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.kansas.com/wps/build/images/kansas/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1241}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Spirit has slowed its own production by about a quarter to a 31-unit monthly pace, it said as it reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.\n\nThe disruptions will have a \"material impact\" on Spirit's cash flow throughout 2024, the supplier said in a statement. The Wichita, Kansas-based manufacturer also said it has been unable to reach a deal with Airbus SE to raise prices on parts it supplies for the A220 and advanced A350 aircraft models, which resulted in a further drag on cash flow.\n\nSpirit posted a first-quarter adjusted loss of $3.93 per share compared to a 54 cent deficit estimated by analysts. Free cash flow was negative $444 million in the quarter, far more than than the $69 million use of cash in the prior-year period. The results underscore how Boeing's crisis is pressuring the finances of the critical supplier and former unit the planemaker spun off in 2005.\n\n\"The death throes of Spirit are hard to watch, as these 1Q numbers are pretty horrendous,\" analyst Rob Stallard of Vertical Research Partners said in a note to clients on May 7.\n\nSpirit shares fell 2.4% as of 12:58 p.m. in New York, while Boeing declined about 1.2%.\n\nBoeing in March confirmed it was in discussions to acquire Spirit in an effort to bring more of its aircraft production under its direct control. The planemaker is working to stabilize its supply chain and bolster quality standards after a fuselage panel blew off a 737 Max 9 mid-flight in January.\n\nDave Calhoun, Boeing's Chief Executive Officer, has said a deal for Spirit could be reached by the end of the current quarter. However, efforts to sell Spirit's Airbus-related businesses to the European planemaker have been caught up in protracted negotiations, Bloomberg News reported on April 30.\n\n\"Ultimately, we don't expect Spirit to be a public company for that much longer,\" Stallard said. \"These results could play a part in this process, as they highlight just how desperate Spirit's financial position has become.\"\n\nBoeing agreed to inject $425 million into Spirit to help keep its close trade partner afloat in April. As of March 1, Boeing stopped accepting fuselages that need parts or repairs from its supplier. Once Spirit begins to ship higher numbers of \"clean\" airframes to Boeing, the planemaker has said it expects to see significant improvement in the flow of the narrowbody jets through its factory.\n\nSpirit is working with Boeing to step up inspections and make changes on its factory floor as flaws are discovered, CEO Pat Shanahan said during its earnings call. The supplier is seeing quality improvements on an almost weekly basis, and Shanahan said he expects the effort will yield a \"step change\" in improvements during the second half of the year.\n\n\"We're doing the right things from a business standpoint and it will pay off in the future,\" said Mark Suchinski, Spirit's chief financial officer.\n\nSpirit also said it expects incremental losses due to a slower-than-expected increase in production of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner widebody jet. That model is under fresh scrutiny from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration after the planemaker disclosed that workers at its factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, may have falsified records related to tests performed as part of work attaching wings to the aircraft's body.\n\nSpirit ended the first quarter with $352 million in cash, according to its release. The supplier said its management has developed plans to improve liquidity, without elaborating.\n\nThe company also said it will not provide financial guidance for 2024 until it had clarity on the acquisition by Boeing and its negotiations with Airbus.", "source": {"uri": "supplychainbrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "supplychainbrain.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airframe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2024/05/08/boeing-spirit-bloomberg-411221894.jpg?height=418&t=1715227511&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1476, "textEnd": 1481}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2162, "textEnd": 2170}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 2508, "textEnd": 2515}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting.\n\nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\n\nMr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious.\n\nHe also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm.\n\nHowever, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\n\nBefore his departure from the firm, Mr Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.\n\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, and exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed. Spirit said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the assertions in the legal action.\n\nBoeing support\n\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the planemaker's primary supplier. It builds the fuselage for every 737 Max at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, before shipping them to Boeing's own facility in Renton, near Seattle, Washington. It also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIt is now in a difficult position. It is haemorrhaging cash, and lost $617m (\u00a3494m) in the first three months of the year.\n\nBoeing has agreed to provide financial support, and is in talks to buy back its former subsidiary.\n\nSources within the aerospace giant insist that efforts are under way to address quality concerns at Spirit, and these have succeeded in reducing the number of faults in parts leaving the Wichita factory by around 80%.\n\nBoeing in new inquiry over 787 inspection doubts\n\nDead whistleblower accused Boeing of safety breaches\n\nHow much trouble is Boeing in?\n\nMr Paredes said both companies were aware of the scale of the problem with defects, and that it was discussed at weekly meetings between quality inspectors from both firms.\n\n'Cry for help'\n\nMatters came to a head for Mr Paredes personally, he claimed, when he was ordered by his manager to change the way in which defects were reported, in order to reduce their overall number.\n\nAfter he protested, he said, he was demoted and removed to another part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Paredes subsequently filed an \"ethics complaint\" with the company's human resources department, and wrote to Spirit's then chief executive, Tom Gentile.\n\nIn that email, he said \"I have lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help\".\n\nMr Paredes was subsequently reinstated in his leadership role and given back-pay after his complaint was partially upheld. He left the company soon afterwards.\n\nHe now maintains he would be reluctant to fly on a 737 Max, in case it still carried flaws that originated in the Wichita factory.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.\n\nAnd then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying - because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

In April 2023, he was fired from Spirit AeroSystems and later claimed that \"if you are too loud, [Boeing] will silence you.\"\n\nSantiago Paredes, also nicknamed as \"showstopper\", worked for Spirit AeroSystems in Kansas. In an interview with CBS News, he alleged that plane bodies manufactured by its largest supplier usually left the factory with serious defects.\n\n\"If quality mattered, I would still be at Spirit. It was very rare for us to look at a job and not find any defects,\" he asserted.\n\nHe even discovered an issue with an aircraft door panel that mirrored one that flew off on an Alaska Airlines trip in January.\n\n\"Why did that happen?\" Paredes remarked, adding that Spirit ignored a fault due to the strain that the employers put on the inspectors.\n\nHe claimed that he was named as the 'Showstopper' because he kept pointing out flaws that caused delays in delivery, and he was continuously asked to keep his reports to a minimum. \"They always said they didn't have time to fix the mistakes. And they needed to get the planes out.\"\n\nParedes further claimed that the firm's culture was not good.\n\nAlso Read: Boeing faces new FAA probe over 787 Dreamliner's skipped test\n\nBack in 2022, Paredes stated his employers pushed him to speed up his inspections by being less explicit about the flaws he was discovering with the fuselage.

However, they had to reinstate him after he approached the HR. Unfortunately, he has to resign in the summer of 2022 due to subsequent pressure.\n\nParedes claimed Boeing was aware about the fact that Spirit, which is not linked with Spirit Airlines, was providing defective fuselages.\n\nParedes grew fear of flying while working at Spirit. \"Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them.\"\n\nIdentified as \"Former Employee 1\" in a shareholder lawsuit against Spirit, Paredes claimed the firm had \"widespread quality failures\" that their client, Boeing, was aware of.\n\nMeanwhile, Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino stated that, while they are dedicated to resolving employees' issues, Paredes' claims were \"unfounded.\"\n\n\"We remain committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards.\"\n\nSpeaking to CBS News, a Boeing representative said that the company has a team that to find and fix flaws in fuselages made by Spirit AeroSystems.

Boeing is in talks to potentially acquire Spirit, while negotiations with Airbus continue amid significant net losses. The company faces challenges with its Airbus programs, including the potential sale of its Belfast plant and negotiations for financial compensation. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nSpirit Aerosystems has reported a massive increase in its first-quarter cash burn compared to Q1 2023.\n\nA tough first quarter\n\nSpirit AeroSystems is a Tier 1 Provider for Boeing, manufacturing the forward fuselage of every Boeing aircraft and the entire fuselage of the 737 MAX family. The company was part of Boeing until 2005 when the manufacturer sold Spirit for $900 million. Over the years, there have been talks of Boeing repurchasing Spirit, and during the first quarter, those talks gained traction, and an acquisition is likely.\n\nRelated Boeing Considers Purchasing Supplier Spirit Aerosystems\n\nDuring the first quarter, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 had a door plug blow out midflight, leading to rapid depressurization and a diversion. There were no fatalities on the flight, but the backlash has been immense. Because of the blowout and several problems found in the manufacturing process, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had to cap the 737 MAX monthly production rate, which greatly affected Spirit.\n\nPhoto: Ian Dewar Photography | Shutterstock\n\nIn the first quarter, Spirit had a cash burn of $444 million, up from $69 million last year. Its operating loss this year was greater than in 2023, primarily driven by the higher unfavorable changes in estimates during the current period. Spirit added Boeing's schedule changes in March, which significantly impacted Q1.\n\nPat Shanahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spirit, said,\n\n\"The first quarter was characterized by several events, one of great significance was the partnership with Boeing to make improvements to the safety and quality of our production systems. We collaborated with Boeing to align 737 fuselage product inspection as close as possible to where the work is performed at our factories in Wichita.\"\n\nImpacts on the Airbus side of the business\n\nOverall, the company had a net forward loss of $495.4 million. A net forward loss is an accounting technique that applies the current year's net operating loss to future years' net income to reduce tax liability. Spirit said the net losses were mainly from its work with Airbus on the A350 and A220 programs. Because of the acquisition negotiations with Boeing, the Airbus work that Spirit does needs to be sold off, and though there have been negotiations with the European manufacturer, a deal has not yet been reached.\n\nPhoto: BeAvPhoto l Shutterstock\n\nNet forward losses were primarily driven by the Airbus A350 and A220 programs of $280.8 million and $167.0 million, respectively, due to the inability to reach a conclusion to pricing negotiations with Airbus, additional firm orders, and production cost growth.\n\nSpirit also had losses from the Boeing 787 program, but those were minimal compared to the Airbus losses, just $34.1 million.\n\nIn early March, Simple Flying reported that Spirit was negotiating to sell its Belfast plant, which manufactures wings for the Airbus A220s. At the time, Airbus refused to comment on any rumors, but it has since been confirmed that there are negotiations. Late last week, reports surfaced that Airbus wants financial compensation from Spirit because of the losses. Industry sources have said that a UK Airbus plant that Spirit operates would need an investment of more than $1 billion to recover from losses.\n\nRelated Boeing And Airbus Reach Potential Agreement To Split Spirit AeroSystems", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition between Airbus and Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncontrolled decompression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/spirit-aerosystems-factory-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He's one of several former employees who have alleged safety issues with both Spirit and Boeing.\n\n\"I was finding a lot of missing fasteners, a lot of bent parts, sometimes even missing parts,\" he said. \"I said it was just a matter of time before something bad happened.\"\n\nHe said some of the issues he found were near door panels similar to the one that blew off on a Boeing 737 Max in January. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the door panel likely was missing bolts that had been removed and not put back on during repairs at Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington.\n\nA spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems, which is not related to Spirit Airlines, called the allegations presented by Paredes unfounded but said they cannot comment on them specifically due to ongoing litigation.\n\n\"We take all employee concerns about quality, safety, work practices, and products very seriously. Our employees' well-being and the quality of our work are both top priorities for us,\" Joe Buccino said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. \"We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected.\"\n\nParedes' interview with both outlets was the first he has given publicly on his experience, though he also testified about it as part of a lawsuit filed by shareholders against Spirit in December, according to both outlets.\n\nIn that suit, while only referred to as \"Former Employee 1,\" he accused the company of prioritizing production speed over quality and greenlighting known defects. If quality personnel refused to approve the defective work, production managers would complain to the employee's manager, who would allegedly find another quality personnel to approve it.\n\n\"They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget,\" Paredes said in his BBC interview. \"If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nA second former quality auditor with Spirit AeroSystems similarly testified about safety issues and concerns as part of that lawsuit. That man, Joshua Dean, claimed that he was wrongfully fired last year after flagging a significant defect with some 737 Max fuselages.\n\nDean died last week after developing a sudden illness. His death followed the March death of former Boeing quality control engineer-turned-whistleblower John Barnett, who authorities said died by suicide. Barnett was working on providing a deposition as part of a lawsuit against Boeing when he was found dead in his car, his attorneys said.\n\nRelated...", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The Wichita, Kansas-based manufacturer also said it has been unable to reach a deal with Airbus SE to raise prices on parts it supplies for the A220 and advanced A350 aircraft models, which resulted in a further drag on cash flow.\n\nSpirit posted a first-quarter adjusted loss of $3.93 per share compared to a 54 cent deficit estimated by analysts. Free cash flow was negative $444 million in the quarter, far more than than the $69 million use of cash in the prior-year period. The results underscore how Boeing's crisis is squeezing the finances of the critical supplier and former unit the planemaker spun off in 2005.\n\nSpirit shares fell 2.9% as of 9:52 a.m. in New York.\n\n\"We will be looking for color on how deliveries and production will ultimately marry up,\" Seth Seifman, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. \"The length of time that Spirit can support a cost base in excess of production will be a key question for the whole program going forward.\"\n\nBoeing in March said it was in discussions to acquire Spirit in an effort to bring more of its aircraft production under its direct control. The planemaker is working to stabilize its supply chain and bolster quality standards under close scrutiny from US regulators after a fuselage panel blew off a 737 Max 9 mid-flight in January.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun has said a deal for Spirit could be reached by the end of the current quarter. However, efforts to sell Spirit's Airbus-related businesses to the European planemaker have been caught up in protracted negotiations, Bloomberg News reported on April 30.\n\nThe planemaker last month agreed to inject $425 million into Spirit to help keep its close trade partner afloat. As of March 1, Boeing stopped accepting fuselages that need parts or repairs from its supplier. Once Spirit begins to ship higher numbers of \"clean\" airframes to Boeing, the planemaker has said it expects to see significant improvement in the flow of the narrowbody jets through its factory.\n\nSpirit on Tuesday also said it expects incremental losses due to a slower-than-expected increase in production of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner widebody jet. That model is under fresh scrutiny from the US Federal Aviation Administration after the planemaker disclosed that workers at its factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, may have falsified records related to tests performed as part of work attaching wings to the aircraft's body.\n\nSpirit ended the first quarter with $352 million in cash, according to its release. The supplier said its management has developed plans to improve liquidity, without elaborating.\n\nThe company also said it will not provide financial guidance for 2024 until it had clarity on the acquisition by Boeing and its negotiations with Airbus.", "source": {"uri": "syndication.washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spokesman.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airframe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fundraising", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fundraising", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/vU7gRAPMpSXkXBDH-Deb3y19_A0=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/07/663a73a6c8eaf.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2019, "textEnd": 2027}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 2149, "textEnd": 2156}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget ... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\n\nParedes said he regularly felt under pressure to be less rigorous during inspections, and was nicknamed \"showstopper\" for slowing down the production process by trying to tackle his concerns.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said. Eventually a manager ordered him to change the way defects were reported in order to cut the number of concerns being logged.\n\nWhen he protested against the change, he said, he was demoted and moved to a different part of Spirit's factory operations. \"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nIt is the first time that Paredes, a former air force technician, has spoken publicly about his concerns.\n\nIn January Spirit and Boeing came under intense pressure after a mid-air door panel blowout on a Boeing 737 Max 9 that left a hole in the side of the plane. Investigators said the door had initially been fitted by Spirit and later removed by Boeing staff to deal with faulty parts.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, two 737 Max planes were involved in fatal crashes, which killed a total of 346 people.\n\nA Spirit AeroSystems spokesperson told the BBC the firm \"strongly disagree[d]\" with Paredes's allegations. \"We are vigorously defending against his claims.\"\n\nBoeing declined to comment.\n\nAfter his role was allegedly changed, Paredes filed an ethics complaint with the human resources department and wrote to Spirit's chief executive saying he had \"lost faith\" and stressing it was his \"last cry for help\".\n\nParedes's complaint was partially upheld, leading him to regain his leadership position and secure back pay. However, he left Spirit soon afterwards.\n\nHis allegations have been included as testimony in a legal case filed by disgruntled Spirit shareholders who are accusing the company of trying to cover up serious and widespread quality failings.

The company said on Tuesday its \"ability to align factory costs, which include both internal and supply chain-related spending, and to react to sudden changes in production rates will have a material impact on results of operations and cash flows throughout 2024\".\n\nSpirit also said executives had \"developed plans to pursue various options to improve liquidity as needed and expects these plans will sufficiently improve the company's liquidity needs,\" without giving further details.

The whistleblower also alleged that the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout happened because of quality lapses at the company. Boeing divested Spirit AeroSystems in 2005 and is now looking to buy back the company. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nA former quality manager who worked at Spirit AeroSystems, a Tier 1 supplier for Boeing, including the fuselages for the 737, has alleged that the culture at the company has allowed many defects to slip through the cracks, including the one that resulted in the Alaska Airlines mid-flight door plug blowout in January 2024.\n\nGrowing fear of flying\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CBS News, the now-former quality manager at Spirit AeroSystems said that if quality mattered, he would still be working at the company. He left the Wichita, Kansas, US-based aerospace supplier in mid-2022. The former employee told the outlet that it was rare for quality managers not to find any defects while inspecting Boeing 737 fuselages. Simple Flying has approached Spirit AeroSystems for a comment.\n\nPhoto: Thiago B Trevisan | Shutterstock\n\nHe also told the publication that the Alaska Airlines incident happened because the company let go of the defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they had put on the quality inspectors, adding that if the culture was proper at Spirit AeroSystems, the incident would not have happened.\n\n\"Working at Spirit, I almost grew a fear of flying. Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them.\"\n\nThe Alaska Airlines mid-air door plug blowout happened in January when a Boeing 737 MAX 9, flying out of Portland International Airport (PDX), lost the plug while it was climbing out of the airport. The aircraft returned safely to its origin airport, with some passengers and one cabin crew member sustaining minor injuries, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) report.\n\nRelated Breaking: NTSB Says Bolts Were Missing From Door Plug On Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 As part of its investigation, the agency visited Spirit AeroSystem's headquarters in Wichita, Kansas. Improving quality\n\nSpirit AeroSystems, which released its Q1 2024 financial results on May 7, emphasized that it has made strides to make improvements to the safety and quality at its facilities while collaborating with Boeing. The company earned $1.7 billion of revenue, a 19% year-on-year (YoY) improvement, yet its losses ballooned to $617 million, compared to $281 million in Q1 2023.\n\nPhoto: VDB Photos | Shutterstock\n\nAccording to Pat Shanahan, the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Spirit AeroSystems, while the quarter was characterized by several events, one of the most important ones was the partnership with Boeing to improve the safety and quality of its products.\n\n\"We collaborated with Boeing to align 737 fuselage product inspection as close as possible to where the work is performed at our factories in Wichita. This is a significant accomplishment that we believe will enhance quality, eliminate rework, and benefit the entire production system between our companies.\"\n\nThe company also provided an update on the Boeing 737, with the supplier working with the aircraft manufacturer to ensure conformity before the 737's fuselages are transported to Renton, Washington, for final assembly. As a result, there have been delivery delays from Spirit AeroSystems to Boeing, with units building up at its site in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nRelated Boeing 737 MAX Fuselage Supplier Spirit AeroSystems Suffers Greater Q1 Financial Loss Than Analysts Predicted Negotiations with Boeing and Airbus drove financial losses in the first quarter. Dealing with clean fuselages out of Wichita\n\nMeanwhile, David Calhoun, the president and CEO of Boeing, told analysts during the aircraft manufacturer's Q1 2024 earnings call that already, the company has seen an improvement in the number of clean fuselages coming out of Spirit AeroSystems' facilities in Wichita, Kansas. While it started slowly, Boeing has been working on the fuselages that were trapped in the pipeline and did not go through that inspection process, resulting in a \"slow and lumpy\" production output at Boeing.\n\n\"So far, we're quite encouraged at just how clean they are and how quickly they move through our production cycle. Substantially better, faster than before. So, as we exit 2Q, we will know exactly what numbers are coming out of Wichita and what expectations are.\"\n\nPhoto: Ian Dewar Photography | Shutterstock\n\nStill, Calhoun emphasized that the companies will not rush the process, and Boeing will demand that they are clean, with the executive adding that he has liked the signals so far. In addition, Calhoun stated that a clean fuselage breezes through the factory, which is essential for the manufacturer.\n\nIn Q1, Boeing's revenues decreased by 8% YoY, with the company posting revenues of $16.5 billion. However, it managed to reduce its losses to $355 million, yet its free cash flow (FCF) during the quarter was -$3.9 billion, compared to -$786 million in Q1 2023.\n\nRelated Boeing Still Lost Less Than Q1 Last Year Despite 737 MAX Issues And Airline Compensation While it has reduced its losses, the operating cash flow and lower revenues are a cause for concern for Boeing. Bringing back Spirit\n\nDuring the same earnings call, Brian West, the chief financial officer (CFO) and Executive Vice President of Boeing, said that discussions with Spirit AeroSystems are ongoing about the former's acquisition of the latter. West explained that with any complex deal, there are a number of issues the two companies need to work on, including price, financing, and other items, such as the work Spirit AeroSystems does for \"other customers.\"\n\nIn addition to supplying parts for Boeing's aircraft programs, the supplier works with Airbus for the A220, A320, A350, and A380 aircraft while also providing various fuselage and other items for Bombardier's private jet programs, including the Global 7500.\n\n\"We believe in the strategic logic of a deal, but we'll take the time needed to get this right before we decide to enter into agreement.\"\n\nBoeing divested Spirit AeroSystems in 2005 when it announced a deal to sell its commercial aircraft operations in Kansas and Oklahoma to Onex Corporation in February of that year. At the time, the aircraft manufacturer said that it would receive around $900 million in cash and the transfer of certain liabilities and long-term supply agreements that would provide ongoing cost savings for Boeing.\n\nPhoto: JHVEPhoto | Shutterstock\n\nAlan Mulally, the then-president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA), stated that the deal supported Boeing's strategy to focus on large-scale systems integration where the company was the most competitive and was able to add the most value to its aircraft and services.\n\nHowever, in the past few years, including multiple instances in 2023, Spirit AeroSystems and, in turn, Boeing had to deal with quality issues at the supplier, including in February 2024, August 2023, and April 2023, when the company issued statements about quality issues with its 737 products.\n\nIn March 2024, the two companies confirmed that they had begun discussions with Boeing on a possible acquisition deal. Still, Spirit AeroSystems warned that there were no assurances a deal would go through, with the supplier's executives being committed to enhancing shareholder value, regularly reviewing opportunities to do so.\n\nRelated Boeing Considers Purchasing Supplier Spirit Aerosystems A potential merger would bring more of the manufacturing process under Boeing's direct control.", "source": {"uri":

Santiago Paredes, a former quality manager of 12 years at Spirit, accused the firm of rushing safety inspections. He said he would find \"over a hundred defects\" per day when carrying out final inspections.\n\nA former employee of Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems said he nearly developed a fear of flying because of what he saw during his 12-year stint inspecting aircraft fuselages there.\n\nSantiago Paredes, who was a quality manager at Spirit's Wichita facility, told CBS News in a Wednesday report that he would observe \"over a hundred defects every day\" when conducting final inspections of 737 fuselages.\n\n\"Working at Spirit, I almost grew a fear of flying,\" said Paredes. \"There's about two or three units that is in the back of your mind, that you know you would never want to fly on.\"\n\n\"You think there are planes out there that you wouldn't want to fly on?\" CBS senior transport correspondent Kris Van Cleave asked Paredes.\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Paredes said. \"Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly in one of them.\"\n\nBoeing outsources the manufacturing of the 737 fuselage to Spirit and, when assembling the plane at its own facilities, employs a team that finds and fixes defects.\n\nParedes, who left Spirit in 2022, called the operation a \"recipe for disaster.\" He accused the company of fostering a work culture that pressured inspectors to clear fuselages faster so they could hit deadlines.\n\nThe former quality manager said he was even nicknamed the \"Showstopper\" by his bosses because he would delay deliveries by pointing out issues.\n\nHe also told CBS that he often found defects near door panels like the one that blew out midair on an Alaska Airlines 737 flight in January, which prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily ground more than 170 of the planes.\n\nIn February, the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary investigation into the January incident said bolts were missing from the 737 Max 9's door plug.\n\n\"Why'd that happen? Because Spirit let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors,\" Paredes said.\n\nParedes told CBS that he once sent an email pushing back against his managers' requests to speed up inspections and then was removed from his leadership position. He complained to human resources and was later reinstated, but resigned, he told the outlet.\n\nHe is now a whistleblower in a lawsuit against Spirit brought by shareholders. In court documents, he was identified as \"Former Employee 1\" until coming forth to speak publicly about his experience, the BBC reported.\n\nAnother whistleblower at Spirit, John Dean, was also meant to give testimony in the lawsuit but died from a sudden illness in early May.\n\nSpirit has said that the allegations in the lawsuit are false.\n\nParedes' accusations are the latest blow to the embattled Spirit and Boeing, which have both faced intensifying scrutiny after the January door plug incident. The 737 Max has become the subject of criticism from several whistleblowers, who accused the manufacturers of compromising safety standards to fill deliveries more quickly.\n\nBoeing has since begun inspecting fuselages at Spirit's Wichita facility, resulting in a backlog of 737 deliveries that cost Spirit $416 million in operations expenditures in Q1 2024, up from $46 million in the same period last year.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours by Business Insider.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Boeing referred BI to Spirit.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_loh@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Matthew Loh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_flying", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fear of flying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dean", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Dean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/663c76e6b4abc992e8c72c03-scaled.jpg?ver=1715245382", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting.\n\nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\n\nMr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious.\n\nHe also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\n\nMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm.\n\nHowever, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\n\nBefore his departure from the firm, Mr Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.\n\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, and exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed. Spirit said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the assertions in the legal action.\n\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the planemaker's primary supplier. It builds the fuselage for every 737 Max at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, before shipping them to Boeing's own facility in Renton, near Seattle, Washington. It also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIt is now in a difficult position. It is haemorrhaging cash, and lost $617m (\u00a3494m) in the first three months of the year.\n\nBoeing has agreed to provide financial support, and is in talks to buy back its former subsidiary. Sources within the aerospace giant insist that efforts are under way to address quality concerns at Spirit, and these have succeeded in reducing the number of faults in parts leaving the Wichita factory by around 80%.\n\nMr Paredes said both companies were aware of the scale of the problem with defects, and that it was discussed at weekly meetings between quality inspectors from both firms.\n\nMatters came to a head for Mr Paredes personally, he claimed, when he was ordered by his manager to change the way in which defects were reported, in order to reduce their overall number.\n\nAfter he protested, he said, he was demoted and removed to another part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Paredes subsequently filed an \"ethics complaint\" with the company's human resources department, and wrote to Spirit's then chief executive, Tom Gentile.\n\nIn that email, he said \"I have lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help\".\n\nMr Paredes was subsequently reinstated in his leadership role and given back-pay after his complaint was partially upheld. He left the company soon afterwards.\n\nHe now maintains he would be reluctant to fly on a 737 Max, in case it still carried flaws that originated in the Wichita factory.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.\n\nAnd then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying - because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\" - BBC", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastener", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resource management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fundraising", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fundraising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

A spokesman said: \"We are vigorously defending against his claims.\"\n\nBoeing declined to comment to the BBC on Mr Paredes's claims.\n\n'Just focused on meeting quotas'\n\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the US aircraft maker's primary supplier.\n\nIt builds the fuselage for the 737 Max aircraft at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, and also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nMr Paredes claimed he was put under pressure at Spirit to be less rigorous in his quality control inspections.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"They just wanted the product shipped out.\n\n\"They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget ... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nMr Paredes's claims form part of his testimony in legal action that angry shareholders have brought against Spirit.\n\nWhistleblower and former Spirit employee, Josh Dean, whose claims were also part of the lawsuit, died last week from a serious bacterial infection.\n\nMr Dean had been represented by the same legal team as fellow whistleblower and former Boeing employee John Barnett, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in March.\n\nThe supplier, along with Boeing, has been in the spotlight since a door panel was blown out of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing the aircraft into an emergency landing.\n\nAccording to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit.\n\nLast month, another whistleblower made quality control allegations about Boeing's 787 and 777 planes.\n\nBoeing engineer Sam Salehpour claimed his employer took shortcuts while making the 787 which compromised its safety. He also raised issues about the production of the 777, a similar type of jet.\n\nThe American regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, is investigating the allegations.\n\nIn response to Mr Salehpour's claims, Boeing insisted its 787 and 777 models were safe.\n\nIn a statement last month, Boeing said: \"We are fully confident in the 787 Dreamliner because of the comprehensive work done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft.\n\n\"These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate.\"\n\nBoeing planes have experienced other difficulties in recent months.\n\nAt least 50 people were hurt when a Boeing 787, operated by LATAM Airlines, abruptly lost altitude mid-flight from Sydney to Auckland in March.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Boeing 767 belonging to FedEx Express was forced to make an emergency landing at Istanbul Airport after its front landing gear failed.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

(BA) and a significant manufacturer of the 737 Max aircraft, has recently come forward with allegations of being pressured to downplay defects discovered during fuselage inspections.\n\nSantiago Paredes, one of the latest whistleblowers from Boeing, shared his experiences to CBS News shortly after another whistleblower and Spirit AeroSystems employee passed away due to a rapid infection.\n\nDuring his tenure at Spirit AeroSystems from 2010 to 2022, he discovered missing fasteners, bent parts, and even missing parts, which he was pressured to ignore.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems management urged him to limit reporting defects, dubbing him \"Showstopper\" for highlighting defects that would cause delivery delays.\n\nAccording to Paredes, the pressure to minimize defect reports increased in 2018 as Spirit AeroSystems shifted production from approximately 30 fuselages per month to over 50. He was instructed to change defect reporting procedures to reduce logged concerns, which he resisted. As a result, Paredes was demoted and reassigned within the company as retribution for raising alarm about the manufacturing practices.\n\nAfter lodging an ethics complaint Paredes saw some of his grievances addressed, which resulted in the restoration of his leadership role and compensation for lost wages.

Santiago Paredes, the latest whistleblower from Boeing, relayed his experiences to CBS News following the death of another whistleblower and Spirit AeroSystems employee due to a swift infection.Paredes served at Spirit AeroSystems from 2010 to 2022. During his tenure, he uncovered missing fasteners, bent components, and even absent parts, all of which he was pressured to overlook. Spirit AeroSystems' management encouraged him to restrict defect reporting, even nicknaming him \"Showstopper\" for identifying defects that could delay deliveries.According to Paredes, when Spirit AeroSystems ramped up production from roughly 30 to over 50 fuselages per month in 2018, the pressure to diminish defect reports escalated. He was directed to modify defect reporting protocols to lessen documented concerns, an order he didn't comply with. Consequently, Spirit AeroSystems demoted and transferred Paredes, seemingly as punishment for voicing concerns about their manufacturing procedures.Despite having some of his complaints addressed following his ethical grievance, including the reinstatement of his supervisory role and compensation for missed wages, Paredes decided to depart from Spirit AeroSystems. He remarked to CBS News, \"Working at Spirit, I almost developed a fear of flying. Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me incredibly uneasy when I fly on one.\"Paredes' revelations are currently being used as evidence in a lawsuit initiated by unhappy Spirit shareholders, accusing the company of hiding widespread quality problems.

Following the Jan. 5 panel blowout on a 737 MAX, the two parties have been in talks to recombine.\n\nSpirit's cash on hand dropped to $352 million from $824 million at December end. The company posted a net loss of $617 million and burned through $444 million in the three months ended March 28, far more than analysts had expected.\n\n\"The strain on the supply chain being experienced by Spirit and other suppliers is both (a) commercial and an operational risk,\" CEO Pat Shanahan told analysts.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting a cash usage rate of $108 million for the quarter, according to LSEG data.\n\nShares were down 1.9% in Tuesday trading.\n\nBoeing's talks to acquire Spirit have hit a roadblock due to complicated negotiations with Europe's Airbus, which now accounts for roughly one-fifth of Spirit's revenues. Airbus wants to be paid to take on Spirit's money-losing operations, Reuters reported last week.\n\nThe supplier, which makes the 737 MAX fuselage, also has nearly $1.8 billion worth of inventory.\n\nSpirit was already wrestling with money losing programs, and industry-wide supply chain snags that have delayed plane deliveries. The company is also facing added pressure of slumping 737 production due partly to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-imposed quality checks following the January accident.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, Spirit said it was pursuing various options to improve liquidity, including issuing equity or debt financing, undertaking restructuring of its operations and seeking additional customer advances.\n\nAirbus had no immediate comment on Tuesday.\n\n\"The outlook for the share price is wholly dependent on the company reaching a disposal agreement with Boeing and Airbus,\" Vertical Research Partners aerospace analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a note.\n\n\"These results could play a part in this process, as they highlight just how desperate Spirit's financial position has become.\"\n\nSpirit's current Boeing 737 production rate is about 31 fuselages per month, which the company expects to be constant through the end of 2024.\n\nAirlines and lessors have called out both Boeing and Airbus for delivery delays due to production and supply chain challenges.\n\nDubai carrier Emirates' CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said on Tuesday he hoped Boeing's new management will put in the effort to fix delays that have plagued its 777X aircraft.\n\nCompounding Spirit's cost concerns, Boeing has clamped down on traveled work and has said it would take only fuselages that adhere to quality standards. Sales to the U.S. planemaker accounted for 64% of Spirit's revenues last year.\n\nCFO Mark Suchinski said the company recorded a combined $448 million in forward losses, primarily driven by two Airbus programs, the A220 and A350.\n\n\"I know these are large losses but are really due to the inability to reach a conclusion to commercial negotiations with Airbus,\" he told analysts.\n\nThe quarterly adjusted loss per share widened to $3.93 from $1.69, while revenue rose 19% to about $1.7 billion on higher overall sales from its commercial, space and defense programs.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition between Airbus and Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777X", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 777X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emirates (airline)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/OXVVGD7CPBCVBGA55DDC4SRLXQ.JPG?auth=fbf159284fb8da7c243942c4642be1e552c2e14319eefcab0c6408b99a4ed587&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 353, "textEnd": 359}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-28", "textStart": 623, "textEnd": 631}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting. The incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.Mr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious. He also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.WhistleblowingMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm. However, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.Getty ImagesBefore his departure from the firm, Mr Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.A second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.

These figures stand in stark contrast to the anticipated earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.48 and estimated revenue of $1619.66 million, underscoring a turbulent period for the company.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems, a leader in manufacturing aerostructures such as fuselages and wing sections, primarily serves giants like Boeing and Airbus. Since its spin-off from Boeing in 2005, Spirit has become the largest independent supplier of commercial aircraft aerostructures. The company's significant reliance on Boeings 737 program, which represents nearly half of its revenue, exposes it to specific sectoral risks.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 was particularly challenging for Spirit AeroSystems, marked by a 19% increase in revenues year-over-year but overshadowed by a deeper operating loss of $528 million compared to $95 million in the previous year. This deterioration was significantly influenced by disruptions in Boeing 737 production and delivery delays, compounded by an ongoing investigation and quality audits following an incident involving Alaska Airlines.\n\nNet losses widened to $617 million from $281 million year-over-year, with loss per share deepening to $(5.31) from $(2.68). Adjusted EPS, which excludes certain non-recurring items, was also disappointing at $(3.93), reflecting ongoing operational challenges and cost pressures.\n\nThe quarter witnessed several operational setbacks, including delayed Boeing 737 deliveries due to enhanced product verification processes with Boeing, which although aimed at improving production quality and safety, resulted in built-up inventory and strained cash flows. Spirit AeroSystems also faced significant forward losses on the Airbus A350 and A220 programs due to unresolved pricing negotiations and production cost increases.\n\nManagement's commentary highlighted efforts to align costs with factory output and address the abrupt changes in production rates. CEO Pat Shanahan emphasized the strategic measures being implemented to enhance production systems in collaboration with Boeing, aiming to improve overall efficiency and quality.\n\nCash flow positions reflected the operational difficulties, with cash used in operations soaring to $416 million from $46 million in the prior years quarter. The company ended the quarter with $352 million in cash, a steep decline from $824 million at the end of 2023. These figures signal tightening liquidity, prompting management to explore various options to bolster financial flexibility.\n\nGiven the current uncertainties, including ongoing discussions with Boeing regarding potential acquisitions and production schedules, Spirit AeroSystems has withheld financial guidance for the remainder of 2024. The company anticipates further challenges in the second quarter, expecting additional losses driven by lower production volumes and fixed cost absorption issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Spirit AeroSystems faces a critical period of navigating significant operational and financial hurdles. The company's performance this quarter starkly underscores the impacts of production disruptions and elevated costs, necessitating robust strategic responses to stabilize and steer back towards profitability.\n\nFor detailed financial figures and managements discussion on Spirit AeroSystems' performance, visit the full 8-K filing.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Boeing has had a torrid start to 2024 including two whistleblowers who were raising issues about the company dying suddenly. The first of those, John Barnett, took his own life just days after testifying against the aircraft giant, while Joshua Dean died in hospital on Tuesday after a sudden illness following his firing from Spirit AeroSystems in April 2023 and subsequent claims that 'if you are too loud, [Boeing] will silence you.'\n\nSantiago Paredes (pictured), who also worked for Spirit AeroSystems - where the troubled 737 Max is built - at their factory in Kansas , is the latest to speak out, saying he was asked to hide defects on 737 fuselages. 'If quality mattered, I would still be at Spirit,' he said. 'It was very rare for us to look at a job and not find any defects.' He said that he even found a problem with an aircraft door panel that replicated one that flew off during a January flight by Alaska Airlines. 'Why'd that happen? Because Spirit let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors,' Paredes told CBS News.\n\nParedes said he was known as the 'Showstopper,' because his continued insistence on pointing out defects delayed deliveries and that he was constantly pressured to keep his reports to a minimum. 'If the culture was good, those issues would be addressed, but the culture is not good.' Boeing has given Alaska Airlines $61million in supplier credit memos for the disaster which temporarily grounded the fleet of 737 MAX 9 jets. Paredes left the company midway through 2022 after the company had changed his entire outlook on air travel. 'Working at Spirit, I almost grew a fear of flying,' said Paredes. 'Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them.' Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said that their company is supportive of whistleblowers like Paredes. 'We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected,' he said. 'We remain committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards.'\n\nHowever, Paredes was more critical of Boeing, which he said has been ignoring problems at Spirit for years. 'It's a recipe for disaster,' he said. 'I said it was just a matter of time before something bad happened. ' He added that being the 'Showstopper' went against what he felt the ultimate goal of Boeing and Spirit was. Paredes - an Air Force veteran who ended up working 12 years at Spirit - said that things got worse as his time went on, as in 2018 Spirit increased production. 'They always said they didn't have time to fix the mistakes,' said Paredes. 'They needed to get the planes out.' In February of 2022, his bosses asked him to do his inspections faster and become less specific about the defaults, which Paredes described as 'unethical.' 'I was put in a place where I had, if I say, no, I was gonna get fired,' Paredes recalled. 'If I say yes, I was admitting that I was gonna do something wrong.'\n\nThat very summer, he quit after temporarily losing his leadership, which he got back after filing an HR ethics complaint that determined he was improperly demoted. 'It takes a toll on you and I was tired of fighting,' said Paredes. 'I was tired of trying to do the right thing.' Paredes now works for a different Boeing supplier, but he was cited as 'Former Employee 1' in a shareholder lawsuit against Spirit after he blew the whistle. Buccino says Paredes' allegation are 'unfounded' and the company has asked a judge to dismiss the suit. Brian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz, Paredes' lawyers who are working with 10 other current and former Boeing and Spirit workers who have blown the whistle, applauded his courage. 'Santiago Paredes is one of these brave whistleblowers who chose to come forward and speak publicly. His powerful story points to the need for accountability and responsibility in the aviation industry,' they said. 'It is time for profits over safety, quality, and people to come to an end. Actions speak louder than words.'\n\nParedes says that he's not worried about the repercussions in the wake of the two former employees' deaths. 'In a way I think before, if something happens to me, I'd rather them hear it from me than not hear it at all,' he said. 'My cry out is not a cry out to get somebody in trouble. My cry out is to highlight the defects that they well known are in their factory, but they need to fix them. So their business can be successful.' The past year for Boeing has seen consistently damning allegations and behavior at the corporate level. Boeing's 737 Max program chief, Ed Clark, was reportedly fired in February in a structural shakeup at the company. Clark was also general manager at the company's Renton, Washington, facility and had been at Boeing for 18 years. He was replaced by Katie Ringgold, while a 'senior vice president of quality' role was created too.\n\nIn March, Boeing whistleblower John Barnett (pictured), 62 - a former quality control manager and employee of 32 years - was found dead in his truck outside a South Carolina hotel days after testifying against the company in a lawsuit. The coroner put it down to a 'self-inflicted' gunshot wound in the head, though the police confirmed that they would investigate further. Barnett had made a string of complaints to his higher-ups in his time as a quality control manager before leaving the company on health grounds in 2017.\n\nIn January 2024, he appeared on TMZ to say that the 737 Max 9 aircraft were being launched back into the air too soon in the wake of the accident, suggesting corners had been cut. The news came three days after he head of the National Transportation Safety Board accused Boeing of 'not cooperating' with its investigation into the January incident. Several other incidents with Boeing parts occurred throughout February and March.\n\nIn April, another whistleblower, Sam Salehpour (pictured), came forward to Boeing of taking shortcuts when building its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and added that the company had retaliated against him when he raised concerns. He doubled down on the claims a week later, adding on NBC that 787s should be grounded fearing 'fatal flaws' which could case them to fall apart mid-air. In a 1,500 word statement, Boeing said it was 'fully confident' in the 787 and called concerns about structural integrity 'inaccurate.' Later that month, United Airlines indicated it will reduce reliance on Boeing after announcing a $124m loss in the first quarter of 2024, which it blamed on the scandal-laden manufacturer.\n\nOn April 30, a second whistleblower, Joshua Dean (pictured), died suddenly aged 45 having raised the alarm about supposed defects in 737 Max jets. The former Spirit employee previously said he was fired from his quality auditing role for questioning standards at the supplier's plant in Wichita, Kansas, in October 2022. His family said on social media that Dean died in hospital after a sudden illness. Earlier in 2024, Dean spoke with NPR about being fired. 'I think they were sending out a message to anybody else. If you are too loud, we will silence you,' he said.\n\nOn Monday, the FAA announced a new safety investigation into beleaguered jet maker Boeing. The Wall Street Journal reports the target of the investigation is whether Boeing fulfilled safety inspection requirements on all of its troublesome 787 jets. Regulators are saying that Boeing disclosed to them that their employees may have skipped some inspections on 787 Dreamliner planes. The FAA added that it was investigating 'whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He told CBS News and the BBC that he wasn't surprised when missing door bolts led to an entire 737 Max door plug blowing out of an Alaska Airlines flight midair in January.\n\n\"Why'd that happen? Because Spirit let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors,\" Paredes said. \"If the culture was good, those issues would be addressed, but the culture is not good.\"\n\nHe said he would see hundreds of defects in parts on a regular basis, even earning the nickname \"showstopper\" from higher-ups for how frequently he slowed production due to his inspections.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages,\" he continued. \"They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter.\"\n\nFollowing the Alaska Airlines incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all similar 787 Max aircraft and did a complete investigation of the company's parts quality and control infrastructure. Federal investigators said the company's safety culture was \"inadequate and confusing.\"\n\nAfter Paredes complained that Spirit management changed the defect protocol to encourage less reports, he said he was demoted.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nHe was reinstated to a leadership role after filing a complaint but left the company shortly after.\n\nParedes said he's still reticent about flying due to what he experienced at the Boeing subsidiary.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said. \"And then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying - because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\"\n\nSpirit denied Paredes' allegations.\n\n\"We are vigorously defending against his claims,\" a Spirit spokesperson told CBS News.\n\nLast month, a separate Boeing inspector-turned-whistleblower said the company \"absolutely\" has a culture of retaliation against inspectors.\n\n\"In a rush to address the bottlenecks in production, Boeing hit problems, putting pieces together with excessive force to make them appear that the gaps don't exist even though they exist,\" Sam Salehpour said in a Senate hearing. \"The gap didn't actually go away, and this may result in premature fatigue failure. Effectively, they are putting out defective airplanes.\"\n\nBoeing has moved to take over Spirit in the wake of the Alaska Airlines incident and concerns over quality control.\n\nThe company said in March that \"the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_robertson@miamiherald.com", "name": "Nick Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fundraising", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fundraising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/yao17j/picture285305157/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ac11eaea-2a42-4670-a79d-cb91dee3a241", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting.\n\nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\n\nParedes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious.\n\nHe also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nMany of Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm.\n\nHowever, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\n\nBefore his departure from the firm, Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.\n\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, and exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed. Spirit said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the assertions in the legal action.\n\nBoeing support\n\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the planemaker's primary supplier. It builds the fuselage for every 737 Max at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, before shipping them to Boeing's own facility in Renton, near Seattle, Washington. It also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIt is now in a difficult position. It is haemorrhaging cash, and lost $617m (\u00a3494m) in the first three months of the year.\n\nBoeing has agreed to provide financial support, and is in talks to buy back its former subsidiary.\n\nSources within the aerospace giant insist that efforts are under way to address quality concerns at Spirit, and these have succeeded in reducing the number of faults in parts leaving the Wichita factory by around 80%.\n\nParedes said both companies were aware of the scale of the problem with defects, and that it was discussed at weekly meetings between quality inspectors from both firms.\n\n'Cry for help'\n\nMatters came to a head for Paredes personally, he claimed, when he was ordered by his manager to change the way in which defects were reported, in order to reduce their overall number.\n\nAfter he protested, he said, he was demoted and removed to another part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nParedes subsequently filed an \"ethics complaint\" with the company's human resources department, and wrote to Spirit's then chief executive, Tom Gentile.\n\nIn that email, he said \"I have lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help\".\n\nParedes was subsequently reinstated in his leadership role and given back-pay after his complaint was partially upheld. He left the company soon afterwards.\n\nHe now maintains he would be reluctant to fly on a 737 Max, in case it still carried flaws that originated in the Wichita factory.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastener", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resource management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/04/17/boeing787.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

However, a short time later he resigned.\n\nPareres gained the nickname \"The Showstopper\" because his flagging of defective parts would slow up the production line process.

(NYSE: SPR) has reported its first-quarter 2024 earnings, highlighting a mixed financial performance amid efforts to stabilize operations and deliver on customer commitments. The aerospace manufacturer is grappling with production and supply chain issues, particularly with its 787 and 737 programs, which have affected its cash flow and earnings. Despite these challenges, the company has seen a 19% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year and is working closely with key customers Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus to address ongoing issues and secure future production rates.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems remains focused on overcoming its current challenges and positioning itself for long-term success through strategic partnerships and operational improvements. The company's ongoing discussions with Boeing and Airbus are critical to securing its financial position and ensuring it can meet the demands of the global aerospace market.\n\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn this presentation over to Ryan Avey, Senior Director, Investor Relations and FP&A. Please proceed.\n\nRyan Avey: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm Ryan Avey, and with me today are Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Pat.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Let me say at the outset that I am so proud of the Spirit team and particularly proud of what we've accomplished through teamwork. I love this industry, our customers and the people that work in it. And we set out every day to make the industrial system better while ensuring safety, quality and compliance in the supply of our products and services. For Spirit, the primary objectives of stabilizing operations, delivering on our customer commitments and strengthening our company financially have not changed. We are laser-focused and continue to make real progress towards these objectives. Spirit AeroSystems is a critical component of a global network of engineers, manufacturers, customers and governments that comprise the aerospace industry. In that context, I'm going to frame our ongoing efforts. Demand for commercial air travel remains robust and firm. Our collective responsibility at Spirit is to match capacity and capability short and long term. It is a responsibility that defines the company and is at the core of our commitment to our customers. So as the industry prepares to ramp up production, we are diligently working across the industrial system to ensure we possess and demonstrate the capability to deliver on our commitments. Before moving to other topics, I would like to address talks with the Boeing company about a possible acquisition. At the beginning of March, we responded to media speculation by confirming that we are in discussions with Boeing. Those discussions continue, and as all of you understand, I'm not at liberty to comment further. When and if we have something to disclose, we'll make an announcement. At our last earnings call, I spoke about Spirit's rapid response in support of the FAA NTSB Airlines and Boeing resulting from the Alaska air accident. Those actions concentrated on mitigating human factors by improving mechanic proficiency, compliance, mistake proofing and observation. Those systemic changes continue to take root as our foundational relationship with safety and quality matures. Building on that foundation of improvement, we've expanded our actions to strengthen leadership, product conformity and governance. In terms of leadership, Gregg Brown has joined our team as SVP for Global quality. Gregg is an airline operator, an airline safety and quality expert and authority in the management of the FAA's safety management system. He most recently was the Vice President of Technical Operations at JetBlue. Gregg possesses expertise for Airbus and Boeing products having served in the industry and at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) for almost 4 decades. Steps to strengthen product conformity have been significant. The decision was made to fundamentally change the inspection process. This change aligns Spirit and Boeing efforts into a joint inspection. Partnering with Boeing, this transformative undertaking was industrialized in 34 days. Today, working shoulder to shoulder with a standardized 26 zone product verification process, the team's verify conformity on the 737. Each week, the process improves in tandem with quality results being fed back to the teams working in station. Ultimately, our goal is not to streamline this operation but to move it further upstream to where the work is performed. In the interim, utilizing end-to-end digital feedback and analytics, we are accelerating the quality improvements initiated in the first quarter. With critical new building blocks, process changes and insight, we have further reexamined governance. Breakthrough performance and safety and quality will be realized and sustained if teams at the point of production own their operations. We are moving from the office to the factory floor. We're enabling integrated product teams composed of quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, factory operations, supplier management and the customer. This form of governance, which is not new to our industry, provides the requisite authorities, resources, inspiration and motivation that unlocks discretionary effort. This change in governance is early stage, but has the greatest potential. Now I will provide context on cash usage for the quarter. As Boeing mentioned on their call, they deliberately slowed 737 production below 38 per month to incorporate improvements to quality and safety management systems, including reducing traveled work and addressing supplier nonconformances. The inspection process changed by Boeing in effect paused our ability to receive payment for completed fuselages. The implementation of the product verification required that we inspect all the fuselage stored in ship in place utilizing the new conformity process. This represents a total of 54 ship-in place units that needed to flow through the newly established process beginning March 1. In the quarter, we produced 89 units and delivered 44 units prior to implementing the new process. The result was an increase of 45 fuselages to our work in process. To offset the lack of payment but recognizing the completion of fuselages, Boeing Advanced Spirit $425 million to be repaid in the third quarter as the production system returns to equilibrium. We appreciate greatly Boeing's support operationally and financially as we strengthen the industrial system. Boeing is also modifying 787 deliveries due to supply chain challenges. Mark will provide additional detail. However, with the 737 production rate currently at 31 airplanes per month and 787 deliveries approximately 25% below original plans, we will make near-term adjustments to our supply chain to ensure optimal levels of inventory and rate capability. We are closely coordinating with our supplier partners to mitigate the short-term disruption. Our intent is to quickly resynchronize the industrial system while still balancing the capacity and capability to snap back to future production rate increases. The Spirit team is focused on driving our safety and quality efforts, synchronizing supplier partner operations and aligning to meet our commitments to defense customers Airbus and Boeing. Turning to Airbus, as we've discussed on earnings calls over the past year, we've been attempting to reach a commercial agreement in the best interest of both companies. These conversations have yet to result in an agreement. As a result of this impact and the continued pressure on meeting the delivery targets demanded by the rapid rate in the Airbus A350 and 220 programs, we booked significant losses this quarter, including net incremental losses for anticipated performance obligations extending beyond 2026. The strain on the supply chain being experienced by Spirit and other suppliers is both commercial and an operational risk. We have risen to the challenge thus far, and we'll continue to work with Airbus to ensure that quality and safety remain the foremost considerations. And to close, while it's not been the focus of my opening remarks today, I want to highlight the strong performance of the Defense and Aftermarket teams. They continue to execute day in and day out and are performing to their commitments operationally and financially. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will take you through the financials before we open up the call to Q&A. Mark?\n\nMark Suchinski: Thank you, Pat. And good morning, everyone. As Pat covered in his opening remarks, there have been a number of events that have occurred since our last earnings call. I want to discuss the financial impacts of these items before getting into the first quarter results. First, the implementation of Boeing's product verification process on the 737 program, including moving inspections and rework teams from [indiscernible] Wichita while no longer allowing travel work. This has been a collaborative effort to enhance quality and eliminate rework, but consequently has created delayed delivery acceptance in our factories, which has led to the buildup of undelivered units, higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower cash flow. We are working with Boeing to mitigate the slowdown resulting from the process changes. And despite the slow start, we are seeing signs of improvement. And in the long term, expect the benefit to be more synchronized with our customers' inspection process. Over the next few quarters, we expect to have our production systems aligned and built up units delivered. Additionally, we have incurred factory and supply chain costs that were incurred to align with the higher 737 production rate, which has now been delayed. Our current rate is approximately 31 aircraft per month, and we now expect to remain at the lower than planned rate throughout the rest of the year. Similarly, on the 787 program, we are now anticipating delivering approximately 55 units during 2024, down from our original plan of approximately 80. All of these items will have a negative impact on cash flow throughout the year, but I want you to know that we are strongly focused on liquidity and actions to improve our current position. Now let me take you through the details of our first quarter financial results. So let's move to Slide #2. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 19% from the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on our Commercial programs and increased Defense & Space revenues. Overall deliveries in the quarter decreased 11% year-over-year as a result of fewer deliveries recorded on the 737 program due to the reasons I described in my opening remarks. The in-process and completed 737 fuselages that have not been through the new source inspection process are recorded as contract assets and not counted towards our ship set deliveries until accepted. The overtime accounting revenue recognition on these units has been reflected in our quarterly financial results. Now let's turn our attention to EPS. We reported earnings per share of a negative $5.31 compared to negative $2.68 in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $3.93 compared to negative $1.69 in the prior year. Operating margin was lower compared to the same period of 2023, largely driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates during the first quarter of 2024. First quarter net forward losses were $495 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $39 million. This is compared to $110 million of forward losses and $12 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the first quarter of 2023. The current quarter 4 losses were primarily driven by A350 and A220 programs of $281 million and $167 million, respectively. I know these are large losses but are really due to the inability to reach a conclusion to commercial negotiations with Airbus. And as a result, we were required to adjust our assumptions and record forward losses on the A220 and A350 programs, which drove $373 million of total losses. This includes forward losses through 2025, our current accounting contract as well as losses for anticipated performance obligations beyond 2026. The remainder of the forward losses were a result of production cost growth and additional firm orders. Additionally, the 787 program drove $34 million of forward losses due to supply chain and labor cost growth to support future higher production rates. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily related to increased 737 costs associated with the product verification process changes, which caused delayed delivery acceptances and a significant buildup of undelivered units in Wichita. Now turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $444 million compared to free cash flow usage of $69 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily caused by disruption to the 737 production and delivery delay experienced in the period. Having a large number of unbilled 737 units built during the first quarter had a significant negative impact on our first quarter free cash flow. Once these units can be fully inspected under the new product verification process, they will be considered delivered, and we can collect the cash earned on those units. The prior year free cash flow reflects $180 million surplus cash payment received related to the termination of the pension value Plan A. Now with that, let's turn to our cash and debt balances on Slide 3. We ended the quarter with $352 million of cash, which reflects the unfavorable impacts of the disruption experienced on the 737 production and delivery process. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of debt. In April, we entered into an MOA with Boeing to provide cash advances totaling $425 million. These funds were used to address Spirit's high levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows, decreased deliveries and higher factory costs attributed to the change in the product verification process and the FAA's imposition of limitations on the Boeing increased production rates. This advance will be reflected in the second quarter financial results and will be treated as financing activity on the statement of cash flows. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are strongly focused on liquidity and our working plans to improve our current position. Next, let's discuss our quarterly segment performance, along with the Commercial segment on Slide 4. Even with the 737 disruption impacts, Commercial revenue increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher production across most of our programs. Quarterly operating margin decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher changes in estimates recorded in the current period. These changes in estimates included net forward losses of $494 million, which were largely driven by the change in assumptions on our conversations with Airbus and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $39 million. In comparison, during the first quarter of 2023, the segment recorded charges of $110 million of forward losses and $11 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Next, let's turn to Defense & Space segment on Slide 5. We are especially pleased with the performance by the Defense & Space teams this quarter. Revenue grew to $251 million due to higher activity on development and classified programs as well as the Sikorsky CH-53K and FLRAA programs. Operating margin of 13% in the first quarter increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher classified program activities and strong execution by the team. For our Aftermarket segment results, let's now turn to Slide 6. Aftermarket had another solid quarter with revenue of $96 million, up slightly over the prior year, primarily due to higher spare parts sales. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the first quarter of '23, primarily due to lower MRO activity during the current period. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. So our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).\n\nSeth Seifman: I was wondering, Pat and Mark, if you could talk about when we think about the potential deliveries from Spirit this year, and we think about the current production rate of 31, but the deliveries we saw in the first quarter, should we think about the rest of the year as being kind of that 31 per month plus, I guess, the difference between the 89 that were produced and the 44 that were delivered in the first quarter? Or will it take more time to kind of marry up the actual deliveries that can happen with that sort of underlying production rate of 31 a month? I guess, how should we think about that trajectory of deliveries going forward and when those deliveries meet up with the production rate and how the excess fuselages come out over the rest of the year or longer as well.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes, Seth, maybe just think about it this way. We'll be steady state at 31 aircraft per month for the balance of the year. And you might think of that ship in place as a buffer that will allow Boeing to increase to 38 per month when the time is appropriate based on their work with the FAA. So I kind of think of that buffer as surge capacity. Based on the volume that's there, it positions us then to respond should the rate go higher.\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, Seth, just a little bit more color here for you. Let's just focus on Spirit deliveries, okay, where we'll get paid cash. I'd expect the second quarter cash deliveries to be consistent with the first quarter as we work through the product process verification and then we'll see our deliveries increase higher than that in the third and fourth quarter so that for the full year, the deliveries will be roughly 31 a month x 12. So we have some more ship in place Boeing owned inventory that needs to go through the process verification in the second quarter. And then our finished goods will start to follow after that. So delivered units revenue -- or cash delivered units, again, will be consistent with the first quarter, and then we'll see those go higher in the third and fourth quarter.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I wanted to ask about Airbus and the assumptions there. Just what were the assumptions within the A220 and the 350 per pricing given part of the forward loss in the quarter was tied to the failure to reach a new pricing agreement there? And was there some sort of relief assumed in those numbers?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, Sheila, thanks for the question. Yes, there were embedded in our previous assumptions, an assumption on a higher price based on discussions that had ensued at the time. As we said, we haven't been able to come to a conclusion on that. So the forward loss is really represented, I think, in 3 components. Number one is it's a reversal of that pricing benefit that we previously booked. It's additional orders that Airbus booked beyond 2026 on both A350 and A220. And so while we're a stand-alone company, we need to continue to record losses on those future performance obligations. And then there were just some normal cost growth associated with the production. But in my remarks, I said specifically the reversal of those benefits and the additional losses on the future performance obligations were roughly $373 million of the total Airbus losses.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe just to clarify, can you level set us on what sort of cash usage we should assume for the Airbus business in '24 and '25?\n\nMark Suchinski: What I would say is this, Sheila, if you look at our balance sheet and you look at current forward loss reserves or liabilities, I would say that Airbus is about 80% to 85% of those balances. So I think you can do some math from there.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup.\n\nJason Gursky: Pat, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes kind of contextualizing for all of us. The scale of the changes that the ecosystem is going through here. And this idea of reducing traveled work to 0 essentially, I'm guessing is, what's being asked of you. How do you think of a philosophical changes this in aerospace manufacturing? And how difficult is it going to be to achieve what's being asked of you and in turn, what you're asking, I suspect your suppliers to do? I think just big picture, giving us a really good understanding of the task at hand here and how maybe normal this is going to be? Or how unusual this is going to be, I think, would be helpful for all of us here on the call?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Sure, Jason. Let me kind of break it into some different pieces. So when we think about the process that's been stood up here in Wichita, think about it in terms of there are many points along the production system, and I'm going to characterize that as production system for this discussion starts in Wichita and ends when we load a fuselage into the rent in facilities, there are many points along that process where inspections take place. And this effort with Boeing has been to better align all of that activity so that we can take the feedback from those inspections and drive cause corrective action at a very top level, that's what we're talking about. The details are more complicated than that in the sense that in our production system in Wichita, we conduct 9,000 inspections. When you think about the fuselage that we delivered to Boeing, it's 100 feet long and about 12 feet in diameter. It's the largest single integrated commercial aerostructure in the world, and we have very exacting tolerances in which we have to build that to from an engineering standpoint. So when we talk about skin quality, skin quality must be within 10,000 [indiscernible] roughly the thickness of 2 sheets of paper. So when we think about that fuselages about the size of a high school basketball court. And when Boeing says, we expect perfection, they're talking about nothing in excess of 2 sheets of paper thickness. We also install on the skin, 100,000 -- it's about 100,000 fasteners. So there are no fasteners that can have a tolerance greater than what you could detect with your fingernail. So what we've done here is to consolidate all of these inspections where there's a final inspection in Wichita before it goes to Boeing. And when Dave Calhoun talks about clean fuselages, the definition there is what we ship to them, they can load into their first position and immediately put floors down at blankets And the goal is that they can immediately go to work because what we provide to them is the pacing item for all of those installations, we cannot travel any type of work that would disrupt their ability to start on day 1. I think we've made substantial improvement in realigning all the inspections, interpreting the engineering specifications in an exacting manner so that the eyes of Boeing and the eyes of Spirit are the same. And we've been migrating away from humans doing this to digitally inspecting the condition of assembly. It's a long way of saying that we've made step function changes in how we inspect, where we inspect and how we do that together. The benefits in the short term have been we've seen about a 15% improvement in quality. That's just here in the first quarter. My expectation is that by the second half of this year, we'll actually see a step function change in the level of quality. Our ultimate goal is always to drive this back in a position where the work is performed and eliminate the need for so many different inspection points. And I believe that will take place over time and probably faster than most people expect. Maybe I'll stop there and see if that touches on your question.\n\nJason Gursky: Yes. No, it's great. Maybe just one quick follow-up to that. I'm sorry, Ryan, doing that. But -- okay. So it sounds to me like process will get better, learning will happen more quickly, probably more inspections going on here. But does this represent kind of a whole scale change in the way that both you and Boeing are approaching manufacturing? Or is this more kind of an evolutionary kind of thing? And there is a really visible path on how we're going to get all of this done in a relatively timely fashion. I'm just trying to understand how big of a change this really represents and how hard it's going to be?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Well, I think good portion of the hard work is done. The hard work was moving this activity 2,000 miles closer to where the work is being done physically stand up the operation and normalize the inspection process, that work is behind us. We did ran 2 fuselages through the process in March 18, in April. And in the month of May, we'll exceed the production rate of our internal operations. So we'll start to burn down the backlogs. I think the heavy lift has occurred. Now it's really utilizing the findings to rapidly improve the quality and position, which is really the foundation to get to the higher rates. I mean this all supports rate 42, rate 47 and beyond. So that part will be incremental. The big step function of realigning the two companies and where the work is done, I think, is behind us, but it's significant.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays (LON:BARC).\n\nDavid Strauss: One clarification question and my main question. The 55 MAX units that you didn't ship in the quarter but produced, how many of those at this point have gone through this joint verification process and a That's my clarification question. And then my main question on Airbus and the negotiations there, Pat. Has there been any progress on the pricing side? Or did the pricing negotiations kind of get put to the side at this point, given it sounds like you're potentially negotiating with Airbus to take back the A220, A350 work as part of a potential acquisition with -- from Boeing?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Sure. Let me address the first question. Mid-May, we'll start processing the first unit from the finished goods, work in place buffer and then we'll burn those down in terms of the advances we've been paid on by the third quarter. Maybe more broadly to the subject of Airbus, I just maybe start out with we have lots of conversations with Airbus on many different levels. The majority of the conversations tend to focus on the integrity of supply given the significant ramp-ups on the 350 and the 220. And just kind of remind everybody, the ramp-up on the 350 is an increase of 43% this year in addition to delivering the ULR in the first freighter. On the 220 side, it's an increase of 52% in 1 year. So as you can imagine, there's an intensity of conversations going on there. We have never stopped talking about price with Airbus. We haven't made the progress, we've never stopped talking about price. And maybe to the third point, we've explored other economics and different relationship in our production system. And I won't go further there. But there's a path forward on all fronts, and we'll continue to partner with Airbus.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert: I just wanted to follow up on the -- yes, I just wanted to follow up, if I could, on the Airbus side, and I apologize if you you've already addressed this. But what would you characterize for the A220 line, in particular, as sort of incremental investments to support the rates that Airbus has talked about in terms of mid-teens? You're looking at substantial growth this year. I think the growth profile was pretty aggressive over the next few years. And Airbus has been pretty vocal about pushing as much cost on to the supply chain as possible. Can you talk about that investment profile with you to support sort of a mid-teens rate on that particular program, I guess, predominantly, that would be within the Belfast facility?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. Ken, as you said, and Pat just mentioned it, we're talking about a 50-plus percent increase in deliveries in '24 compared to 2023. And then when you do the projection of getting to 14 a month in the '25, '26 time frame, that's essentially more than doubling from where we were last year. So there's no doubt we have capital investments that would be required in our Belfast facility from a property plant and equipment, things like autoclaves and other significant pieces of equipment. So that CapEx has to start to take place in the back half of this year and into 2025 so that we can meet those production rate ramps that our customer is asking for.\n\nKen Herbert: Can you put a finer point on that CapEx? Or maybe another way to ask it, Mark, is what staffing level are you at the Belfast facility and how much hiring would you have to do there to support the higher rate?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. So right now, we're staffed to meet the current requirements. We're not overstaffed there. We're still adding people to support the higher production as we move to the middle and into the back half of the year. So first things first here, as we said, we're looking at delivering somewhere in the ballpark of 90 to 100 units this year. And we did around 60, a little more than that last year. So while we're in the process of bringing those folks on board, we call it green labor, training them, getting them on the bar lines, getting them through the learning process, but we're in the process of hiring those people to support the rate ramp here, but there's more work to be done. As we think about '25 and '26, there will be additional CapEx required. There will be further hiring that will be need to be done and further alignment by the supply chain.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton: Pat, sorry for that piece of blunt, but I know Dave Gitlin took himself out of the potential running for Boeing CEO. I'm curious if you'd care to share your thoughts on your future and your interest in that potential position?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes. No, thanks for the question, Myles. I wake up every single day focused on Spirit, our teammates here, our suppliers, customers and shareholders. And that's my plans.\n\nMyles Walton: Okay. I'm going to go for a second question, that was okay. So the audit that the FAA ran inclusive of Spirit's facilities, can you quantify how many of those sort of failed audits or failed audit points you've addressed and have submitted to Boeing as part of a master schedule of recovery against those audits?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes. I mean just right off the top of my head, I remember that there were 28 findings that were documented and I have to go ask our team, but I'm very confident that every item has been addressed with a mitigating action. And then our focus has really been the follow-up. So I mean it's one thing to have the action plans. The other is to make sure that we're following through. And these were focused on things like tagging of storage parts and scrap materials, I think that's what you're referring to.\n\nMyles Walton: That's right.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: We've followed through on those. But we -- our quality plan was addressed more than what they had audited and those quality plans continue to progress and grow week by week. And as I mentioned before, with the 15% improvement -- and this isn't just on the three seven's across our other programs. The attention and the benefits that we're seeing going to continue to improve week over week and have a lot of confidence in the second half of this year.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.\n\nGeorge Shapiro: Two questions, I guess. One for you, Pat. What gets these Airbus negotiations to some resolution? I mean, I think like by your own admission, you've been on it for 3 to 6 months at this point in time. Do you wind up having to threaten that you're not going to make the investments? Or if you could just provide some color on that? And then, Mark, one for you. The underlying margin to me looked like it was like 5.4% this quarter, down from around 9%. And you had mentioned that there were inefficiencies caused reductions. How much of that reduction was something that was be fixed and how much of it was kind of going to be embedded in the longer-term profit margins?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, George. Let me take the second question, and then Pat can jump in on the Airbus side of things. We talked about the disruption in the first quarter, the standing up of the process to inspect the units and the FAA audits and the NTSB investigation, all of that was very, very disruptive, right? And we continue to enable the operational execution of this inspection process. And so all of that has now been embedded in our contract margins and it's put some pressure on our profit rates and the amounts that we're booking here. I think over the long term, a lot of this is onetime investment that we're making. It's near-term pressure from a cost standpoint. But over the long term, when we think about this and the impact it has on a profitability rates, particularly on the 737 program, we think as we get through the learning and implement this and take the benefits from it that Pat talked about that it won't have a long-term negative impact on the margins. It's just -- it's painful right now. I think we're syncing up the system. Short-term pain right now. We're doing the right things from a business standpoint, and this will pay off as we think about the future.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes. Thanks, Mark. George, maybe to answer your question, my experience in this industry is threats are not effective. And at the end of the day, we all have to work and partner together. But I would just say almost to a fault, we have tried to find solutions to this situation. And our commitment has been to the integrity of supply, and I have share this message time and time again. Financial risk ultimately manifests itself as operational risk. And the system is elastic until it's not. So if you look at what Boeing has done, they've secured supply from us with their agreements. Now we need to do the same with Airbus to protect supply. And we'll continue to have the conversations that we're having, and I am confident that we will come to some type of conclusion.\n\nGeorge Shapiro: But I guess, Pat, I mean, what kind of gets it going to get to that conclusion when you've been working on it for quite a while now.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Well, I think with these production rates, we're going to have to have some of those real family meetings. And that's what it's going to take. But me threatening not to ship them parts or the drama, all of that is not a way to ensure that their customers get their supply. But at the same time, we have to have a financially strong business. And partnerships are the only way to do this, but we'll probably have to have a few more family meetings.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) of UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons: Pat, you mentioned aligning factory costs, but retaining the ability to snap back in rate. Can you just give us a little more detail on what that means for the rate for your own suppliers, if that reflects any workforce changes? And how much notice you'd need to go above 31 per month?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Right. Yes, we spend a lot of time on this subject. So I'll break it into two areas, maybe talk about the supply chain first. When we think of the 3 7, there are 425 critical suppliers. When we talk about suppliers, it's not monolithic. So they're not all the same. They're about 400 suppliers in addition to that, that provide raw material forgings, fasteners. So we treat them differently, but they're a critical part of the supply chain. A big component of what we've been trying to do or what we've been doing is, first of all, communicating formally and informally and then really doing the analysis of where do we need to create critical buffer stock going forward so we'll probably continue with the higher production rate. Where have we had shortages that we need to address in terms of the supply chain limitation? Where do we need buffer stock for programs like the PA? So there's an, I'll say, analysis that goes on around the work statement so that we can snap back to the higher production rates. Then there's a set of discussions around the suppliers themselves that the buyers perform to make sure they're viable that they can continue to produce now. We don't have the check book to support the whole supply chain or do we have enough warehouse space to store all of the goods that would come through. So it's a balancing act that we're performing now. The good news is this isn't COVID, so we're talking months, not years. And this is reality of our industry where we have these kinds of disruptions and we'll roll up our sleeves and figure out a way for everybody to get through this, break, break. When we think about our internal operations, what I've said to the team is that our teammates aren't 100% variable with rate, okay? It doesn't make sense to go up and down and have people go in and out the door. We've invested a lot in their training, they're critical part of our company. So we're trying to find the right balance here. So as the system recovers, we don't go through a quality issue or a training issue and repeat some of the things that it is hard coming out of COVID. We're talking about smaller numbers, not big numbers like we did with the shutdown of COVID. But it's a balance of financials and then maintaining a bridge of talent. We'll have to make some decisions here in the next couple of weeks, which we're prepared to do. Those decisions will be preceded by conversations, the union, other constituencies, but I think we've got a very solid approach to being able to respond quickly as Boeing turns their rates back up.\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. Gavin, I would just add because it's a bit of a follow-up on the margin conversation here. As Pat just said, to protect the future production rates, we're going to be carrying some additional costs, right? And it's going to have a near-term impact to profitability and cash. But it's the best thing for the long term. As Pat said, this is -- we're going to be going up in rate. The production, the demand is there. And so we're working very hard to protect the production system while balancing our financial situation at the same time.\n\nGavin Parsons: Great. I appreciate the detail. If I could just confirm, I heard you say 31 per month x 12, so about 370 MAX deliveries for the year?\n\nCai von Rumohr: So Pat, what about labor availability and attrition? Maybe talk about Wichita because Textron (NYSE:TXT) also has been building? And talk also about when we talk to -- about Ireland and the plant there and the ability to get folks to be able to surge by 50%?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Sure, Cai. Labor scarcity is a challenge to the industry. We look at what are the big issues. Forgings, raw material and labor come to the top of the list. So here long term in Wichita, one is, it's a great part of the country for talent and skill where we need to go to market differently. I mean there's a lot of skill that we have to train for that's differently than we have done in the past. So you said as your approach to hiring people going to be different than it has been in the past, it definitely will. We have a different workforce. What we've found so far is when we train them with the basics, they're just as talented and as committed as their predecessors. So -- but I think how we recruit and how we train is an important part of getting these higher production rates. We have similar challenges in the marketplace in Northern Ireland. But I think it's not as industrialized when you kind of think about the Textrons of the world competing for the same type of labor, but labor is always a challenge. Attrition hasn't been a problem for us. And I think these production rates, it's always hard to strike the balance of when you bring people on so that you aren't unnecessarily spending money, but at the same time, give people enough training so that they're prepared they can produce of the quality that's required.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird.\n\nPeter Arment: Mark, maybe I could just ask quickly on Defense. Really good performance in the quarter. I'm just wondering if there was any kind of one-offs on that margin rate of 12 8? Or how sustainable that is just given the nice performance?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. Thanks, Peter. We've historically said we target on our Defense program somewhere between 12% to 14%. And I think we were right in the sweet spot there. So there were no what I would consider to be significant benefits that we recorded. I think it was just really good execution on the contracts that we have. The last couple of quarters, we've had some challenges on the CH-53K. Our team there has done a wonderful job of really improving the production processes, and I think they're working very hard to please our Sikorsky customer there. So again, nothing significant, either good or bad. I think as we think about that business going forward, we expect our team to perform. And if they do, we should continue to perform to the margin targets that we've put out there.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.\n\nMichael Ciarmoli: Pat, maybe just a quick two-parter here. I mean, how much if you can tell us what percent of your assets in Wichita IP tooling is already owned by Boeing? And then, obviously, we throw in some of the advances. You're still repaying them on each 787. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of if there was a transaction, how much value do they already own? And then the other follow-on to that is you're making all these wholesale changes, improving the inspection, process quality. Presumably, that will improve out-year margins and cash. Why is it a good move for shareholders to potentially sell to Boeing?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, Michael, let me just kind of address your questions around assets and IP. And I guess your question was specifically around Wichita. In our industry -- and it's consistent with whether it's any OEM. The OEMs typically own the tooling associated with the production of their products. The facilities, call it, the brick-and-mortar, the property, plant and equipment, whether it's tape laying machines, autoclaves, broaches to drill holes, that equipment is owned by Spirit, right? So for the most part, it's a fully functioning business. It's consistent, whether it's in the U.S. or overseas. As it relates to IP, a lot of that just depends on the contract, right? It could be joint ownership, sole ownership. But I think that's the way I would characterize it. It's -- they own the tooling and Spirit owns the rest of the assets used in the production of the products that we build for whether it's Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), et cetera.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Maybe I'll just answer the broader question that you asked, the value of reintegration of most of these operations can only be unlocked by the OEM. And when we think of supply chain optimization, whether it's forging, raw materials, fasteners, things that are needed for the higher production rates, that's a significant amount of value they can unlock. Same goes for internal operations in terms of safety, quality, delivery cost. In the case of Spirit, whether it's the wing of the fuselage on the 220 or the fuselage of the 737, so largest part of the build material for those major programs. It really represents another opportunity to drive efficiency. The kind of the broader value proposition is sharpening engineering and manufacturing expertise for the future. And that's a skill that's hard to acquire. So whether you're Brothers or Bombardier, their [indiscernible] 100 years, depth of expertise that's here at Spirit and Wichita is similar. So -- but quite often, it's really only the OEM can unlock that value.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our Q&A session. I would like to thank you all for joining today's call.

(NYSE:SPR) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024\n\nSpirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $ EPS, expectations were $-0.44. SPR isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn this presentation over to Ryan Avey, Senior Director, Investor Relations and FP&A. Please proceed.\n\nRyan Avey: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm Ryan Avey, and with me today are Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Pat.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Let me say at the outset that I am so proud of the Spirit team and particularly proud of what we've accomplished through teamwork. I love this industry, our customers and the people that work in it. And we set out every day to make the industrial system better while ensuring safety, quality and compliance in the supply of our products and services. For Spirit, the primary objectives of stabilizing operations, delivering on our customer commitments and strengthening our company financially have not changed. We are laser-focused and continue to make real progress towards these objectives. Spirit AeroSystems is a critical component of a global network of engineers, manufacturers, customers and governments that comprise the aerospace industry.\n\nIn that context, I'm going to frame our ongoing efforts. Demand for commercial air travel remains robust and firm. Our collective responsibility at Spirit is to match capacity and capability short and long term. It is a responsibility that defines the company and is at the core of our commitment to our customers. So as the industry prepares to ramp up production, we are diligently working across the industrial system to ensure we possess and demonstrate the capability to deliver on our commitments. Before moving to other topics, I would like to address talks with the Boeing company about a possible acquisition. At the beginning of March, we responded to media speculation by confirming that we are in discussions with Boeing. Those discussions continue, and as all of you understand, I'm not at liberty to comment further.\n\nWhen and if we have something to disclose, we'll make an announcement. At our last earnings call, I spoke about Spirit's rapid response in support of the FAA NTSB Airlines and Boeing resulting from the Alaska air accident. Those actions concentrated on mitigating human factors by improving mechanic proficiency, compliance, mistake proofing and observation. Those systemic changes continue to take root as our foundational relationship with safety and quality matures. Building on that foundation of improvement, we've expanded our actions to strengthen leadership, product conformity and governance. In terms of leadership, Gregg Brown has joined our team as SVP for Global quality. Gregg is an airline operator, an airline safety and quality expert and authority in the management of the FAA's safety management system.\n\nHe most recently was the Vice President of Technical Operations at JetBlue. Gregg possesses expertise for Airbus and Boeing products having served in the industry and at Southwest Airlines for almost 4 decades. Steps to strengthen product conformity have been significant. The decision was made to fundamentally change the inspection process. This change aligns Spirit and Boeing efforts into a joint inspection. Partnering with Boeing, this transformative undertaking was industrialized in 34 days. Today, working shoulder to shoulder with a standardized 26 zone product verification process, the team's verify conformity on the 737. Each week, the process improves in tandem with quality results being fed back to the teams working in station. Ultimately, our goal is not to streamline this operation but to move it further upstream to where the work is performed.\n\nIn the interim, utilizing end-to-end digital feedback and analytics, we are accelerating the quality improvements initiated in the first quarter. With critical new building blocks, process changes and insight, we have further reexamined governance. Breakthrough performance and safety and quality will be realized and sustained if teams at the point of production own their operations. We are moving from the office to the factory floor. We're enabling integrated product teams composed of quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, factory operations, supplier management and the customer. This form of governance, which is not new to our industry, provides the requisite authorities, resources, inspiration and motivation that unlocks discretionary effort.\n\nThis change in governance is early stage, but has the greatest potential. Now I will provide context on cash usage for the quarter. As Boeing mentioned on their call, they deliberately slowed 737 production below 38 per month to incorporate improvements to quality and safety management systems, including reducing traveled work and addressing supplier nonconformances. The inspection process changed by Boeing in effect paused our ability to receive payment for completed fuselages. The implementation of the product verification required that we inspect all the fuselage stored in ship in place utilizing the new conformity process. This represents a total of 54 ship-in place units that needed to flow through the newly established process beginning March 1.\n\nIn the quarter, we produced 89 units and delivered 44 units prior to implementing the new process. The result was an increase of 45 fuselages to our work in process. To offset the lack of payment but recognizing the completion of fuselages, Boeing Advanced Spirit $425 million to be repaid in the third quarter as the production system returns to equilibrium. We appreciate greatly Boeing's support operationally and financially as we strengthen the industrial system. Boeing is also modifying 787 deliveries due to supply chain challenges. Mark will provide additional detail. However, with the 737 production rate currently at 31 airplanes per month and 787 deliveries approximately 25% below original plans, we will make near-term adjustments to our supply chain to ensure optimal levels of inventory and rate capability.\n\nWe are closely coordinating with our supplier partners to mitigate the short-term disruption. Our intent is to quickly resynchronize the industrial system while still balancing the capacity and capability to snap back to future production rate increases. The Spirit team is focused on driving our safety and quality efforts, synchronizing supplier partner operations and aligning to meet our commitments to defense customers Airbus and Boeing. Turning to Airbus, as we've discussed on earnings calls over the past year, we've been attempting to reach a commercial agreement in the best interest of both companies. These conversations have yet to result in an agreement. As a result of this impact and the continued pressure on meeting the delivery targets demanded by the rapid rate in the Airbus A350 and 220 programs, we booked significant losses this quarter, including net incremental losses for anticipated performance obligations extending beyond 2026.\n\nThe strain on the supply chain being experienced by Spirit and other suppliers is both commercial and an operational risk. We have risen to the challenge thus far, and we'll continue to work with Airbus to ensure that quality and safety remain the foremost considerations. And to close, while it's not been the focus of my opening remarks today, I want to highlight the strong performance of the Defense and Aftermarket teams. They continue to execute day in and day out and are performing to their commitments operationally and financially. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will take you through the financials before we open up the call to Q&A. Mark?\n\nMark Suchinski: Thank you, Pat. And good morning, everyone. As Pat covered in his opening remarks, there have been a number of events that have occurred since our last earnings call. I want to discuss the financial impacts of these items before getting into the first quarter results. First, the implementation of Boeing's product verification process on the 737 program, including moving inspections and rework teams from [indiscernible] Wichita while no longer allowing travel work. This has been a collaborative effort to enhance quality and eliminate rework, but consequently has created delayed delivery acceptance in our factories, which has led to the buildup of undelivered units, higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower cash flow.\n\nWe are working with Boeing to mitigate the slowdown resulting from the process changes. And despite the slow start, we are seeing signs of improvement. And in the long term, expect the benefit to be more synchronized with our customers' inspection process. Over the next few quarters, we expect to have our production systems aligned and built up units delivered. Additionally, we have incurred factory and supply chain costs that were incurred to align with the higher 737 production rate, which has now been delayed. Our current rate is approximately 31 aircraft per month, and we now expect to remain at the lower than planned rate throughout the rest of the year. Similarly, on the 787 program, we are now anticipating delivering approximately 55 units during 2024, down from our original plan of approximately 80.\n\nAll of these items will have a negative impact on cash flow throughout the year, but I want you to know that we are strongly focused on liquidity and actions to improve our current position. Now let me take you through the details of our first quarter financial results. So let's move to Slide #2. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 19% from the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on our Commercial programs and increased Defense & Space revenues. Overall deliveries in the quarter decreased 11% year-over-year as a result of fewer deliveries recorded on the 737 program due to the reasons I described in my opening remarks. The in-process and completed 737 fuselages that have not been through the new source inspection process are recorded as contract assets and not counted towards our ship set deliveries until accepted.\n\nThe overtime accounting revenue recognition on these units has been reflected in our quarterly financial results. Now let's turn our attention to EPS. We reported earnings per share of a negative $5.31 compared to negative $2.68 in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $3.93 compared to negative $1.69 in the prior year. Operating margin was lower compared to the same period of 2023, largely driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates during the first quarter of 2024. First quarter net forward losses were $495 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $39 million. This is compared to $110 million of forward losses and $12 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe current quarter 4 losses were primarily driven by A350 and A220 programs of $281 million and $167 million, respectively. I know these are large losses but are really due to the inability to reach a conclusion to commercial negotiations with Airbus. And as a result, we were required to adjust our assumptions and record forward losses on the A220 and A350 programs, which drove $373 million of total losses. This includes forward losses through 2025, our current accounting contract as well as losses for anticipated performance obligations beyond 2026. The remainder of the forward losses were a result of production cost growth and additional firm orders. Additionally, the 787 program drove $34 million of forward losses due to supply chain and labor cost growth to support future higher production rates.\n\nThe unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily related to increased 737 costs associated with the product verification process changes, which caused delayed delivery acceptances and a significant buildup of undelivered units in Wichita. Now turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $444 million compared to free cash flow usage of $69 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily caused by disruption to the 737 production and delivery delay experienced in the period. Having a large number of unbilled 737 units built during the first quarter had a significant negative impact on our first quarter free cash flow. Once these units can be fully inspected under the new product verification process, they will be considered delivered, and we can collect the cash earned on those units.\n\nThe prior year free cash flow reflects $180 million surplus cash payment received related to the termination of the pension value Plan A. Now with that, let's turn to our cash and debt balances on Slide 3. We ended the quarter with $352 million of cash, which reflects the unfavorable impacts of the disruption experienced on the 737 production and delivery process. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of debt. In April, we entered into an MOA with Boeing to provide cash advances totaling $425 million. These funds were used to address Spirit's high levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows, decreased deliveries and higher factory costs attributed to the change in the product verification process and the FAA's imposition of limitations on the Boeing increased production rates.\n\nThis advance will be reflected in the second quarter financial results and will be treated as financing activity on the statement of cash flows. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are strongly focused on liquidity and our working plans to improve our current position. Next, let's discuss our quarterly segment performance, along with the Commercial segment on Slide 4. Even with the 737 disruption impacts, Commercial revenue increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher production across most of our programs. Quarterly operating margin decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher changes in estimates recorded in the current period. These changes in estimates included net forward losses of $494 million, which were largely driven by the change in assumptions on our conversations with Airbus and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $39 million.\n\nIn comparison, during the first quarter of 2023, the segment recorded charges of $110 million of forward losses and $11 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Next, let's turn to Defense & Space segment on Slide 5. We are especially pleased with the performance by the Defense & Space teams this quarter. Revenue grew to $251 million due to higher activity on development and classified programs as well as the Sikorsky CH-53K and FLRAA programs. Operating margin of 13% in the first quarter increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher classified program activities and strong execution by the team. For our Aftermarket segment results, let's now turn to Slide 6. Aftermarket had another solid quarter with revenue of $96 million, up slightly over the prior year, primarily due to higher spare parts sales.\n\nOperating margin in the first quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the first quarter of '23, primarily due to lower MRO activity during the current period. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nSee also", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

'It was very rare for us to look at a job and not find any defects.'\n\nSantiago Paredes, who worked for Spirit AeroSystems - where the troubled 737 Max is built - at their factory in Kansas, is the latest to speak out, saying he was asked to hide defects on 737 fuselages\n\nJoshua Dean died in hospital on Tuesday after a sudden illness following his firing from Spirit AeroSystems in April 2023\n\nHe said that even found a problem with an aircraft door panel that replicated one that flew off during a January flight by Alaska Airlines.\n\n'Why'd that happen? Because Spirit let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors,' Paredes told CBS News.\n\nParedes said he was known as the 'Showstopper,' because his continued insistence on pointing out defects delayed deliveries and that he was constantly pressured to keep his reports to a minimum.\n\n'If the culture was good, those issues would be addressed, but the culture is not good.'\n\nBoeing has given Alaska Airlines $61million in supplier credit memos for the disaster which temporarily grounded the fleet of 737 MAX 9 jets.\n\nParedes left the company midway through 2022 after the company had changed his entire outlook on air travel.\n\n'Working at Spirit, I almost grew a fear of flying,' said Paredes. 'Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them.'\n\nSpirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said that their company is supportive of whistleblowers like Paredes.\n\nJohn Barnett, took his own life just days after testifying against the aircraft giant\n\nJoshua Dean died in hospital on Tuesday after a sudden illness following his firing from Spirit AeroSystems in April 2023 and subsequent claims that 'if you are too loud, [Boeing] will silence you'\n\nBoeing engineer, Sam Salehpour testifies before the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations during a hearing on 'Examining Boeing's Broken Safety Culture: Firsthand Accounts,' at Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on April 17\n\n'We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected,' he said.\n\n'We remain committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards.'\n\nHowever, Paredes was more critical of Boeing, which he said has been ignoring problems at Spirit for years.\n\n'It's a recipe for disaster,' he said. 'I said it was just a matter of time before something bad happened. '\n\nHe added that being the 'Showstopper' went against what he felt the ultimate goal of Boeing and Spirit was.\n\nParedes - an Air Force veteran who ended up working 12 years at Spirit - said that things got worse as his time went on, as in 2018 Spirit increased production.\n\n'They always said they didn't have time to fix the mistakes,' said Paredes. 'They needed to get the planes out.'\n\nIn February of 2022, his bosses asked him to do his inspections faster and become less specific about the defaults, which Paredes described as 'unethical.'\n\nParedes said that even found a problem with an aircraft door panel that replicated one that flew off during a January flight by Alaska Airlines\n\nParedes worked for Spirit AeroSystems - where the troubled 737 Max is built - at their factory in Kansas\n\n'I was put in a place where I had, if I say, no, I was gonna get fired,' Paredes recalled. 'If I say yes, I was admitting that I was gonna do something wrong.'\n\nThat very summer, he quit after temporarily losing his leadership, which he got back after filing an HR ethics complaint that determined he was improperly demoted.\n\n'It takes a toll on you and I was tired of fighting,' said Paredes. 'I was tired of trying to do the right thing.'\n\nParedes now works for a different Boeing supplier, but he was cited as 'Former Employee 1' in a shareholder lawsuit against Spirit after he blew the whistle.\n\nBuccino says Paredes' allegation are 'unfounded' and the company has asked a judge to dismiss the suit.\n\nBrian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz, Paredes' lawyers who are working with 10 other current and former Boeing and Spirit workers who have blown the whistle, applauded his courage.\n\n'Santiago Paredes is one of these brave whistleblowers who chose to come forward and speak publicly. His powerful story points to the need for accountability and responsibility in the aviation industry,' they said.\n\n'It is time for profits over safety, quality, and people to come to an end. Actions speak louder than words.'\n\nDozens of grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are seen parked in an aerial photo at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S. July 1, 2019. Picture taken July 1, 2019\n\nThere were no serious injuries from the terrifying Alaska Airlines failure, but passenger's belongings including phones flew out of the aircraft\n\nParedes says that he's not worried about the repercussions in the wake of the two former employees' deaths.\n\n'In a way I think before, if something happens to me, I'd rather them hear it from me than not hear it at all,' he said.\n\n'My cry out is not a cry out to get somebody in trouble. My cry out is to highlight the defects that they well known are in their factory, but they need to fix them.

First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn this presentation over to Ryan Avey, Senior Director, Investor Relations and FP&A. Please proceed.\n\nRyan Avey: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm Ryan Avey, and with me today are Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Pat.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Let me say at the outset that I am so proud of the Spirit team and particularly proud of what we've accomplished through teamwork. I love this industry, our customers and the people that work in it. And we set out every day to make the industrial system better while ensuring safety, quality and compliance in the supply of our products and services. For Spirit, the primary objectives of stabilizing operations, delivering on our customer commitments and strengthening our company financially have not changed. We are laser-focused and continue to make real progress towards these objectives. Spirit AeroSystems is a critical component of a global network of engineers, manufacturers, customers and governments that comprise the aerospace industry. In that context, I'm going to frame our ongoing efforts. Demand for commercial air travel remains robust and firm. Our collective responsibility at Spirit is to match capacity and capability short and long term. It is a responsibility that defines the company and is at the core of our commitment to our customers. So as the industry prepares to ramp up production, we are diligently working across the industrial system to ensure we possess and demonstrate the capability to deliver on our commitments. Before moving to other topics, I would like to address talks with the Boeing company about a possible acquisition. At the beginning of March, we responded to media speculation by confirming that we are in discussions with Boeing. Those discussions continue, and as all of you understand, I'm not at liberty to comment further. When and if we have something to disclose, we'll make an announcement. At our last earnings call, I spoke about Spirit's rapid response in support of the FAA NTSB Airlines and Boeing resulting from the Alaska air accident. Those actions concentrated on mitigating human factors by improving mechanic proficiency, compliance, mistake proofing and observation. Those systemic changes continue to take root as our foundational relationship with safety and quality matures. Building on that foundation of improvement, we've expanded our actions to strengthen leadership, product conformity and governance. In terms of leadership, Gregg Brown has joined our team as SVP for Global quality. Gregg is an airline operator, an airline safety and quality expert and authority in the management of the FAA's safety management system. He most recently was the Vice President of Technical Operations at JetBlue. Gregg possesses expertise for Airbus and Boeing products having served in the industry and at Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV ) for almost 4 decades. Steps to strengthen product conformity have been significant. The decision was made to fundamentally change the inspection process. This change aligns Spirit and Boeing efforts into a joint inspection. Partnering with Boeing, this transformative undertaking was industrialized in 34 days. Today, working shoulder to shoulder with a standardized 26 zone product verification process, the team's verify conformity on the 737. Each week, the process improves in tandem with quality results being fed back to the teams working in station. Ultimately, our goal is not to streamline this operation but to move it further upstream to where the work is performed. In the interim, utilizing end-to-end digital feedback and analytics, we are accelerating the quality improvements initiated in the first quarter. With critical new building blocks, process changes and insight, we have further reexamined governance. Breakthrough performance and safety and quality will be realized and sustained if teams at the point of production own their operations. We are moving from the office to the factory floor. We're enabling integrated product teams composed of quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, factory operations, supplier management and the customer. This form of governance, which is not new to our industry, provides the requisite authorities, resources, inspiration and motivation that unlocks discretionary effort. This change in governance is early stage, but has the greatest potential. Now I will provide context on cash usage for the quarter. As Boeing mentioned on their call, they deliberately slowed 737 production below 38 per month to incorporate improvements to quality and safety management systems, including reducing traveled work and addressing supplier nonconformances. The inspection process changed by Boeing in effect paused our ability to receive payment for completed fuselages. The implementation of the product verification required that we inspect all the fuselage stored in ship in place utilizing the new conformity process. This represents a total of 54 ship-in place units that needed to flow through the newly established process beginning March 1. In the quarter, we produced 89 units and delivered 44 units prior to implementing the new process. The result was an increase of 45 fuselages to our work in process. To offset the lack of payment but recognizing the completion of fuselages, Boeing Advanced Spirit $425 million to be repaid in the third quarter as the production system returns to equilibrium. We appreciate greatly Boeing's support operationally and financially as we strengthen the industrial system. Boeing is also modifying 787 deliveries due to supply chain challenges. Mark will provide additional detail. However, with the 737 production rate currently at 31 airplanes per month and 787 deliveries approximately 25% below original plans, we will make near-term adjustments to our supply chain to ensure optimal levels of inventory and rate capability. We are closely coordinating with our supplier partners to mitigate the short-term disruption. Our intent is to quickly resynchronize the industrial system while still balancing the capacity and capability to snap back to future production rate increases. The Spirit team is focused on driving our safety and quality efforts, synchronizing supplier partner operations and aligning to meet our commitments to defense customers Airbus and Boeing. Turning to Airbus, as we've discussed on earnings calls over the past year, we've been attempting to reach a commercial agreement in the best interest of both companies. These conversations have yet to result in an agreement. As a result of this impact and the continued pressure on meeting the delivery targets demanded by the rapid rate in the Airbus A350 and 220 programs, we booked significant losses this quarter, including net incremental losses for anticipated performance obligations extending beyond 2026. The strain on the supply chain being experienced by Spirit and other suppliers is both commercial and an operational risk. We have risen to the challenge thus far, and we'll continue to work with Airbus to ensure that quality and safety remain the foremost considerations. And to close, while it's not been the focus of my opening remarks today, I want to highlight the strong performance of the Defense and Aftermarket teams. They continue to execute day in and day out and are performing to their commitments operationally and financially. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will take you through the financials before we open up the call to Q&A. Mark?\n\nMark Suchinski: Thank you, Pat. And good morning, everyone. As Pat covered in his opening remarks, there have been a number of events that have occurred since our last earnings call. I want to discuss the financial impacts of these items before getting into the first quarter results. First, the implementation of Boeing's product verification process on the 737 program, including moving inspections and rework teams from [indiscernible] Wichita while no longer allowing travel work. This has been a collaborative effort to enhance quality and eliminate rework, but consequently has created delayed delivery acceptance in our factories, which has led to the buildup of undelivered units, higher levels of inventory and contract assets and lower cash flow. We are working with Boeing to mitigate the slowdown resulting from the process changes. And despite the slow start, we are seeing signs of improvement. And in the long term, expect the benefit to be more synchronized with our customers' inspection process. Over the next few quarters, we expect to have our production systems aligned and built up units delivered. Additionally, we have incurred factory and supply chain costs that were incurred to align with the higher 737 production rate, which has now been delayed. Our current rate is approximately 31 aircraft per month, and we now expect to remain at the lower than planned rate throughout the rest of the year. Similarly, on the 787 program, we are now anticipating delivering approximately 55 units during 2024, down from our original plan of approximately 80. All of these items will have a negative impact on cash flow throughout the year, but I want you to know that we are strongly focused on liquidity and actions to improve our current position. Now let me take you through the details of our first quarter financial results. So let's move to Slide #2. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 19% from the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on our Commercial programs and increased Defense & Space revenues. Overall deliveries in the quarter decreased 11% year-over-year as a result of fewer deliveries recorded on the 737 program due to the reasons I described in my opening remarks. The in-process and completed 737 fuselages that have not been through the new source inspection process are recorded as contract assets and not counted towards our ship set deliveries until accepted. The overtime accounting revenue recognition on these units has been reflected in our quarterly financial results. Now let's turn our attention to EPS. We reported earnings per share of a negative $5.31 compared to negative $2.68 in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $3.93 compared to negative $1.69 in the prior year. Operating margin was lower compared to the same period of 2023, largely driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates during the first quarter of 2024. First quarter net forward losses were $495 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $39 million. This is compared to $110 million of forward losses and $12 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the first quarter of 2023. The current quarter 4 losses were primarily driven by A350 and A220 programs of $281 million and $167 million, respectively. I know these are large losses but are really due to the inability to reach a conclusion to commercial negotiations with Airbus. And as a result, we were required to adjust our assumptions and record forward losses on the A220 and A350 programs, which drove $373 million of total losses. This includes forward losses through 2025, our current accounting contract as well as losses for anticipated performance obligations beyond 2026. The remainder of the forward losses were a result of production cost growth and additional firm orders. Additionally, the 787 program drove $34 million of forward losses due to supply chain and labor cost growth to support future higher production rates. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily related to increased 737 costs associated with the product verification process changes, which caused delayed delivery acceptances and a significant buildup of undelivered units in Wichita. Now turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $444 million compared to free cash flow usage of $69 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily caused by disruption to the 737 production and delivery delay experienced in the period. Having a large number of unbilled 737 units built during the first quarter had a significant negative impact on our first quarter free cash flow. Once these units can be fully inspected under the new product verification process, they will be considered delivered, and we can collect the cash earned on those units. The prior year free cash flow reflects $180 million surplus cash payment received related to the termination of the pension value Plan A. Now with that, let's turn to our cash and debt balances on Slide 3. We ended the quarter with $352 million of cash, which reflects the unfavorable impacts of the disruption experienced on the 737 production and delivery process. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of debt. In April, we entered into an MOA with Boeing to provide cash advances totaling $425 million. These funds were used to address Spirit's high levels of inventory and contract assets, lower operational cash flows, decreased deliveries and higher factory costs attributed to the change in the product verification process and the FAA's imposition of limitations on the Boeing increased production rates. This advance will be reflected in the second quarter financial results and will be treated as financing activity on the statement of cash flows. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are strongly focused on liquidity and our working plans to improve our current position. Next, let's discuss our quarterly segment performance, along with the Commercial segment on Slide 4. Even with the 737 disruption impacts, Commercial revenue increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher production across most of our programs. Quarterly operating margin decreased compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher changes in estimates recorded in the current period. These changes in estimates included net forward losses of $494 million, which were largely driven by the change in assumptions on our conversations with Airbus and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $39 million. In comparison, during the first quarter of 2023, the segment recorded charges of $110 million of forward losses and $11 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Next, let's turn to Defense & Space segment on Slide 5. We are especially pleased with the performance by the Defense & Space teams this quarter. Revenue grew to $251 million due to higher activity on development and classified programs as well as the Sikorsky CH-53K and FLRAA programs. Operating margin of 13% in the first quarter increased compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher classified program activities and strong execution by the team. For our Aftermarket segment results, let's now turn to Slide 6. Aftermarket had another solid quarter with revenue of $96 million, up slightly over the prior year, primarily due to higher spare parts sales. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the first quarter of '23, primarily due to lower MRO activity during the current period. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. So our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ).\n\nSeth Seifman: I was wondering, Pat and Mark, if you could talk about when we think about the potential deliveries from Spirit this year, and we think about the current production rate of 31, but the deliveries we saw in the first quarter, should we think about the rest of the year as being kind of that 31 per month plus, I guess, the difference between the 89 that were produced and the 44 that were delivered in the first quarter? Or will it take more time to kind of marry up the actual deliveries that can happen with that sort of underlying production rate of 31 a month? I guess, how should we think about that trajectory of deliveries going forward and when those deliveries meet up with the production rate and how the excess fuselages come out over the rest of the year or longer as well.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes, Seth, maybe just think about it this way. We'll be steady state at 31 aircraft per month for the balance of the year. And you might think of that ship in place as a buffer that will allow Boeing to increase to 38 per month when the time is appropriate based on their work with the FAA. So I kind of think of that buffer as surge capacity. Based on the volume that's there, it positions us then to respond should the rate go higher.\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, Seth, just a little bit more color here for you. Let's just focus on Spirit deliveries, okay, where we'll get paid cash. I'd expect the second quarter cash deliveries to be consistent with the first quarter as we work through the product process verification and then we'll see our deliveries increase higher than that in the third and fourth quarter so that for the full year, the deliveries will be roughly 31 a month x 12. So we have some more ship in place Boeing owned inventory that needs to go through the process verification in the second quarter. And then our finished goods will start to follow after that. So delivered units revenue -- or cash delivered units, again, will be consistent with the first quarter, and then we'll see those go higher in the third and fourth quarter.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I wanted to ask about Airbus and the assumptions there. Just what were the assumptions within the A220 and the 350 per pricing given part of the forward loss in the quarter was tied to the failure to reach a new pricing agreement there? And was there some sort of relief assumed in those numbers?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, Sheila, thanks for the question. Yes, there were embedded in our previous assumptions, an assumption on a higher price based on discussions that had ensued at the time. As we said, we haven't been able to come to a conclusion on that. So the forward loss is really represented, I think, in 3 components. Number one is it's a reversal of that pricing benefit that we previously booked. It's additional orders that Airbus booked beyond 2026 on both A350 and A220. And so while we're a stand-alone company, we need to continue to record losses on those future performance obligations. And then there were just some normal cost growth associated with the production. But in my remarks, I said specifically the reversal of those benefits and the additional losses on the future performance obligations were roughly $373 million of the total Airbus losses.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe just to clarify, can you level set us on what sort of cash usage we should assume for the Airbus business in '24 and '25?\n\nMark Suchinski: What I would say is this, Sheila, if you look at our balance sheet and you look at current forward loss reserves or liabilities, I would say that Airbus is about 80% to 85% of those balances. So I think you can do some math from there.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup.\n\nJason Gursky: Pat, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes kind of contextualizing for all of us. The scale of the changes that the ecosystem is going through here. And this idea of reducing traveled work to 0 essentially, I'm guessing is, what's being asked of you. How do you think of a philosophical changes this in aerospace manufacturing? And how difficult is it going to be to achieve what's being asked of you and in turn, what you're asking, I suspect your suppliers to do? I think just big picture, giving us a really good understanding of the task at hand here and how maybe normal this is going to be? Or how unusual this is going to be, I think, would be helpful for all of us here on the call?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Sure, Jason. Let me kind of break it into some different pieces. So when we think about the process that's been stood up here in Wichita, think about it in terms of there are many points along the production system, and I'm going to characterize that as production system for this discussion starts in Wichita and ends when we load a fuselage into the rent in facilities, there are many points along that process where inspections take place. And this effort with Boeing has been to better align all of that activity so that we can take the feedback from those inspections and drive cause corrective action at a very top level, that's what we're talking about. The details are more complicated than that in the sense that in our production system in Wichita, we conduct 9,000 inspections. When you think about the fuselage that we delivered to Boeing, it's 100 feet long and about 12 feet in diameter. It's the largest single integrated commercial aerostructure in the world, and we have very exacting tolerances in which we have to build that to from an engineering standpoint. So when we talk about skin quality, skin quality must be within 10,000 [indiscernible] roughly the thickness of 2 sheets of paper. So when we think about that fuselages about the size of a high school basketball court. And when Boeing says, we expect perfection, they're talking about nothing in excess of 2 sheets of paper thickness. We also install on the skin, 100,000 -- it's about 100,000 fasteners. So there are no fasteners that can have a tolerance greater than what you could detect with your fingernail. So what we've done here is to consolidate all of these inspections where there's a final inspection in Wichita before it goes to Boeing. And when Dave Calhoun talks about clean fuselages, the definition there is what we ship to them, they can load into their first position and immediately put floors down at blankets And the goal is that they can immediately go to work because what we provide to them is the pacing item for all of those installations, we cannot travel any type of work that would disrupt their ability to start on day 1. I think we've made substantial improvement in realigning all the inspections, interpreting the engineering specifications in an exacting manner so that the eyes of Boeing and the eyes of Spirit are the same. And we've been migrating away from humans doing this to digitally inspecting the condition of assembly. It's a long way of saying that we've made step function changes in how we inspect, where we inspect and how we do that together. The benefits in the short term have been we've seen about a 15% improvement in quality. That's just here in the first quarter. My expectation is that by the second half of this year, we'll actually see a step function change in the level of quality. Our ultimate goal is always to drive this back in a position where the work is performed and eliminate the need for so many different inspection points. And I believe that will take place over time and probably faster than most people expect. Maybe I'll stop there and see if that touches on your question.\n\nJason Gursky: Yes. No, it's great. Maybe just one quick follow-up to that. I'm sorry, Ryan, doing that. But -- okay. So it sounds to me like process will get better, learning will happen more quickly, probably more inspections going on here. But does this represent kind of a whole scale change in the way that both you and Boeing are approaching manufacturing? Or is this more kind of an evolutionary kind of thing? And there is a really visible path on how we're going to get all of this done in a relatively timely fashion. I'm just trying to understand how big of a change this really represents and how hard it's going to be?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Well, I think good portion of the hard work is done. The hard work was moving this activity 2,000 miles closer to where the work is being done physically stand up the operation and normalize the inspection process, that work is behind us. We did ran 2 fuselages through the process in March 18, in April. And in the month of May, we'll exceed the production rate of our internal operations. So we'll start to burn down the backlogs. I think the heavy lift has occurred. Now it's really utilizing the findings to rapidly improve the quality and position, which is really the foundation to get to the higher rates. I mean this all supports rate 42, rate 47 and beyond. So that part will be incremental. The big step function of realigning the two companies and where the work is done, I think, is behind us, but it's significant.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays (LON: BARC ).\n\nDavid Strauss: One clarification question and my main question. The 55 MAX units that you didn't ship in the quarter but produced, how many of those at this point have gone through this joint verification process and a That's my clarification question. And then my main question on Airbus and the negotiations there, Pat. Has there been any progress on the pricing side? Or did the pricing negotiations kind of get put to the side at this point, given it sounds like you're potentially negotiating with Airbus to take back the A220, A350 work as part of a potential acquisition with -- from Boeing?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Sure. Let me address the first question. Mid-May, we'll start processing the first unit from the finished goods, work in place buffer and then we'll burn those down in terms of the advances we've been paid on by the third quarter. Maybe more broadly to the subject of Airbus, I just maybe start out with we have lots of conversations with Airbus on many different levels. The majority of the conversations tend to focus on the integrity of supply given the significant ramp-ups on the 350 and the 220. And just kind of remind everybody, the ramp-up on the 350 is an increase of 43% this year in addition to delivering the ULR in the first freighter. On the 220 side, it's an increase of 52% in 1 year. So as you can imagine, there's an intensity of conversations going on there. We have never stopped talking about price with Airbus. We haven't made the progress, we've never stopped talking about price. And maybe to the third point, we've explored other economics and different relationship in our production system. And I won't go further there. But there's a path forward on all fronts, and we'll continue to partner with Airbus.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert: I just wanted to follow up on the -- yes, I just wanted to follow up, if I could, on the Airbus side, and I apologize if you you've already addressed this. But what would you characterize for the A220 line, in particular, as sort of incremental investments to support the rates that Airbus has talked about in terms of mid-teens? You're looking at substantial growth this year. I think the growth profile was pretty aggressive over the next few years. And Airbus has been pretty vocal about pushing as much cost on to the supply chain as possible. Can you talk about that investment profile with you to support sort of a mid-teens rate on that particular program, I guess, predominantly, that would be within the Belfast facility?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. Ken, as you said, and Pat just mentioned it, we're talking about a 50-plus percent increase in deliveries in '24 compared to 2023. And then when you do the projection of getting to 14 a month in the '25, '26 time frame, that's essentially more than doubling from where we were last year. So there's no doubt we have capital investments that would be required in our Belfast facility from a property plant and equipment, things like autoclaves and other significant pieces of equipment. So that CapEx has to start to take place in the back half of this year and into 2025 so that we can meet those production rate ramps that our customer is asking for.\n\nKen Herbert: Can you put a finer point on that CapEx? Or maybe another way to ask it, Mark, is what staffing level are you at the Belfast facility and how much hiring would you have to do there to support the higher rate?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. So right now, we're staffed to meet the current requirements. We're not overstaffed there. We're still adding people to support the higher production as we move to the middle and into the back half of the year. So first things first here, as we said, we're looking at delivering somewhere in the ballpark of 90 to 100 units this year. And we did around 60, a little more than that last year. So while we're in the process of bringing those folks on board, we call it green labor, training them, getting them on the bar lines, getting them through the learning process, but we're in the process of hiring those people to support the rate ramp here, but there's more work to be done. As we think about '25 and '26, there will be additional CapEx required. There will be further hiring that will be need to be done and further alignment by the supply chain.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton: Pat, sorry for that piece of blunt, but I know Dave Gitlin took himself out of the potential running for Boeing CEO. I'm curious if you'd care to share your thoughts on your future and your interest in that potential position?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes. No, thanks for the question, Myles. I wake up every single day focused on Spirit, our teammates here, our suppliers, customers and shareholders. And that's my plans.\n\nMyles Walton: Okay. I'm going to go for a second question, that was okay. So the audit that the FAA ran inclusive of Spirit's facilities, can you quantify how many of those sort of failed audits or failed audit points you've addressed and have submitted to Boeing as part of a master schedule of recovery against those audits?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes. I mean just right off the top of my head, I remember that there were 28 findings that were documented and I have to go ask our team, but I'm very confident that every item has been addressed with a mitigating action. And then our focus has really been the follow-up. So I mean it's one thing to have the action plans. The other is to make sure that we're following through. And these were focused on things like tagging of storage parts and scrap materials, I think that's what you're referring to.\n\nMyles Walton: That's right.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: We've followed through on those. But we -- our quality plan was addressed more than what they had audited and those quality plans continue to progress and grow week by week. And as I mentioned before, with the 15% improvement -- and this isn't just on the three seven's across our other programs. The attention and the benefits that we're seeing going to continue to improve week over week and have a lot of confidence in the second half of this year.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.\n\nGeorge Shapiro: Two questions, I guess. One for you, Pat. What gets these Airbus negotiations to some resolution? I mean, I think like by your own admission, you've been on it for 3 to 6 months at this point in time. Do you wind up having to threaten that you're not going to make the investments? Or if you could just provide some color on that? And then, Mark, one for you. The underlying margin to me looked like it was like 5.4% this quarter, down from around 9%. And you had mentioned that there were inefficiencies caused reductions. How much of that reduction was something that was be fixed and how much of it was kind of going to be embedded in the longer-term profit margins?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, George. Let me take the second question, and then Pat can jump in on the Airbus side of things. We talked about the disruption in the first quarter, the standing up of the process to inspect the units and the FAA audits and the NTSB investigation, all of that was very, very disruptive, right? And we continue to enable the operational execution of this inspection process. And so all of that has now been embedded in our contract margins and it's put some pressure on our profit rates and the amounts that we're booking here. I think over the long term, a lot of this is onetime investment that we're making. It's near-term pressure from a cost standpoint. But over the long term, when we think about this and the impact it has on a profitability rates, particularly on the 737 program, we think as we get through the learning and implement this and take the benefits from it that Pat talked about that it won't have a long-term negative impact on the margins. It's just -- it's painful right now. I think we're syncing up the system. Short-term pain right now. We're doing the right things from a business standpoint, and this will pay off as we think about the future.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Yes. Thanks, Mark. George, maybe to answer your question, my experience in this industry is threats are not effective. And at the end of the day, we all have to work and partner together. But I would just say almost to a fault, we have tried to find solutions to this situation. And our commitment has been to the integrity of supply, and I have share this message time and time again. Financial risk ultimately manifests itself as operational risk. And the system is elastic until it's not. So if you look at what Boeing has done, they've secured supply from us with their agreements. Now we need to do the same with Airbus to protect supply. And we'll continue to have the conversations that we're having, and I am confident that we will come to some type of conclusion.\n\nGeorge Shapiro: But I guess, Pat, I mean, what kind of gets it going to get to that conclusion when you've been working on it for quite a while now.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Well, I think with these production rates, we're going to have to have some of those real family meetings. And that's what it's going to take. But me threatening not to ship them parts or the drama, all of that is not a way to ensure that their customers get their supply. But at the same time, we have to have a financially strong business. And partnerships are the only way to do this, but we'll probably have to have a few more family meetings.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons (NYSE: PSN ) of UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons: Pat, you mentioned aligning factory costs, but retaining the ability to snap back in rate. Can you just give us a little more detail on what that means for the rate for your own suppliers, if that reflects any workforce changes? And how much notice you'd need to go above 31 per month?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Right. Yes, we spend a lot of time on this subject. So I'll break it into two areas, maybe talk about the supply chain first. When we think of the 3 7, there are 425 critical suppliers. When we talk about suppliers, it's not monolithic. So they're not all the same. They're about 400 suppliers in addition to that, that provide raw material forgings, fasteners. So we treat them differently, but they're a critical part of the supply chain. A big component of what we've been trying to do or what we've been doing is, first of all, communicating formally and informally and then really doing the analysis of where do we need to create critical buffer stock going forward so we'll probably continue with the higher production rate. Where have we had shortages that we need to address in terms of the supply chain limitation? Where do we need buffer stock for programs like the PA? So there's an, I'll say, analysis that goes on around the work statement so that we can snap back to the higher production rates. Then there's a set of discussions around the suppliers themselves that the buyers perform to make sure they're viable that they can continue to produce now. We don't have the check book to support the whole supply chain or do we have enough warehouse space to store all of the goods that would come through. So it's a balancing act that we're performing now. The good news is this isn't COVID, so we're talking months, not years. And this is reality of our industry where we have these kinds of disruptions and we'll roll up our sleeves and figure out a way for everybody to get through this, break, break. When we think about our internal operations, what I've said to the team is that our teammates aren't 100% variable with rate, okay? It doesn't make sense to go up and down and have people go in and out the door. We've invested a lot in their training, they're critical part of our company. So we're trying to find the right balance here. So as the system recovers, we don't go through a quality issue or a training issue and repeat some of the things that it is hard coming out of COVID. We're talking about smaller numbers, not big numbers like we did with the shutdown of COVID. But it's a balance of financials and then maintaining a bridge of talent. We'll have to make some decisions here in the next couple of weeks, which we're prepared to do. Those decisions will be preceded by conversations, the union, other constituencies, but I think we've got a very solid approach to being able to respond quickly as Boeing turns their rates back up.\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. Gavin, I would just add because it's a bit of a follow-up on the margin conversation here. As Pat just said, to protect the future production rates, we're going to be carrying some additional costs, right? And it's going to have a near-term impact to profitability and cash. But it's the best thing for the long term. As Pat said, this is -- we're going to be going up in rate. The production, the demand is there. And so we're working very hard to protect the production system while balancing our financial situation at the same time.\n\nGavin Parsons: Great. I appreciate the detail. If I could just confirm, I heard you say 31 per month x 12, so about 370 MAX deliveries for the year?\n\nCai von Rumohr: So Pat, what about labor availability and attrition? Maybe talk about Wichita because Textron (NYSE: TXT ) also has been building? And talk also about when we talk to -- about Ireland and the plant there and the ability to get folks to be able to surge by 50%?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Sure, Cai. Labor scarcity is a challenge to the industry. We look at what are the big issues. Forgings, raw material and labor come to the top of the list. So here long term in Wichita, one is, it's a great part of the country for talent and skill where we need to go to market differently. I mean there's a lot of skill that we have to train for that's differently than we have done in the past. So you said as your approach to hiring people going to be different than it has been in the past, it definitely will. We have a different workforce. What we've found so far is when we train them with the basics, they're just as talented and as committed as their predecessors. So -- but I think how we recruit and how we train is an important part of getting these higher production rates. We have similar challenges in the marketplace in Northern Ireland. But I think it's not as industrialized when you kind of think about the Textrons of the world competing for the same type of labor, but labor is always a challenge. Attrition hasn't been a problem for us. And I think these production rates, it's always hard to strike the balance of when you bring people on so that you aren't unnecessarily spending money, but at the same time, give people enough training so that they're prepared they can produce of the quality that's required.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird.\n\nPeter Arment: Mark, maybe I could just ask quickly on Defense. Really good performance in the quarter. I'm just wondering if there was any kind of one-offs on that margin rate of 12 8? Or how sustainable that is just given the nice performance?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes. Thanks, Peter. We've historically said we target on our Defense program somewhere between 12% to 14%. And I think we were right in the sweet spot there. So there were no what I would consider to be significant benefits that we recorded. I think it was just really good execution on the contracts that we have. The last couple of quarters, we've had some challenges on the CH-53K. Our team there has done a wonderful job of really improving the production processes, and I think they're working very hard to please our Sikorsky customer there. So again, nothing significant, either good or bad. I think as we think about that business going forward, we expect our team to perform. And if they do, we should continue to perform to the margin targets that we've put out there.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.\n\nMichael Ciarmoli: Pat, maybe just a quick two-parter here. I mean, how much if you can tell us what percent of your assets in Wichita IP tooling is already owned by Boeing? And then, obviously, we throw in some of the advances. You're still repaying them on each 787. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of if there was a transaction, how much value do they already own? And then the other follow-on to that is you're making all these wholesale changes, improving the inspection, process quality. Presumably, that will improve out-year margins and cash. Why is it a good move for shareholders to potentially sell to Boeing?\n\nMark Suchinski: Yes, Michael, let me just kind of address your questions around assets and IP. And I guess your question was specifically around Wichita. In our industry -- and it's consistent with whether it's any OEM. The OEMs typically own the tooling associated with the production of their products. The facilities, call it, the brick-and-mortar, the property, plant and equipment, whether it's tape laying machines, autoclaves, broaches to drill holes, that equipment is owned by Spirit, right? So for the most part, it's a fully functioning business. It's consistent, whether it's in the U.S. or overseas. As it relates to IP, a lot of that just depends on the contract, right? It could be joint ownership, sole ownership. But I think that's the way I would characterize it. It's -- they own the tooling and Spirit owns the rest of the assets used in the production of the products that we build for whether it's Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier (OTC: BDRBF ), et cetera.\n\nPatrick Shanahan: Maybe I'll just answer the broader question that you asked, the value of reintegration of most of these operations can only be unlocked by the OEM. And when we think of supply chain optimization, whether it's forging, raw materials, fasteners, things that are needed for the higher production rates, that's a significant amount of value they can unlock. Same goes for internal operations in terms of safety, quality, delivery cost. In the case of Spirit, whether it's the wing of the fuselage on the 220 or the fuselage of the 737, so largest part of the build material for those major programs. It really represents another opportunity to drive efficiency. The kind of the broader value proposition is sharpening engineering and manufacturing expertise for the future. And that's a skill that's hard to acquire. So whether you're Brothers or Bombardier, their [indiscernible] 100 years, depth of expertise that's here at Spirit and Wichita is similar. So -- but quite often, it's really only the OEM can unlock that value.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our Q&A session. I would like to thank you all for joining today's call.

Santiago Parades, a quality manager at Spirit AeroSystems for 12 years, revealed Wednesday that he spotted so many defects at his job that he \"almost grew a fear of flying.\" Parades' statement parallels several other reports regarding quality defects aboard the 737 Max, Boeing's most troubled plane.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems -- which, despite the name, has nothing to do with Spirit Airlines -- is one of Boeing's biggest suppliers. It's responsible for building or shipping most components of the 737 Max. Alaska, United, Southwest, and American Airlines each use the 737 Max for at least some of their commercial flights, with American adding 150 new units to its fleet in March. That's one month after Boeing found so many 737 Max build errors -- directly related to work performed at Spirit AeroSystems -- that it held back about 50 deliveries.\n\nNow, it appears Boeing's February discovery was just the beginning. In an interview with CBS this week, Parades, who implied that he'd left Spirit AeroSystems in mid-2022 due to the lack of quality he witnessed there, said it was \"very rare\" for his team to look at a 737 Max job and not find any defects. It was a \"recipe for disaster,\" Parades said, and \"just a matter of time before something bad happened.\"\n\nSomething bad did happen this January when the door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight popped out of a 737 Max shortly after takeoff. Nobody was badly injured, and the pilot quickly redirected the plane back to the airport from which it had just departed. However, the incident redirected public attention to 737 Max build errors after roughly three years of relative silence. (The 737 Max had come under fire for flight control, anti-stall system, and general design flaws in 2019 and 2020.) In the months following, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) worked to investigate the blown-out door plug by requesting build and repair documentation for the aircraft. Still, Boeing claimed all relevant information had been deleted.\n\n\"Why'd that happen? Because Spirit let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors,\" Paredes said about the incident. \"If the culture was good, those issues would be addressed, but the culture is not good.\" He added, \"If quality mattered, [he] would still be at Spirit.\"\n\n\"Working at Spirit, I almost grew a fear of flying,\" said Paredes. \"There's about two or three units that is in [sic] the back of your mind, that you know you would never want to fly on. Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly in one of them.\"", "source": {"uri": "extremetech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExtremeTech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adrianna_nine@extremetech.com", "name": "Adrianna Nine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_flying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fear of flying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fundraising", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fundraising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.extremetech.com/imagery/content-types/04nnNZGS3wZlAGGJPOd88b2/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

(KSNW) -- Spirit AeroSystems is giving workers and investors a better idea of what is affecting the bottom line these days. On Tuesday, the Wichita-based company released its latest financial results -- a loss of $616.7 million in the first quarter.\n\nSpirit President and CEO Pat Shanahan and Chief Financial Officer Mark Suchinski held a news conference after the report was released.\n\nThey discussed Boeing possibly buying the company, a slowdown in production, the Spirit AeroSystems' workforce, and an ongoing issue with Airbus.\n\nBefore tackling the financial details, Shanahan talked about Boeing possibly buying Spirit.\n\n\"Those discussions continue and, as all of you understand, I am not at liberty to comment further,\" he said. \"When and if we have something to disclose, we'll make an announcement.\"\n\nHe was asked what the value of an acquisition would be for Spirit's investors.\n\n\"The broader value proposition is sharpening engineering and manufacturing expertise for the future. That's a skill that's hard to acquire,\" Shanahan said. \"Whether you're a Short Brothers of Bombardier that roots trace back 100 years, you know, the depth of expertise that's here at Spirit in Wichita is similar.\"\n\nShanahan said several factors are hurting the company's finances. One is the slowdown in production that started after a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 in January. The plane was forced to make an emergency landing.\n\nBoeing slowed 737 production below 38 a month in order to add quality and safety measures. Measures that Shanahan supports.\n\n\"The Spirit team is focused on driving our safety and quality efforts,\" he said. \"We've made step function changes in how we inspect, where we inspect and how we do that together. The benefits in the short term have been we've seen about a 15% improvement in quality.\"\n\nHowever, Shanahan said Boeing's inspection process change, in effect, paused Spirit's ability to receive payment for completed fuselages. Boeing has advanced Spirit $425 million.\n\nThe 737 product rate is currently at 31 airplanes a month.\n\n\"We now expect to remain at the lower-than-planned rate throughout the rest of the year,\" Suchinski said. \"Similarly, on the 787 program, we are now anticipating delivering approximately 55 units during 2024, down from our original plan of approximately 80. All of these items will have a negative impact on cash flow throughout the year, but I want you to know we are strongly focused on liquidity and actions to improve our current position.\"\n\nSpirit's president says a slowdown in the production rate does not necessarily mean the number of employees will drop.\n\n\"Our teammates aren't 100% variable with rate,\" Shanahan said. \"It doesn't make sense to go up and down and have people go in and out the door. We've invested a lot in their training.\"\n\nOf the 21,000 employees Spirit has worldwide, 12,500 work at its Wichita plant.\n\n\"They're a critical part of our company, so we're trying to find the right balance here, so as the system recovers, we don't go through the quality issue or a training issue and repeat some of the things that hit us hard coming out of COVID,\" he said. \"We're talking about smaller numbers, not big numbers like we did with the shutdown of COVID, but it's a balance of financials and maintaining a bridge of talent.\"\n\nShanahan said Spirit will have to make some decisions in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\"Those decisions will be preceded by conversations with the union, other constituencies, but I think we've got a very solid approach to being able to respond quickly as Boeing turns their rates back up,\" he said.\n\nSuchinski said the company needs to protect future production rates.\n\n\"We're going to be carrying some additional costs, and it's going to have a near-term impact on profitability and cash, but it's the best thing for the long-term,\" he said. \"As Pat said, we're going to be going up in rate. The production, the demand is there, and so we're working very hard to protect the production system while balancing our financial situation at the same time.\"\n\nThe company says its stalled price negotiation with Airbus also hurts the bottom line.\n\n\"As a result of this impasse and the continued pressure on meeting the delivery targets demanded by the rapid rate in the Airbus A350 and 220 programs, we've booked significant losses this quarter,\" Shanahan said.\n\n\"If you look at our balance sheet and you look at current forward loss reserves or liabilities, I would say that Airbus is about 80 to 85% of those balances,\" Suchinski said.\n\nShanahan said Airbus wants to ramp up production of the A350 by 43% this year. It also wants an increase of 52% on the A220 in one year.\n\n\"As you can imagine, there's an intensity of conversations going on there,\" he said. \"We have never stopped talking about price with Airbus. We haven't made the progress we want, but we've never stopped talking about price.\"\n\nHe said the conversations continue on many different levels.\n\n\"We have risen to the challenge thus far and will continue to work with Airbus to ensure that quality and safety remain the foremost considerations,\" Shanahan said.\n\nDuring the news conference on Tuesday, Shanahan was asked if he has any interest in becoming the new CEO at Boeing. The current CEO, David Calhoun, plans to retire at the end of the year.\n\n\"I wake up every single day focused on Spirit, our teammates here, our suppliers, customers and shareholders, and that's my plan,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ksn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_mcmillan@ksn.com", "name": "Laura McMillan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Brothers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A220", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A220"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liability (financial accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ksn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2023/04/spirit-aerosystems.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Because Spirit let go of a defect that they overlooked because of the pressure that they put on the inspectors,\" Paredes told CBS News. \"If the culture was good, those issues would be addressed, but the culture is not good.\"\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board Investigation indicates that the Alaska Airlines door panel was removed during final assembly to allow a Spirit AeroSystems team to make defect repairs, but it appears the bolts holding the panel in place were not reinstalled.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems, not affiliated with Spirit Airlines, was spun off from Boeing nearly 20 years ago. The company has been under scrutiny since the Federal Aviation Administration imposed quality checks and halted production expansion of the 737 Max following the January Alaska Airlines accident.\n\nParedes, who left the company in mid-2022, told CBS News that what he saw firsthand makes him hesitant to fly on those planes.\n\n\"Working at Spirit, I almost grew a fear of flying,\" said Paredes. \"Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them.\"\n\n\"We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected,\" said Spirit spokesman Joe Buccino. \"We remain committed to addressing concerns and continuously improving workplace safety standards.\"\n\nCBS News spoke with several current and former Spirit AeroSystems employees and reviewed photos of dented fuselages, missing fasteners and even a wrench they say was left behind in a supposedly ready-to-deliver component. Paredes said Boeing knew for years Spirit was delivering defective fuselages.\n\n\"It's a recipe for disaster,\" Paredes told us. \"I said it was just a matter of time before something bad happened. \"\n\nA Boeing spokesperson told CBS News the company has long had a team that finds and fixes defects in fuselages built by Spirit AeroSystems as Boeing assembled the planes. The spokesperson said since the beginning of March, Boeing engineers have been inspecting each Spirit fuselage as it rolls off the production line in Wichita.\n\nBoeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in a recent interview with CNBC the increased oversight in Kansas has reduced the number of fuselages with defects, or what Boeing calls 'nonconformities,\" arriving at the 737 assembly plant in Washington State by about 80 percent. The company is currently weighing buying back Spirit AeroSystems to further improve quality. Boeing spun off Spirit, formerly known as Boeing Wichita, in 2005.\n\nDuring its earning call this week, Spirit CEO Patrick Shanahan noted an improvement in quality from the newly implemented inspection protocols noting a 15 percent improvement in quality during the first quarter.\n\n\"I think we've made substantial improvement in realigning all the inspections, interpreting the engineering specifications in an exacting manner so that the eyes of Boeing and the eyes of Spirit are the same,\" Shanahan said.\n\nShanahan became CEO in October of 2023 following Boeing's discovery of mis-drilled holes on many 737 Max fuselages received from Spirit that had to be repaired by Boeing.\n\nAccording to Paredes, managers at Spirit AeroSystems would pressure him to keep his reports of defects to a minimum. He says his bosses referred to him by the nickname \"Showstopper,\" because the defects he would write up as needing to be repaired would delay deliveries. Eventually, Paredes says, the pressure got worse beginning in 2018 as Spirit went from producing fuselages in the mid-30s monthly, to more than 50 a month.\n\n\"They always said they didn't have time to fix the mistakes,\" said Paredes. \"They needed to get the planes out.\"\n\nIn February 2022, Paredes said Spirit bosses asked him to speed up his inspections by being less specific about where exactly he was finding issues with fuselages. Paredes emailed his managers, writing the request was \"unethical\" and put him \"in a very uncomfortable situation.\"\n\n\"I was put in a place where I had, if I say, no, I was gonna get fired,\" Paredes recalled. \"If I say yes, I was admitting that I was gonna do something wrong.\"\n\nAfter sending that email, Paredes was stripped from his team leadership position. He filed an ethics complaint with the company's Human Resources department, and says he was eventually reinstated after the company found he was wrongfully demoted. But Paredes said he'd had enough and resigned from Spirit in the summer of 2022.\n\n\"It takes a toll on you and I was tired of fighting,\" said Paredes. \"I was tired of trying to do the right thing.\"\n\nParedes, an Air Force veteran, spent 12 years at Spirit AeroSystems' Wichita plant before leaving in 2022 to work for another Boeing supplier. In a shareholder lawsuit against Spirit, Paredes was cited as \"Former Employee 1\" alleging \"widespread quality failures\" at the company -- failures that Paredes says their client, Boeing, was aware of.\n\nBuccino, the Spirit spokesman, calls the allegations \"unfounded.\"\n\nThe company has asked a judge to dismiss the shareholder lawsuit, arguing, in part, the fact that Paredes was reinstated after it was found he was wrongfully demoted following his ethics complaint is proof the company values quality control.\n\n\"Santiago Paredes is one of these brave whistleblowers who chose to come forward and speak publicly. His powerful story points to the need for accountability and responsibility in the aviation industry,\" his attorneys Brian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz told CBS News. \"It is time for profits over safety, quality, and people to come to an end. Actions speak louder than words.\"\n\nThe lawyers say they are working with at least 10 former and current Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems employees who have raised safety concerns.\n\nParedes is not the only whistleblower to speak out publicly on quality issues relating to Boeing planes.\n\nIn March, John \"Mitch\" Barnett was in the midst of depositions relating to his claims Boeing retaliated against him for complaints about quality lapses when he was found in his car dead from a gunshot wound in Charleston, South Carolina, where Boeing has its 787 manufacturing facility.\n\nJoshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Spirit AeroSystems, was one of the first to allege Spirit leadership had ignored manufacturing defects on the 737 Max. Dean had given a deposition in the same shareholder lawsuit Paredes is listed in, alleging that Spirit \"has a culture of not wanting to look for or to find problems, which has led to poor decisions about quality and manufacturing issues.\"\n\nDean died last month, after a struggle with a sudden infection.\n\n\"In a way I think before, if something happens to me, I'd rather them hear it from me than not hear it at all,\" Paredes says about going public. \"My cry out is not a cry out to get somebody in trouble. My cry out is to highlight the defects that they well known are in their factory, but they need to fix them. So their business can be successful.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Paredes",

According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting.\n\nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\n\nMr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious.\n\nHe also claimed he was put him under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget... If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\n\nMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm.\n\nHowever, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Parades, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\n\nBefore his departure from the firm, Mr Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.\n\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, an exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed. Spirit said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the assertions in the legal action.\n\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the planemaker's primary supplier. It builds the fuselage for every 737 Max at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, before shipping them to Boeing's own facility in Renton, near Seattle, Washington. It also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nIt is now in a difficult position. It is haemorrhaging cash, and lost $617m (\u00a3494m) in the first three months of the year.\n\nBoeing has agreed to provide financial support, and is in talks to buy back its former subsidiary.\n\nSources within the aerospace giant insist that efforts are under way to address quality concerns at Spirit, and these have succeeded in reducing the number of faults in parts leaving the Wichita factory by around 80%.\n\nMr Paredes said both companies were aware of the scale of the problem with defects, and that it was discussed at weekly meetings between quality inspectors from both firms.\n\nMatters came to a head for Mr Paredes personally, he claimed, when he was ordered by his manager to change the way in which defects were reported, in order to reduce their overall number.\n\nAfter he protested, he said, he was demoted and removed to another part of the factory.\n\n\"I felt I was being threatened, and I felt I was being retaliated against for raising concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Paredes subsequently filed an \"ethics complaint\" with the company's human resources department, and wrote to Spirit's then chief executive, Tom Gentile.\n\nIn that email, he said \"I have lost faith on the quality organisation here at Spirit and this is my last cry for help\".\n\nMr Paredes was subsequently reinstated in his leadership role and given back-pay after his complaint was partially upheld. He left the company soon afterwards.\n\nHe now maintains he would be reluctant to fly on a 737 Max, in case it still carried flaws that originated in the Wichita factory.\n\n\"I'd never met a lot of people who were scared of flying until I worked at Spirit,\" he said.\n\nAnd then, being at Spirit, I met a lot of people who were afraid of flying - because they saw how they were building the fuselages.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The company suffered a $528 million loss in its most recent quarter on $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\n\"Events in the first quarter of 2024 have resulted in significant reductions in projected revenue and cash flows this year,\" the company said in a statement accompanying its earnings numbers. Ironically, the revenue number was 19% higher than it was the same time last year. Spirit shares were flat in Wednesday trading.\n\nOn the Spirit earnings call, CEO Ryan Avey (who was put in charge just a couple months before the January blowout) said that the firm was doing everything it could to get out from under Boeing's mess, but that it would continue to be difficult for a little while. Like Boeing, it has been dealing with an influx of new scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration while it tries to improve quality control and safety processes.\n\n\"This is a reality of our industry where we have these kinds of disruptions, and we'll roll up our sleeves and figure out a way,\" he said.\n\nSpirit, which used to be a division of Boeing until it was spun out in 2005, has been in negotiations to rejoin its former parent company. Those negotiations continue, Avey said. Outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has stressed the importance of bringing Spirit's operations in-house again, especially in order to cut down on \"traveled work,\" the practice of moving incomplete fuselages along in the production line in order to boost output speed. The 737 Max 9 that suffered the door plug blowout had been traveled. Avey spoke a bit on the earnings call about the logistical complications of what has to be done for a fuselage to be ready for Boeing:\n\nThe details are more complicated than that in the sense that in our production system in Wichita, we conduct 9,000 inspections. When you think about the fuselage that we deliver to Boeing, it's 100 feet long at about 12 feet in diameter. It's the largest single integrated commercial aero structure in the world and we have very exacting tolerances in which we have to build that too from an engineering standpoint. So when we talk about skin quality, skin quality must within 10 thousandths of an inch, or roughly the thickness of 2 sheets of paper. So, when we think about that fuselage, it's about size of a high school basketball court. And when Boeing says 'we expect perfection,' they're talking about nothing in excess of two sheets of paper thickness...So there are no fasteners that can have a tolerance greater than what you could detect with your fingernail.\n\nWhat we've done here is to consolidate all of these inspections where there's a final inspection in Wichita before it goes to Boeing. And when Dave Calhoun talks about clean fuselages, the definition there is what we ship to them, they can load into their first position and immediately put floors down and blankets in.

Spirit supplies Boeing with the fuselages for its 737 Max aircraft and both manufacturers are undergoing an audit by America's aviation safety regulator.\n\nThe talks have become complicated, however, as Spirit seeks to offload the work it does for Boeing's European rival Airbus, notably at Belfast but also at a site in Scotland and in the US.\n\nGuillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive, said last month the company was in early-stage talks with Spirit about the work it does for the plane maker.\n\n\"We would not want our important work packages to be procured from our main and almost sole competitor,\" said Faury.\n\nSpirit's Belfast operations -- which span six sites -- build the wings and mid-fuselage sessions for the Airbus A220 aircraft programme. But they also manufacture fuselage sections and other critical components for a range of business jets built by Canada's Bombardier.\n\nThe operations, which employ more than 3,000 people, are integral to the region's thriving aerospace industry. The Belfast facilities, which are part of the historic Short Brothers factory, also do maintenance and repair work for other aviation customers.\n\nTalks between Spirit and Airbus are progressing in the right direction, according to people familiar with the situation. Analysts have said the European group will be focused on ringfencing the work for the A220 at Belfast and securing the associated jobs.\n\nHowever, in his letter, Ryan stated that while the separation of physical buildings was possible, the company's structure and ecosystem is \"integrally linked\" and gave it \"economies of scale, providing technological synergies, skills and flexibility\".\n\nHe warned that Northern Ireland's ability to compete in a global environment would be put at risk if the operations were dismantled for the \"optimisation of particular customers or other buyers\". By comparison, taking on the entire operation would be a \"much less risky and complex exercise, particularly for an experienced and proficient strategic owner\".\n\nUnion representatives echoed his concerns. Alan Perry, a senior organiser at the GMB Union, said the \"main concern for GMB is that the Belfast sites remain as a single entity and they don't get broken up\".\n\n\"Given the history of the site and the fact they employ nearly 3,000 employees any sale could have huge implications on the local economy.\"\n\nSpirit in Belfast declined to comment on the letter but said: \"As commercial negotiations continue many options remain possible.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Northern Ireland's economy ministry said: \"The potential acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems is a commercial discussion between two companies. The economy minister is being kept informed of the ongoing discussions. It would not be appropriate to comment as these discussions continue.\"\n\nAirbus said it was \"in early-stage discussions on a variety of options, including acquiring from Spirit AeroSystems some of the activities that they carry out for us\".\n\nBombardier said it would \"not comment on Spirit's activities\" but added \"we expect our supply contracts to be maintained to the highest standards of quality and performance in any outcome\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Both programs promise whistleblowers whose tips result in successful enforcement (i.e. big chunky fines) would get between 10% and 30% of the penalty.\n\nWhistleblower reports to the SEC experienced an upward surge after the pandemic, and although there was a fairly stable level of tips between 2021 and 2022, last year saw another big leap:\n\nBoeing, Boeing: The most high-profile tipsters haven't been dishing the dirt on Wall Street. Most recently, Boeing and its faults have attracted the most attention, and a new whistleblower went public on Wednesday. Santiago Paredes, who worked for Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems until mid-2022 inspecting Boeing 737 fuselages, told CBS News that managers pressured him to minimize reports of any defects. \"I almost grew a fear of flying,\" Paredes said, adding \"Knowing what I know about the 737, it makes me very uncomfortable when I fly on one of them.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailyupside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Upside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isobel_asher_hamilton@thedailyupside.com", "name": "Isobel Asher Hamilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_goodman@thedailyupside.com", "name": "Michael Goodman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd\u2013Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.thedailyupside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/whistleblowers_05-10-24_connor-lin.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

This downturn is attributed to Boeing (NYSE:NYSE: BA ), Spirit's major customer, halting acceptance of traveled work and scaling down production due to quality concerns. Consequently, Spirit AeroSystems has opted not to provide financial guidance for the year 2024.\n\nThe company has also revised its production forecasts for Boeing aircraft, with the 737 MAX production expectations now set at 31 per month. Additionally, Spirit AeroSystems has updated its full-year production estimate for the 787 model, now anticipating only 55 deliveries in 2024. This represents a significant decrease from previous expectations.\n\nThe ongoing merger discussions between Spirit AeroSystems and Boeing are highlighted as a critical factor for the stock, especially as the company's financial outlook appears to be substantially weakened. Despite these challenges, RBC Capital's analyst notes the decision to maintain the Sector Perform rating while nudging the price target slightly upward to $35.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_P\u00fablico_de_Radiodifusi\u00f3n_del_Estado_Mexicano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sistema P\u00fablico de Radiodifusi\u00f3n del Estado Mexicano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fundraising", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fundraising", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/f187a581f8c12e0c06939cf5c182b6c5_w_800_h_450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546516", "eventUri": "eng-9546516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 1}

A: CEO Patrick M. Shanahan explained that Spirit will maintain a steady state of 31 aircraft per month for the rest of the year, viewing the ship-in-place as a buffer that allows Boeing to increase production when appropriate. CFO Mark J. Suchinski added that cash deliveries in the second quarter would align with the first quarter as they work through the product process verification, expecting an increase in the third and fourth quarters.\n\nQ: Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies inquired about the assumptions within the A220 and A350 pricing, particularly regarding the forward loss tied to the failure to reach a new pricing agreement with Airbus. A: CFO Mark J. Suchinski clarified that previous assumptions included a higher price based on ongoing discussions, which have not concluded, leading to a reversal of previously booked pricing benefits and additional losses on future performance obligations.\n\nQ: Jason Gursky of Citigroup asked for contextualization on the scale of changes in the aerospace manufacturing ecosystem, particularly regarding the reduction of traveled work. A: CEO Patrick M. Shanahan detailed the extensive changes, including realigning inspection processes and the significant improvements in quality control. He expressed confidence in the substantial progress made and the expected continued improvements.\n\nQ: David Strauss of Barclays sought clarification on the number of MAX units that went through the joint verification process and inquired about the progress in pricing negotiations with Airbus. A: CEO Patrick M. Shanahan responded that by mid-May, they would start processing the first unit from the finished goods buffer and expected to address all advances by the third quarter. He also mentioned ongoing discussions with Airbus about pricing and other economic aspects.\n\nQ: Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets asked about the incremental investments required for the A220 line to support the rates discussed by Airbus. A: CFO Mark J. Suchinski explained the need for significant capital investments in the Belfast facility, including autoclaves and other equipment, to meet the production demands.\n\nQ: Myles Walton of Wolfe Research queried CEO Patrick M. Shanahan about his interest in the potential Boeing CEO position. A: CEO Patrick M. Shanahan affirmed his focus on Spirit AeroSystems and its stakeholders, indicating no interest in the Boeing CEO position.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

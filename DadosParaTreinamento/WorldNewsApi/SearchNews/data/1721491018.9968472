Tip-off on Causeway Street is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Despite suffering a lopsided loss to the Mavericks in Game 4 on Friday, the Celtics still hold a commanding 3-1 series edge in the NBA Finals and will look to close out Dallas in Game 5 at TD Garden. NBA teams are 0-156 in playoff rounds when losing the first three games of a series, with the Mavericks still staring at a steep uphill climb. Boston will need to right the ship with its shooting (36.9 percent in Game 4) and rebounding (13-4 edge in offensive boards for Dallas in Game 4) if it plans on snuffing out the Mavericks for good in Game 5. The Celtics are set to receive a sizable boost in their frontcourt, as Kristaps Porzingis is expected to play in Game 5 after missing the previous two games with a \u201crare\u201d ankle injury.

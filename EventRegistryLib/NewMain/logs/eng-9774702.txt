Yee settled into second, comfortably holding off France's Leo Bergere behind him, but he had a final surprise in store as he surged to a second Olympic gold having also topped the podium as part of the mixed relay in Tokyo.\n\nWant more from MyLondon?

finds stunning finish to overhaul Hayden Wilde and claim triathlon gold", "body": "Tokyo silver medallist Yee trailed by 14 seconds going into the final lap of the 10k run but surged past the Kiwi in the final stages.\n\nAlex Yee produced a stunning finish to emulate Alistair Brownlee as Britain's second Olympic triathlon champion.\n\nThe 26-year-old Londoner went into the delayed race as the favourite but looked to have been beaten into silver by his big rival Hayden Wilde from New Zealand, who had a 14-second lead going into the final lap of the 10 kilometre run.\n\nBut Yee, who claimed silver in Tokyo, had kept enough in his legs and surged past Wilde in the final stages to cross the finish line first on the Pont Alexandre III.\n\nThe men's race had been due to take place on Tuesday but was cancelled at only a few hours' notice after water quality in the Seine was still deemed not up to scratch.\n\nIt was not confirmed that the races would be able to go ahead on Wednesday under the early hours, with the men pushed back to after the women's race.\n\nOrganisers said samples taken showed \"much lower\" levels of bacteria than the threshold for the event to take place, with the hope now that the future events in the river, the triathlon mixed relay and marathon swimming, will not face such uncertainty.\n\nHaving seen his compatriot Beth Potter take bronze, Yee dived into the Seine and managed to keep in touch with the leaders, heading through the first transition in 16th place and quickly joining a big front group for the 40 kilometre bike leg around the centre of Paris.\n\nWilde was in the second pack so Yee tried to help drive the pace rather than sit in, but the two groups came together with three laps to go.\n\nSam Dickinson, making his Olympic debut for Britain, led the way onto the 10km run, with Yee well placed in fourth, and the Tokyo silver medallist soon surged into the lead as his team-mate called for crowd support.\n\nYee is a former British champion over 10,000m, and he sped off into the distance but Wilde refused to let him get away and put in a big effort to catch up.\n\nThe New Zealander was not content to sit with Yee, though, and quickly passed him, with the British athlete seemingly unable to respond as temperatures rose into the high 20s.\n\nYee settled into second, comfortably holding off France's Leo Bergere behind him, but he had a final surprise in store as he surged to a second Olympic gold having also topped the podium as part of the mixed relay in Tokyo.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType":

Back then he was non-committal. But three years later on the streets of Paris, he finally gave his answer. And it was extraordinary.\n\nOn a broiling hot day, it looked like Hayden Wilde of New Zealand was about to win a gold going into the last kilometre. But suddenly and without warning, Wilde seemed to blow up. And Yee, who is such an outstanding runner that he was faster than Mo Farah as a teenager, somehow found an extra gear. The Briton won an astonishing gold medal in 1hr 43min 33sec, with Wilde taking silver and L\u00e9o Bergere finishing third for France.\n\nAs they stood on the pontoon before the start, Yee and Wilde shook hands. But their races soon took divergent paths, with the Briton coming out of the water 28 seconds back in 15th and Wilde a further 36 seconds back.\n\nSoon, though, they were all together in a lead group of 32 on the bike, much to the frustration of Yee, who pushed the race on with the help of his teammate Sam Dickenson.\n\nIt all looked to be going to plan as Yee took the lead at the start of the run. But Wilde, who had been 50 metres back, not only caught his rival but pushed past him. Going into the last 2.5km, Wilde was leading by 14 seconds.\n\nBut Yee - the fastest runner in the field, having represented Britain over 10,000m at the European Athletics Championships - had enough left to deliver a dramatic late twist.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_ingle@theguardian.com", "name": "Sean Ingle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Yee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Yee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Wilde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hayden Wilde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9o_Berg\u00e8re", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9o Berg\u00e8re"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Farah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mo Farah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "10,000 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e3f2d813d870133b2816cc2dba1806983dff50/192_750_5013_3007/master/5013.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ed5587c4e8db8fc8087a7f3c92f3ca64", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774702", "eventUri": "eng-9774702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

For Yee, that elevation will be far beyond any runner's high. For Wilde, this will be the most agonising of silvers.\n\nThe 26-year-old knew the 300m swim through the murky waters of the Seine would be unpleasant yet far from decisive. He predicted the strong cyclists would attempt to separate themselves but a flat course would preclude that possibility.\n\nWilde believed this wouldn't be a triathlon as much as a 10km sprint through the streets of Paris. The favourite: Yee, whose run had become almost unbeatable. The challenger: Wilde, having grown steadily stronger since winning bronze three years ago.\n\nA year later, at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, when they had seemed set to sprint for gold, Wilde was denied by a contentious penalty.\n\nNot today. On almost certainly the the most picturesque triathlon in history, running through the heart of the French capital, he was denied by a better athlete.\n\nThe lead group featured 32 at the second transition, all that came before almost irrelevant, expect for the internal toll it had taken on the athletes.\n\nFor Wilde, that had the potential to be influential. He had left the water 29 seconds off the lead, by far his weakest leg, while Yee was nicely positioned in a lead group of 19.\n\nThe gap remained around that margin until halfway through the 40-kilometre cycle, riding down the Avenue Winston Churchill, passing the Grand Palais, heading along the Champs-Elysees.\n\nWilde's chase group connected and history was in sight. Every medal contender was in a group of 32 at the second transition. That did not last long.\n\nYee was immediately off the front, fellow Brit Sam Dickinson almost celebrating the sight, urging the crowd to infuse his compatriot with additional energy. As it turned out, Yee needed it.\n\nAfter an that early salvo, Wilde closed the gap before the first lap had been completed. Three to run, the rest of the field an afterthought; this race was unfolding how he wanted.\n\nWilde had insisted he now knew how to crack Yee. Standard self-assurance from an elite sportsperson or a quiet truth that would soon be shouted to the world?\n\nFor so long, it looked like the latter. Wilde made his move early in the second lap, creating a bit of breathing room, and for once, the previously unstoppable Yee couldn't respond.\n\nTwo seconds quickly turned into five, five turned to 10. Yee appeared to be labouring. Wilde looked like he had barely begun.\n\nWith five kilometres to run, Wilde was 15 seconds ahead and 15 minutes from Olympic glory.\n\nAll that altitude training at his base in Andorra was paying off. All those miles on the track, all those sacrifices made. It was all for this.\n\nOne lap left, the bell rang, the lead still 14 seconds and Wilde more metronomic than ever.\n\nThoughts must have turned to the Pont Alexandre III, the most ornate bridge in the French capital, connecting the Champs-Elysees quarter with the Eiffel Tower.\n\nHistory was surely his, following Hamish Carter as the only Kiwi to claim triathlon gold.\n\nAnd then it wasn't. Yee not only caught Wilde but ran right by him, turning on to the bridge and celebrating the hardest-fought win of his life.\n\nCollapsing over the line, Wilde joined six seconds later, still finding time to congratulate his friend.

Yee, alongside Alistair's brother Jonny, Jessica Learmonth and Georgia Taylor-Brown, won gold in the sport's first mixed team relay event in Tokyo.\n\nFrance's Leo Bergere made it a multi-event medal double for the hosts, after compatriot Cassandre Beaugrand had earlier taken gold in the women's event, following Wilde home for bronze.\n\nThe buildup to Wednesday's race had been the story of the early part of these Paris Games with the planned familiarisation training swims cancelled not once but twice before the main event, scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed by a day.\n\nTests performed in the early hours of Wednesday morning finally gave the green light meaning there was plenty of anticipation as the male athletes finally descended into the water at 10.45am local time on Wednesday, following shortly after Beaugrand had brought home a fairy tale home gold.\n\nThe Seine swim leg presents a brutal challenge even before the water conditions are taken into account with the whirling currents adding an extra layer of fatigue to what is already one of the most physical of Olympic tests.\n\nItaly's Alessio Crociani was first out after navigating the energy-sapping 1.5km section the best of the field before embarking on the six-lap, 40km bike.\n\nA picturesque course that took in some of the famous of the city's landmarks including the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees saw a 19-man group swell to a mass of 32 into the second transition with Germany's Jonas Schomburg the first to emerge before Yee made his first kick for home.\n\nHe was soon joined by great rival Wilde, who had closed the gap alongside 2021 champion Kristian Blummenfelt on the bike from the chasing pack, with the battle for gold soon becoming a two-man race for the top step of the podium.\n\nWilde appeared to have other ideas and surged clear with a decisive push on the second lap of the 10km run. Yee had no initial answer falling as far as 15 seconds behind as the Kiwi kicked on for gold.\n\nBut in one of the most dramatic finishes of these Games so far, Yee roared back, passing Wilde on the entry to the Pont Alexandre III with only metres remaining before slowing to an almost walk to take the tape and Olympic glory.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

Lewisham-born athlete will be looking to pick up the mantle from the Brownlee brothers to keep the good times rolling for Team GB.\n\nParis 2024 will be the first Olympics without a Brownlee since Athens 2004 after Alistair's retirement and Jonny's narrow failure to earn selection.\n\nThe rising star is facing a daunting task ahead of him but his success at Tokyo 2020 leaves plenty of promise.\n\nSunSport take you through everything you need to know about Alex Yee:\n\nAlex Yee was born on February 18, 1998, and grew up in Lewisham, London.\n\nIn 2017, at just 19 years old and a week before resitting his A-levels, Yee competed in his first World Cup race in Cagliari, Italy.\n\nIn a high-speed race the triathlete came off his bike and collided with a concrete bollard and suffered broken ribs, vertebrae as well as a collapsed lung.\n\nThe star athlete refused to let the accident deter him as he recovered and continued to push for Olympic success.\n\nIn 2019, he featured in the gold medal-winning relay team in the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships in Nottingham along with Georgia Taylor-Brown, Ben Dijkstra, and Sophie Coldwell.\n\nAlex Yee has already enjoyed success at the Olympics despite his young age.\n\nYee won a sensational gold medal in the first-ever Olympic triathlon mixed relay at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe Team GB star went on to pick up the silver medal in the individual event.\n\nAlex Yee will be representing Team GB alongside Beth Potter, Georgia Taylor-Brown, Sam Dickinson and Kate Waugh in the triathlon.\n\nYee said ahead of the Olympics: \"It's such an iconic venue that we're racing at and we're so lucky to be able to swim in the Seine and ride up the Champs-Elysees, which I've grown up dreaming about racing.\n\n\"To actually be able to do it is really special.\n\n\"We always seem to find a new level when it comes to racing as a team.\n\n\"It's special to be able to race with your teammates because even though people think it's a very individual sport, we train and work so hard together, so it's nice to be able to share that experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Get after it with local recommendations just for you. Discover nearby events, routes out your door, and hidden gems when you sign up for the Local Running Drop.\n\nIf you want to know how to turn silver into gold, then look no further than Great Britain's Alex Yee. In another epic duel with New Zealand's Hayden Wilde - a rivalry that has become a hallmark of the modern short-course racing - the flying Brit, as has so often happened, had the edge. But this time, at the Paris Olympic men's triathlon race, he was really made to work for it, closing down 14 seconds in the final run lap to finally take the tape ahead of silver medalist Wilde.\n\nIf the two standout favorites delivered, it was also an outstanding day for the home nation, as Leo Bergere picked up bronze following Beaugrand's victory earlier in the morning.\n\nBergere was pushed all the way by team-mate Pierre Le Corre, who finished fourth, but defending Olympic champion Kristian Blummenfelt's ambitious return from long-course racing ultimately didn;t pay off as he came in 12th place.\n\nIt wasn't the day Team USA's main contender, Morgan Pearson, had hoped for. The Boulder-based 30-year-old will have to refocus his energies on the mixed team relay after being caught on the wrong side of a bike split early on. Pearson finished in 30th, two places behind fellow American Seth Rider.\n\nFor the best part of three years, the male elite triathletes of the Paris Olympic Games had been preparing for an 8 a.m. start in cool conditions. After the endless concerns over heat and humidity at the Rio and Tokyo Games, many were welcoming the idea of not having to hear the dreaded words Wet Bulb Globe (the measurement of whether it's safe to compete) until at least we hit L.A. in 2028.\n\nBut only hours before the men's individual triathlon race in Paris, that all changed. After subpar water quality tests forced the men's race from 8 a.m. on Tuesday to 10:45 a.m. Wednesday (following the women's race that same day), athletes learned their race would finish in the sweltering 80-degree F heat and 79% humidity. What was set to be the sternest of tests got even tougher.\n\nJust as with the women's race less than three hours earlier (and aided by being a non-wetsuit contest) the men's swim was quick to split up. Also as in the women's race, a number of athletes were issued a 15-second penalty for errors at the start: Shachar Sagiv (ISR), Richard Murray (NED), Antonio Serrat Seoane (ESP), Manoel Messias (BRA), Emil Holm (DEN), and Csongor Lehmann (HUN).\n\n2016 Rio bronze medallist Henri Schoeman (RSA) quickly cut across from the far right of the pontoon to gain the best of the current, but it was Australia's Matt Hauser who snuck up the inside on the first lap to lead after the Aussie exit at the 950-meter mark.\n\nThe three French contenders - Dorian Coninx, Pierre Le Corre, and Leo Bergere - were surely riding on the wave of teammate Cassandre Beaugrand's success. With their race kicking off minutes after Beaugrand's home-soil win in the women's race, all three were handily placed in the top 10 after the first lap, along with Britain's medal favorite Alex Yee.\n\nAfter the shorter second lap of 550 meters, Italy's Alessio Crociani was first to exit the water in 20:10 and led the field up the steps and into transition, joined by Hauser and Schoeman. Eight seconds down were Coninx and Le Corre. Seth Rider was the best-placed of the two U.S. hopes in eighth, with Morgan Pearson, who tasted his first World Series victory in Yokohama in May, in 34th place, 1:20 down from Crociani.\n\nOnly 29 seconds separated first place and 19th out of the swim as the race - and the conditions - heated up.\n\nAny comparisons to the women's race ended at T1, as the course conditions could hardly have contrasted more than with the start of the wet and slick women's race. As the race heated up, any remaining moisture on the flat, technical bike course evaporated quickly, along with the hopes of Pearson - who already found himself 90 seconds down starting the bike and then found himself in a five-man third chase pack, with too much firepower ahead.\n\nUp front, the French trio of Bergere, Le Corre and Coninx - so strong that they kept two-time world champion Vincent Luis on the sidelines when the French team was selected - were conscious of the dual threat of Yee and Hayden Wilde (NZL) on the final 10km run leg.\n\nBut as they made their way through the bike course, they realized they'd have to shake more than just Yee and Wilde before T2. On their rear wheel, a 19-strong leading group had formed, with the likes of Rider, Hauser, and Marten Van Riel (BEL) looking to make a big move.\n\nOnly 26 seconds behind on lap two was a formidable chase pack containing Wilde, Tokyo Olympic champion Kristian Blummenfelt (NOR) and Portugal's Vasco Vilaca. As they pushed the pace, it was clear things were coming down quickly for the Frenchmen at the front.\n\nBy the end of the fourth lap, the catch had been made, and the front group swelled to 30, including most of the pre-race favorites and the entire podium from the Tokyo Games.\n\nHaving won almost everything there is to win in triathlon, Blummenfelt has confirmed he will turn his attention to pro cycling next year, and the center of Paris presented the perfect opportunity to put on a showcase. In the absence of teammate and training partner Gustav Iden, who did not qualify for the Paris Games, Blummenfelt pulled fellow Norwegian Vetle Thorn to the front of the race for company in the bike group, with Thorn in the best shape of his career after a fourth place in WTCS Cagliari in May.\n\nWith a bigger group and little to be gained by a breakaway so close to the second transition, there was little separation in the now 32-strong lead pack. If anyone did try and make a move, Great Britain's Sam Dickinson, who was tasked with working for teammate Yee, quickly moved to shut it down.\n\nDickinson, Blummenfelt and Thorn crossed the bike dismount timing mat at the exact same time, with 9 more (including Bergere, Wilde, and Rider) crossing in the next second and a total of 32 athletes (including Yee, Coninx, and Vilaca) crossing within a 9- second timeframe. More than three minutes down were Pearson, Holm, and Sachar; a third pack entered T2 more than five minutes behind the leaders.\n\nHeading into T2, Dickinson was determined to make the most of his moment in the sunshine, and transitioned quickly to lead out onto the run. But the real action was behind, and once the identical trisuit of Yee flew by, it was game on.\n\nThe 2023 Paris test event had witnessed Yee float imperiously to victory, and this looked like set for a little history repeating. Within the first two kilometers, he had opened a gap on the field before. But history did indeed repeat itself when almost instinctively, Wilde appeared at his shoulder. The two often find each other in the run at World Triathlon Championship Series events, racing neck-and-neck in an ongoing battle of mind and body.\n\nBut while the duo have so often run side-by-side until Yee pulled clear at the last possible moment, this time it was Wilde who took the initiative, regualrly glancing down at his watch as he strode away.\n\nBy the halfway mark, Wilde was clear, but Yee looked in trouble, and the trio of Bergere, Le Corre and Canadian Tyler MIslawchuk were closing. But Yee, refusing to yield, entered the final lap set on closing the 14-second gap Wilde had opened up. But would it prove to be too much to claw back in such a short timeframe?\n\nThe answer: Of course not. Yee dug deep and surged ahead of Wilde in the final stretch, finishing in 1:43:33 to win his first gold medal in the men's individual triathlon, adding to his silver medal in individual triathlon and gold in mixed relay from the Tokyo Games.\n\nWilde followed six seconds behind to take silver, collapsing at the finish with his friend and rival. Bergere finished ten seconds behind, taking bronze in front of a roaring home crowd.", "source": {"uri": "triathlete.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Triathlete"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He was so fatigued as he crossed the line that he could not even raise his arms in triumph.\n\nWith Alistair Brownlee watching at the side of the finish, Yee's gold means that Great Britain have now won three of the last four men's Olympic triathlon titles and also taken a further two silvers and a bronze.\n\nA big moment for home favourite Leo Bergere, too, who claimed bronze.\n\nHis team-mate Pierre le Corre just missed out on a medal in fourth, just as his compatriot Emma Lombardi did in the women's earlier today. It's hard when someone in the team takes a medal and the other doesn't but that is sport, I guess.\n\nHe played a crucial role in the cycle leg but ensuring nobody broke clear of that enormous lead pack. He led into the run before falling back. He speaks about Yee's win:\n\nFive golds to four currently.\n\nHe can be proud of himself, ran a superb race but just came up short against Yee. He looks reasonably happy with silver, in any case as he sits down to congratulate Yee. Not to be scoffed at.\n\nAll three medallists in one shot. Yee-Wilde-Bergere.\n\nHe kept in touch with Wilde for so long but it was probably into the final 700m or so that Wilde started to struggle and Yee pounced with perhaps 100m of the race remaining, perhaps even less.\n\nWilde hangs on to win silver and Leo Bergere of France takes a bronze to go with the gold Beaugrand took in the women's event earlier today.\n\nYes he is! Yee is going to take the lead into the final stages...\n\nHe takes the lead! Wilde has blown up... Yee is going to take Olympic gold!\n\nDevastation for Wilde who led for so long but jubiliation for Great Britain's Alex Yee!\n\nThough he does look over his shoulder. Nervously? I don't think so. Approximately 1.5km to go. Yee is in fact being caught by Leo Bergere, I think.\n\nHayden Wilde of New Zealand leads the way in the closing stages. Team GB's Alex Yee is in the silver medal spot with the French pair of Leo Bergere and Pierre le Corre fighting for third, though the latter has slipped back in his fight for bronze.\n\nOne lap of the run circuit remaining. What's the gap?\n\n14 seconds, so it has grown slightly. It's a big ask to reel this in but it all depends on how Wilde is feeling, but his form seems to be strong so far.\n\nSo it's roughly staying the same. It certainly has not increased or decreased in any meaningful way.\n\nIt's 12 seconds now to leader Wilde and Yee has gained a couple of seconds on the French pair chasing.\n\nWe are at the half-way mark of the run. What's the gap going to be now? Maybe over 10, 15 maybe?\n\nYes, it is 15 seconds... Yee is seven seconds clear of the French duo.\n\nHe has gone too early or is this going to win him Olympic gold? Plenty of time to go, obviously but he looks fairly comfortable.\n\nProbably a few seconds in it, maybe as much as five. Is it increasing? I think it is...\n\nWilde and Yee out front with the two Frenchmen, Leo Bergere and Pierre le Corre 13 seconds behind in third and fourth.\n\nHayden Wilde of New Zealand is behind him. They are quite a way out front, possibly as much as 10 or 15 seconds.\n\nCycling ends, running begins. Someone in that group dropped their bike. Dickonson leads the way as they enter the run with Yee in fourth and now third... with Germany's Schomburg in second.\n\nDickinson appears to have done his job, to allow Team GB team-mate Alex Yee to be right in medal contention. Dickonson then drops off to the side of the road and will rejoin the race at a much slower pace.\n\nAlex Yee in that lead group too.\n\nNothing really significant has happened yet... until now when a group of two have opened a slight gap. Those two riders are Team GB's Sam Dickinson and Kristian Blummenfelt of Norway, but it does not appear to a genuine move. It is certainly not a long-lasting one.\n\nIt's all coming down to the run, I think. Unless something big happens in the last lap of the cycling.\n\nAlex Yee and Sam Dickinson. Anyone in the chasing pack is surely out of contention with an enormous gap. So it will be one of these 32 men who will win, surely.\n\nThe chasers will make it into a lead pack of 32. Alex Yee is in that group.\n\nDylan McCullough of New Zealand has dropped out.\n\nBut there is a 24-second gap between them and the chasing group.\n\nIt is three Frenchman at the front at the moment with Yee in the middle somewhere. Conditions are dry apart from the odd puddle here and there so we should see significant fewer crashes than in the women's race earlier this morning.\n\nWe are well into the cycling leg. Team GB's Alex Yee is not in that group. It is made up of Crociani (Italy), Hauser (Australia), Schoeman (South Africa), Le Corre (France), Coninx (France) and Gonzalez Garcia (Spain).\n\nAnd the cycling has begun:\n\nCrociani of Italy leads the way followed by South Africa's Schoeman and Australia's Hauser one and four seconds behind respectively.\n\nAlex Yee is in 18th, 27 seconds behind leader Crociani. A long way to go yet, though.\n\nAround 13 seconds from the lead.\n\nBoats and various other water-borne objects are getting close to being grazed by the athletes as they finish their first lap. A little less disturbance from the current closer to the banks and any other boats etc.\n\nAt this stage... a few competitors running into the buoy at the turn, though.\n\nThe men's Olympic triathlon is under way.\n\nTeam GB's Alex Yee is the favourite for that, as Potter was for the women's. Let's see if he can convert that into a medal of some description. Yee was winner of the world championship just under a year ago in Paris...\n\nShe slumps to the ground after crossing the finish line. In fairness, so did the gold medal winner. Not an easy event, obviously.\n\nSome 1min40sec adrift of the lead, but it was a year hampered by injury.\n\nShe wins gold in front of her home crowd. Not just french, she is a Parisian. She bossed the final lap and never looked back once she made the move.\n\nDerron takes silver and Beth Potter wins bronze.\n\nLombardi, the other home athlete in the lead group, sadly misses out on a medal.\n\nI think she might struggle to get a medal... but she's not giving up.\n\nBeaugrand leads comfortably with around 1km to go. Potter still in the bronze medal position.\n\nIs this the moment that wins the race as the crowd roars her towards victory? She has opened up a decent gap on Derron and Potter. Lombardi, the other French woman in the top four, is in fourth...\n\nPotter is starting to look a bit laboured now.\n\nDerron from Switzerland leads the way and kicks on a little - she has been in the lead most of the run - as they start the third lap of the run. Beaugrand and Lombardi from France are in there as is Beth Potter.\n\nWho is going to take gold and who will mess out on a medal? Still a distance to go and it all looks a bit cagey. Potter is well positioned and went into this event as the favourite. She's a very strong runner.\n\nThe lead group lapping some of the backmarkers.\n\nGeorgia Taylor-Brown has dropped off now, with Duffy in fifth alone so medal hopes look slim save for some blow-ups ahead.\n\nShe's currently in fifth and is trying to get into the lead group of five and into medal contention. Not quite sure if she's managing that yet as Derron leads the way.\n\nDerron of Switzerland, Beaugrand and Lombardi of France and Potter of Great Britain.\n\nBermuda's Duffy, the defending champion, and Team GB's Taylor-Brown are nine seconds adrift.\n\nIs now a group of seven in the run. Potter and Taylor-Brown in there, in the reckoning for the medals. In fact, that group has broken slightly into four, two and then a one. It's possible that Taylor-Brown has dropped back slightly since they started the run.\n\nTaylor Spivey is in a group of one in eighth, I believe.\n\nLooks like Germany's Lindemann has essentially dropped back into the chasing group.\n\nIn no woman's land, as it were. Not quite sure how far off the lead group she is, though, after that crash.\n\nThat should dry out the course, but there's not a great deal of time left in the bike leg. Men come later today, though. Kate Waugh is in the chasing group that is about 1min8sec adrift of the lead group, headed by Taylor Knibb.\n\nAgain, not sure what happened. Another innocuous-looking incident. The group of 10 at the front are now down to nine women.\n\nAgain, Potter and Taylor-Brown in the same group of 10. Also in the group: Kuttor-Bragmayer of Hungary, Lindemann of Germany and Lombardi and Beaugrand of France.\n\nThe chasing group cross the line to start their lap five 1min6sec behind, which has come down a little since the last lap.\n\n...and out. She had a crash earlier but this time is not getting up. Not sure why she crashed, it was on a straight. Someone else must have clipped her, or she clipped someone else. Slightly concerning as she is failing to get up and is being seen to by some of the gendarmerie. Or are they regular police? Can't really tell.\n\nBut in reality it's a group of about 10 who are taking turns on the front. It includes Britons Potter and Taylor-Brown.\n\nBut basically in the same back as Potter, Derron, Taylor-Brown and Duffy et al.\n\nShe is on the side of the road, sitting down and in tears. A medal contender from Luxembourg but that dream is now over.\n\nOnto lap two on the bikes and Potter is leading the way, with Flora Duffy having been deposed from the head of the race.\n\nThe reputation of triathletes is that they are not the best bike handlers and these tricky conditions are backing that up, I am afraid. Some of them have been pretty inoccuous, in fairness.\n\nLopes of Brazil goes over. She locked up her rear brake three times and then the back end finally slid out too far and over she goes. Not sure if she applied the brake to stop the slide or the brake caused the slide. Strange as there is another crash on a very damp course.\n\nDuffy still leads the way...\n\nDuffy leads by 18 seconds and Beth Potter is in the chasing pack in fifth, 18 seconds adrift. Georgia-Taylor Brown also in that same group.\n\nIt's a hefty one at a tricky corner and her chain has come off too... I think it's Manami Iijima from Guam.\n\nIt's a damp course with cobbles in many places. Miller from Norway is also down so it may have been a collision.\n\nCompleted the swim leg in 10th, some 36 seconds down on leader and defending Olympic champion Duffy.\n\nThe competitors then go up the steps off the bank of the Seine and into the transition onto two wheels. Potter is in fifth, 20 seconds adrift of the leader.\n\nDuffy leads the way followed by Seregni of Italy, Lopes of Brazil. Beth Potter in fourth around 16 seconds back from leader Duffer. Team GB's Georgia Taylor-Brown is in 11th. Kate Waugh, also of Team GB, is in 42nd and 90 seconds adrift.\n\nIs Bermuda's Flory Duffy who has taken the long way around, nearly swimming into some boats. She has added an extra few metres, at least, onto her route but still leads the way by a few metres.\n\nA bright and early start as they dive into the Seine. It'll be two laps of the swim course totalling 1.5km followed by 40km on the bikes and then a 10k run to finish things off.\n\nThe Olympic women's and men's triathlon races will take place on a rainy Wednesday morning in Paris after the River Seine was declared clean enough for the swimming leg to take place. Athletes were informed at 3am UK time that readings of E.coli had fallen below the World Triathlon safe limit of 900 colony-forming units per millilitre after several days of hot sun following the downpour during the Open Ceremony.\n\nThe readings, which were between 980 and 1,553 on Tuesday morning, had caused organisers to postpone the scheduled men's race but both events will now take place on Wednesday. They will now begin with the women's race at 7am UK time and be followed by the men at 9.45am. The conditions, however, are still far from perfect. There is currently heavy rain in Paris, meaning the levels of pollution are again expected to rise in the coming hours, and the city centre streets, which will stage the 40km cycle over seven laps passing many major landmarks, will be slippy.\n\nTeam GB, for whom Alex Yee and Beth Potter are respective favourites for the men's and women's races have said that they will be ready whatever happens today. Georgia Taylor-Brown, who won individual silver and team gold in Tokyo, is also a medal contender for Team GB alongside Kate Waugh in the women's race. Sam Dickinson is expected to take up more of a support role after being selected in the men's team ahead of Jonny Brownlee, the three time Olympic medallist and brother of double Olympic champion Alistair.\n\nThe family of Yee, who won the test event last year, were among the relatives of athletes seeking confirmation on Tuesday that they can still use their tickets if the race goes ahead at the rescheduled time on Wednesday. Fans who were due to attend the men's race cannot use their tickets on Wednesday and will be refunded. \"We are putting in place a policy around the friends and family tickets,\" said Kit McConnell, the sports director at the International Olympic Committee.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

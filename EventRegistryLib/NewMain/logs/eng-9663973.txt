Walang nakadaan dahil nakaharang sa daan... Kailangan nang maiwasan ang ganito para hindi na umabot sa pagkawala ng buhay,\" he said.\n\n(A post recently fell down because of the entangled wires and it caused traffic congestion. No one could pass because the road was blocked...We need to avoid this kind of situation from happening again so that lives will not be lost.)\n\nSeveral localities already have existing ordinances to manage entangled cables such as in San Juan City and Valenzuela City.\n\nThe officials present during the meeting also agreed to the conduct of an information drive before dangling cables are cleared to warn residents of possible service interruptions.\n\nBulacan Representatives Salvador Pleyto Sr. earlier filed a bill that would require public utility providers must bundle up their sagging and dangling aerial utility wires, remove all non-operational or unused wires and cables, and relocate or replace post adhering to the specified allowable clearance of aerial wires and cables.\n\nIn February, Senator Raffy Tulfo filed a resolution seeking a probe of the frequent road accidents due to the mishandling and improper maintenance of live wires and unattended wires. -- Vince Angelo Ferreras/BAP, GMA Integrated News", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Manila_Development_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Manila Development Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro Manila"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMA_Integrated_News_and_Public_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GMA Integrated News and Public Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valenzuela,_Metro_Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valenzuela, Metro Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valenzuela, Metro Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffy_Tulfo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raffy Tulfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulacan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulacan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bulacan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Metro_Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Juan, Metro Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Juan, Metro Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Cable_and_Wire", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Cable and Wire", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Wiring_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Wiring and Accessories", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Electrical", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Electrical", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Cable_Modem", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Cable Modem", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2024/06/LGUs_urged_to_pass_ordinances_versus_spaghetti_wires_2024_06_18_22_59_57.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663973", "eventUri": "eng-9663973", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Zamora said heavy cables installed by telecommunication companies have accumulated over the years, causing the poles of Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) to fall.\n\n\"Most of these wires are useless, no longer functional and can be removed,\" he told a virtual news briefing in Filipino.\n\nLocal governments should coordinate with Meralco and telecommunication companies in removing these cables, he added.\n\nMMDA Resolution No. 24-16, which seeks to prevent accidents and fires, cited an accident in Binondo, Manila last year when a power pole collapsed.\n\nAt the same briefing, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) acting Chairman Romando S. Artes said contractors choose not to remove nonworking wires to avoid disrupting electricity and other services.\n\nThe public should be informed about wire-cleaning initiatives, he added.\n\nQuezon City Administrator Michael Victor \"Mike\" N. Alimurung told the MMC local governments should limit the number of cables per pole.\n\nTelecommunication companies must first get a permit from LGUs before they can install these cables, Mr. Zamora said.\n\nThe MMDA is also studying placing poles underground, which could be expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, the MMDA said it had not started apprehending unconsolidated jeepneys pending guidelines from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).\n\nMr. Artes said stopping jeepneys to check for compliance could worsen traffic jams and inconvenience commuters.\n\nHe added that enforcers do not know what to check to know if a jeepney has consolidated or not.\n\nOfficials of the Department of Transportation and LTFRB have yet to meet about the matter, he added.\n\nLTFRB chief Teofilo E.

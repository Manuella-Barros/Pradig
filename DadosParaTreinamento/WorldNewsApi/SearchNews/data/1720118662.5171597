Adopted at 3 from Lithuania, she had a speech impediment, which led to her being bullied and getting into fights at school. In 7th grade, she said, she started self-harming, and in high school, she skipped classes, did drugs and ran away. \u201cI was a troubled teen,\u201d she said. Her mother\u2019s co-worker had sent her son to a faith-based boarding school in southeast Missouri a couple of years earlier, Kolberg said, and recommended it. So the morning of Nov. 11, 2005, when she was 16 and in her junior year in high school, Kolberg\u2019s parents offered to take her to McDonald\u2019s for her favorite \u2014 a breakfast burrito \u2014 on the way to class. But instead of dropping her off at school afterward, she said, they headed to the highway. \u201cThey said we were going to check out this alternate school,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom kept repeating at least half-a-dozen times, \u2018It has horses,\u2019 because I love animals.\u201d Six-and-a-half hours later, they pulled into a secluded, wooded area in what seemed like the middle of nowhere \u2014 especially for a teen from Chicago. They\u2019d arrived at Lighthouse Christian Academy, an unlicensed boarding school operated by ABM Ministries and run by Larry and Carmen Musgrave. For the next 19 months, this would be her home. Kolberg, however, calls it by another name: \u201cIt was actual hell.\u201d In early March, Larry and Carmen Musgrave were charged with kidnapping, and another staffer faces one count of physical abuse of a student. The Wayne County sheriff said he expects additional charges. Both Musgraves have pleaded not guilty, and their attorney did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Musgraves ran the boarding school under a \u201cchip\u201d system, many former students have told The Star. Students started out on \u201cwhite chip\u201d status, which meant they had all the privileges that were allowed. If they got demoted, they would drop to \u201cblue chip\u201d status, followed by \u201cred chip.\u201d Kolberg said students would get demoted \u201cfor the slightest thing.\u201d \u201cIf you ended up on red chip, you had to sleep on the top bunk in a T-shirt and shorts on nothing but a slab of plywood,\u201d she said. \u201cNo pillow or blanket, either. So you\u2019re freezing throughout the night, and you barely get any sleep.\u201d For showers, those who were on \u201cred chip\u201d status got no hot water. \u201cYou had to get a five-gallon bucket and fill it up with cold water,\u201d Kolberg said. Breakfast for the \u201cwhite and blue chips,\u201d she said, \u201ccould be scrambled eggs, it could be hash browns, sausage and gravy and pancakes. But for the red chips, it was always oatmeal and maybe a banana if there were any left. For lunch, a peanut butter sandwich and an apple and your own water bottle, filled halfway up.\u201d Placed on \u201cblack chip\u201d status Even worse than \u201cred chip\u201d status, Kolberg said, was being put on \u201cblack chip.\u201d \u201cWhen I first got there, you were allowed to talk during some types of activities and during meals,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after about two months, when somebody started talking about their home life, all talking was squashed. They said we weren\u2019t there to make friends.\u201d One day, Kolberg said, she got caught passing notes in school to a girl sitting next to her. They\u2019d been doing it for weeks, hiding the notes in the battery compartment of a calculator. \u201cWe would just talk about food \u2014 I mean, we were like starving there \u2014 and about our families,\u201d she said. \u201cThen it got to the point where we would write derogatory comments about Carmen.\u201d When she got caught passing a note one day, Kolberg said, she swallowed it. And that got her placed on \u201cblack chip\u201d status. For three days, she said, she was pulled out of school and forced to pick up horse \u201capples\u201d \u2014 manure \u2014 with her bare hands, put it in a bucket, carry it 200 yards and dump it in a ditch, from 7 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon. During that time, she said, she also had to mow the expansive grounds with a manual push reel lawn mower in 90-degree heat while wearing overalls and steel-toed work boots. \u201cAnd for two weeks, I was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner nothing but instant mashed potatoes with pieces of paper in it since I supposedly liked to eat paper so much,\u201d she said \u2014 a reference to her swallowing the note after getting caught passing it to another student. \u201cBy the 13th day, I was literally starving. I snapped. I threw down my plate and headed right to the kitchen and said, \u2018I\u2019m done. This is f------ bulls---. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019 \u201cMr. Larry said, \u2018Get over here, and you\u2019d better shut your mouth and sit down.\u2019 I took a swing at him and missed. He was quick. He flipped me around, put me in a chokehold, and I just dropped and blacked out.\u201d When she came to, she said, the students who had been in the dining room were gone. She had a \u201cmassive headache,\u201d she said, and could hear Carmen and Larry saying, \u201cGet up! Get up!\u201d Kolberg said the Musgraves often became impatient with her because of her speech impediment and even made fun of her. \u201cMiss Carmen was the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was so cruel about it. She would say, \u2018You\u2019re faking it. Come on, just spit it out. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d In many ways, Kolberg said, the psychological abuse at ABM was worse than the physical abuse. \u201cMiss Carmen would berate you,\u201d she said. \u201cShe would say, \u2018You\u2019re lucky your parents didn\u2019t send you back (to Lithuania). I would have never adopted you. I would have sent you back.\u2019 She would take your personal life and just attack every inch of it. You felt like s--- all the time.\u201d If someone got out of bed at night to use the restroom, she said, a motion detector would set off a blaring alarm. \u201cIf Carmen was in a bad mood, she\u2019d get everybody up and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure you\u2019re too tired to go to the bathroom.\u2019 Then she\u2019d have us go outside and run laps around the basketball court.\u201d Either that, Kolberg said, or they\u2019d be sent to the dining room, where Carmen would start up a Billy Blanks Tae-Bo high-energy workout video and make them participate. \u201cI was terrified because their rules were so outrageous, and I was just screwing up left and right,\u201d Kolberg said. \u201cFor the first couple of months, I wet the bed. The third time it happened, Carmen said, \u2018I\u2019m going to embarrass you enough that you won\u2019t ever do it again.\u2019 So I had to clean my sheets outside in the courtyard with a bucket of water and a brush while everybody watched.\u201d One girl who was a lesbian, Kolberg said, was treated horribly. \u201cThey called her an abomination and said, \u2018What you\u2019re doing is sinful, and you\u2019re gonna die and burn in hell,\u2019\u201d she said. Split lips and bruises The boys, Kolberg said, \u201chad it more physical than the girls.\u201d \u201cSome boys would have split lips, bruises on them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they were more physical with the kids whose parents never came to visit.\u201d Kolberg said one boy, only 12 years old and one of the smallest students, was constantly on \u201cred chip\u201d status. \u201cThey tortured that kid,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir favorite thing to do to him was fill up a book bag with rocks, put weights on his arms and legs and make him run laps in the courtyard. We would all see him outside, just running. He would fall and be exhausted and crawling. And they\u2019re out there screaming at him, and he\u2019s bawling his eyes out, scraped up and bleeding.\u201d It happened at least once a week, she said. \u201cThey were so mean to him, and it just broke my heart, because you couldn\u2019t say anything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d try to give him a smile to try to show, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d When Kolberg attended ABM, it was located in Patterson, but the Musgraves were building a new school near Piedmont. \u201cWe were the ones who helped build the Piedmont school, from the ground up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys did the labor on the building. The girls had to clear out the trees. And we had to go into the dried-up creek bed and haul rocks to create a driveway.\u201d During a 10-hour day of hard labor, she said, they each got one bottle of water, a sandwich and an apple. Kolberg turned 18 on April 8, 2007, and graduated on June 8. Her parents came to her graduation, then took her home. After that, she said, she spent a year-and-a-half in an abusive marriage, tried to commit suicide and got a divorce. For years, Kolberg said, she pushed the memories of Lighthouse Christian Academy out of her mind. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d she said. \u201cI just blocked it out. I just wanted to focus on my future.\u201d But eventually, she said, she decided that \u201cI am done being sad and tired.\u201d She became a certified nursing assistant and now is a dialysis technician. At 35, she is happily married, lives in a northwest Chicago suburb and sees her parents regularly. She said she doesn\u2019t hold it against her parents for sending her to Lighthouse Christian Academy. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were at their wits\u2019 end.\u201d She does, however, blame the Musgraves for what she said students endured. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I survived this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed lives. They preached the Bible, but they were straight from hell. \u201cI hope they are brought to justice and that they will be held accountable.\u201d", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/missouri-boarding-school-preached-bible-110000891.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/kansas_city_star_mcclatchy_articles_677/419feced13cff9bb26fe8fe8cb34ff29", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:06:01", "author": "Judy L.

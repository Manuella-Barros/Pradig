The move follows months of speculation regarding Trong's weakening health. The party has not disclosed specifics about his treatment.\n\nLam, a former head of internal security, is seen as a top candidate to succeed Trong when his term concludes in 2026. The powerful Politburo has assigned Lam to oversee the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat, according to a statement from the party's central office. In Vietnam's Communist-ruled system, the party chief holds the most influential position, despite the country having no official paramount ruler. Trong, 80, has been in office since 2011.\n\nSince 2017, Trong, a Marxist-Leninist ideologue, has initiated a China-style anti-corruption campaign known as the 'blazing furnace.' However, he has been visibly fragile in recent months and has missed several high-level meetings. In a surprising gesture, the Politburo awarded Trong with the Gold Star medal, Vietnam's highest honor for public officials, on Thursday.\n\nLam was elected president in May following the resignation of several top leaders amid unspecified allegations of wrongdoing, part of Trong's extensive anti-graft campaign. Lam, a central figure in this crackdown, vowed to continue the fight against corruption after his election. Vietnam's main stock market rose by 0.5% following the announcement. A senior Western diplomat based in Hanoi commented on Lam's expanded authority, saying it could be good for stability but noted that its impact on economic, foreign, and domestic policies remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trong_(state_constituency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trong (state constituency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u00f4_L\u00e2m", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T\u00f4 L\u00e2m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Ph\u00fa_Tr\u1ecdng", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_under_Xi_Jinping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Unity Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\u2013Leninism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marxism\u2013Leninism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_55_697089.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

Now attention turns to his successor, former security minister To Lam.\n\nNguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party and the country's most powerful politician, has died following months of ill health, official media said Friday. He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral would be held.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nTrong launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nAs a result, Trong achieved the rare feat of hosting the top leaders of the United States, China, and Russia in less than a year between September 2023 and June 2024. His adroit balancing of the fierce geopolitical rivals was displayed in the outpouring of condolences upon his passing.\n\nThe Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent its condolences to its Vietnamese counterpart and \"deeply mourned\" Trong's death, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday.\n\nThe White House also issued a statement of condolences, with President Joe Biden calling Trong \"a champion of the deep ties between the American and Vietnamese people whose leadership helped nurture the friendship and partnership our countries enjoy today.\"\n\nLikewise, Russia's President Vladimir Putin said Trong had \"earned enormous respect among his fellow country people and a remarkable reputation in the international arena.\" In a telegram sent to Lam, and posted on the Kremlin's website, Putin said, \"In Russia, he [Trong] will always be remembered as a true friend of our country, who made a huge personal contribution to the establishment and development of a comprehensive strategic partnership between Moscow and Hanoi.\"\n\nTrong's legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said.\n\n\"Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms don't really matter as much as personal power,\" Giang said.\n\nVietnamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18, with the official announcement saying Trong was receiving treatment for his ill health. As Vietnam's top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in corruption allegations.\n\nThe party's Politburo asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from its central office, which was the first official confirmation of Trong's poor health.\n\nRumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin.\n\nTrong's death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted \"a very uncertain time\" in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are \"very shaky.\"\n\n\"Now it isn't only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,\" Giang said.\n\nIn early 2026, Vietnam's Communist Party will hold a national congress that will determine who holds the top-most leadership positions for the next five years.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [],

statement said.\n\n- Upheaval -\n\nThe country's communist regime, which is in the midst of a complete overhaul, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a vast anti-corruption campaign.\n\nLam served as Vietnam's public security minister before being voted in as president in May by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after his predecessor was forced to resign.\n\nAnalysts said at the time that Lam, who was deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption matters, had weaponised investigations to take down his political rivals.\n\nIn his first remarks as president, Lam said he was \"determined to fight corruption and negative phenomena\".\n\nBenoit de Treglode, research director at the Institute for Strategic Research at France's military academy in Paris, told AFP Thursday that his designation as interim leader signalled \"the total victory of To Lam\".\n\n\"He is an extremely strong statesman, supported by a ministry at the heart of the Vietnamese political project,\" he said, adding that Lam's interim leadership could last until the party congress in January 2026.\n\n\"We will witness a personalisation of power around him, which will lead to political stability\" and a movement towards \"continuity, and not rupture\", he continued.\n\nHeaded by the party general secretary, Vietnam's leadership structure gives the president the second-most authority, and also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.\n\n- Hard line -\n\nTrong's poor health has fuelled widespread speculation that he will not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.\n\nIn office since 2011, Trong has enjoyed remarkable longevity in his role, which rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.\n\nKnown for being a technocrat and on good terms with Beijing, he had structured the party around himself, benefiting from a decade of economic growth that has strengthened his legitimacy.\n\nLam has long been considered one of the most serious candidates to succeed Trong, and was noted for the hard line he adopted when he was Minister of Public Security.\n\nThree years ago he caused a public outcry after a video was released showing him eating a steak covered in gold leaf at an upmarket London restaurant, shortly after laying a wreath at Karl Marx's grave.\n\nA few months later, the regime jailed a street vendor for posting a parody video that went viral.\n\nThere is little room for dissent against one-party rule in Vietnam, with critical voices subject to intimidation, harassment and travel restrictions.\n\nbur/srg/ah/smw", "source": {"uri":

To Lam on Thursday July 18, 2024 became the caretaker of the Communist Party because of party chief Nguyen Phu Trong's poor health, the party said in a statement.\n\nHANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party and the country's most powerful politician, has died following months of ill health, official media said Friday. He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral would be held.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nTrong's legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said.\n\n\"Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms doesn't really matter as much as personal power,\" Giang said.\n\nVietanamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18 while Trong received treatment for his ill health.

Vietnamese President To Lam on Thursday July 18, 2024 became the caretaker of the Communist Party because of Trong's poor health, the party said in a statement. (Luong Thai Linh/Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\nNguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party and the country's most powerful politician, has died following months of ill health, official media said Friday. He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral would be held.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nTrong's legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said.\n\n\"Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms doesn't really matter as much as personal power,\" Giang said.\n\nVietanamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18 while Trong received treatment for his ill health. As Vietnam's top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in it.\n\nThe party's Politburo asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from its central office which was the first official confirmation of Trong's poor health.\n\nRumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin.\n\nTrong' death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted \"a very uncertain time\" in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are \"very shaky.\"\n\n\"Now it isn't only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,\" Giang said.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"},

He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral would be held.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party\u00b4s power in Vietnam\u00b4s single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party\u00b4s legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party\u00b4s helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nFILE - Vietnamese General Secretary of the Communist Party Nguyen Phu Trong addresses the media in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Sept. 10, 2023. The powerful head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, has died, official media say on Friday, July 19, 2024. (Luong Thai Linh/Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant\u00b4s flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nTrong\u00b4s legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore\u00b4s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said.\n\n\"Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms doesn\u00b4t really matter as much as personal power,\" Giang said.\n\nVietanamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18 while Trong received treatment for his ill health. As Vietnam\u00b4s top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in it.\n\nThe party\u00b4s Politburo asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from its central office which was the first official confirmation of Trong\u00b4s poor health.\n\nRumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin.\n\nTrong\u00b4 death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted \"a very uncertain time\" in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are \"very shaky.\"\n\n\"Now it isn\u00b4t only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,\" Giang said.\n\nFILE - Vietnamese President To Lam speaks during a press briefing with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, on June 20, 2024. To Lam on Thursday July 18, 2024 became the caretaker of the Communist Party because of party chief Nguyen Phu Trong's poor health, the party said in a statement.

to 'focus' on health, caretaker assigned: party", "body": "Vietnam's 80-year-old leader and Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong will take a break to \"focus\" on his health, the party said on Thursday.\n\nPresident To Lam would take over as the country's caretaker leader, the party said in an online statement.\n\nThe party said Lam had been assigned to lead the works of the party central committee, the politburo, the secretariat, while Trong would \"focus on active treatment\".\n\nLed by the Communist Party general secretary, Vietnam's leadership structure gives the president the second-most authority -- but the position is largely seen as ceremonial.\n\nThe communist government's four-person hierarchy also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.\n\nTrong's ailing health has fuelled widespread speculation that he will not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress that is expected to appoint a successor.\n\nIn office since 2011, the party leader has enjoyed remarkable longevity in his role, which rights groups say has coincided with Vietnam's drift toward authoritarianism.\n\nLam, 67, served as Vietnam's public security minister before being voted in as president by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after a major anti-corruption campaign forced his predecessor to resign.\n\nThousands of people -- including several senior government and business leaders -- have been caught up in the Southeast Asian country's crackdown on graft, led by Trong.\n\nAnalysts have said that Lam, who is deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption, has weaponised its investigations to take down his political rivals.\n\nIn his first remarks as president, Lam said he was \"determined to fight corruption and negative phenomena\".\n\nbur/srg/fox\n\nMore from this section\n\nFoundation for a Drug-Free World Drug Prevention Nonprofit Earns Consultative Status to the UN\n\n[Updated!] Pokemon GO Failed to

He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral will be held.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nTrong's legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said.\n\n\"Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms doesn't really matter as much as personal power,\" Giang said.\n\nVietnamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18 while Trong received treatment for his ill health. As Vietnam's top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in it.\n\nThe party's Politburo asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from its central office which was the first official confirmation of Trong's poor health.\n\nRumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin.\n\nTrong' death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted \"a very uncertain time\" in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are \"very shaky.\"\n\n\"Now it isn't only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,\" Giang said.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"},

He also served as president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nDuring his time in office, he oversaw a period of rapid economic growth as well as a balancing of ties with China and Vietnam's former foe, the US. Trong was known for his \"blazing furnace\" anti-corruption drive, under which even senior political figures, including former presidents, were forced to resign.\n\nThere had been speculation about Trong's health for months, fuelled by his absences from recent meetings.\n\n\"General secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, passed away at 13:38 on 19 July 2024, at the 108 Central Military hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOn Thursday, it was announced he would step back from his role as head of the Communist party, due to unspecified health concerns, with president To Lam instead taking over his duties. Trong was awarded the Gold Star medal, the country's highest honour for public officials, on the same day.\n\nTrong will be remembered for his anti-corruption campaigns, which were unprecedented in the history of the party. Since 2016, more than 139,000 party members have been punished for corruption - a crackdown so vast it was blamed for negative impacts on the economy, with officials reluctant to sign off approvals, fearful of being accused of wrongdoing.\n\nIn pursuing such crackdowns, he \"consolidated an unrivalled level of power within the political system,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme of the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\nAny plans that he had for an orderly succession transition had gone unrealised, he added, and his death risks creating a power vacuum.\n\nGiang added: \"I think this will lead [to] a very difficult time for Vietnam, for the political allies to negotiate among themselves who will assume the position of Nguyen Phu Trong. That might lead to a succession crisis where different factions would not agree.\"\n\nGiven Trong's power and popularity, analysts say any successor is unlikely to deviate from his policies in relation to the economy, foreign policy, or the lack of tolerance for government critics.\n\nThere are now more than 160 people held in prison for peacefully exercising their civil and political rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe courts convicted at least 28 rights campaigners and sentenced them to long prison terms during the first 10 months of 2023, the group said.\n\nIn his foreign policy, Trong pursued a so-called \"bamboo diplomacy\" - which 'sways with the winds' and avoids picking sides in international disputes - including in relation to the rivalry between the US and China.\n\nIn 2015, he became the first general secretary of the Communist party to pay an official visit to the US, where he met with the former president Barack Obama.\n\nLast year Trong hosted the US president, Joe Biden, and upgraded ties with Washington, as well as with Australia and Japan. China's president, Xi Jinping, also made a state visit three months later.\n\nChina's Communist party central committee said the Chinese people had lost a \"good comrade, brother and friend\", Chinese

As Vietnam's top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in it.\n\nThe party's Politburo asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from its central office which was the first official confirmation of Trong's poor health.\n\nRumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin.\n\nTrong' death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted \"a very uncertain time\" in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are \"very shaky.\"\n\n\"Now it isn't only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,\" Giang said.\n\nThe central committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent its condolences to its Vietnamese counterpart and \"deeply mourned\" Trong's death, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"},

He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral would be held.\n\nWATCH: The significance of Biden's trip to Vietnam in the face of China's growing influence\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nTrong's legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said.\n\n\"Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms doesn't really matter as much as personal power,\" Giang said.\n\nVietanamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18 while Trong received treatment for his ill health. As Vietnam's top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in it.\n\nREAD MORE: Putin signs deals with Vietnam in effort to bolster ties in Asia to offset Moscow's growing isolation\n\nThe party's Politburo asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from its central office which was the first official confirmation of Trong's poor health.\n\nRumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin.\n\nTrong' death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted \"a very uncertain time\" in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are \"very shaky.\"\n\n\"Now it isn't only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,\" Giang said.\n\nThe central committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent its condolences to its Vietnamese counterpart and \"deeply mourned\" Trong's death, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors":

File Image/Reuters\n\nNguyen Phu Trong, the influential General Secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, passed away on July 19, at the age of 80. His death marks the end of an era for Vietnam, where he held the most powerful position for over 13 years.\n\nDuring his tenure, Trong oversaw rapid economic growth, launched a rigourous anti-corruption campaign, and steered the country's foreign policy towards a pragmatic and balanced approach known as \"Bamboo Diplomacy.\"\n\nBorn in Hanoi in 1944, Trong was a staunch Marxist-Leninist who earned a degree in philosophy before joining the Communist Party at the age of 22. He furthered his education in the Soviet Union, which shaped much of his ideological and political outlook. Despite his ideological leanings, Trong was known for nurturing relations with both the United States and China, reflecting his flexible and strategic approach to foreign policy.\n\nTrong had also served as president of Vietnam from 2018 to 2021.\n\nA look at Trong's rise to power\n\nTrong ascended to the role of General Secretary of the Communist Party in 2011, a position he held until his death. Prior to this, he served as the Party committee secretary of Hanoi and as the Chairman of the National Assembly from 2006 to 2011.\n\nHis rise to power was marked by his ability to consolidate the Communist Party's influence, particularly at a time when the governmental wing, led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, was gaining prominence.\n\nIn 2021, he secured an unprecedented third term as General Secretary after the party waived the two-term limit, underscoring his significant political clout. However, his later years in office were marked by declining health, leading to his hospitalisation in 2019 and subsequent frailty at public events.\n\nTrong's 'blazing furnace'\n\nTrong is perhaps best known for his aggressive anti-corruption campaign, dubbed the \"blazing furnace.\" Launched in 2017, this campaign targeted both business and political elites, resulting in the investigation and resignation of hundreds of officials, including cabinet ministers, a parliament chairman, and two state presidents (Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong).\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong stated in 2016, highlighting his belief in maintaining the party's legitimacy through strict discipline.\n\nThe campaign, while praised for its rigour, also had unintended consequences. Nguyen Khac Giang of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute also wrote in Fulcrum that the crackdown eroded the institutional balance within the Communist Party, shifting the dynamics towards personal power rather than established norms.\n\nTrong's 'Bamboo Diplomacy'\n\nTrong's foreign policy strategy, coined as \"Bamboo Diplomacy,\" symbolised Vietnam's resilience and adaptability in the complex geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. This approach allowed Vietnam to maintain robust economic and political relations with both the United States and China, despite the rising tensions between the two superpowers.\n\n\"Vietnam's diplomacy is described as soft and wise, yet persistent and resolute,\" Trong explained during the National Congress on External Relations in 2021. \"It is characterised by being flexible and creative in the face of all struggles and challenges that stand in the way of national independence and people's happiness.\"\n\nNotably, Trong was invited to India on a four-day State visit in November 2013 when he was received by then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi. Then President Ram Nath Kovind visited Hanoi and met Trong in 2018 who was then president of the Southeast Asian nation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also held an audience with Trong in 2016 during his visit to Hanoi.\n\nUnder Trong's leadership, Vietnam elevated its ties with the United States to the highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership. He hosted both US President Joe Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi, showcasing Vietnam's balanced approach. The US embassy in Vietnam lauded him as a \"visionary leader who for decades served as a bridge between Vietnam and the United States of America.\"\n\nVietnam's economy under Trong\n\nVietnam's economy flourished under Trong's leadership. By 2022, the country's total exports reached $371.3 billion, with imports amounting to $358.9 billion, reflecting a 9.1 per cent increase compared to the previous year. High-tech items like phones and computers made up approximately $170 billion of these exports.\n\nThis economic boom attracted multinational giants such as Samsung, Intel, Canon, and Foxconn to establish large factories in Vietnam.\n\nTrong's pragmatic approach also involved balancing relations between major powers. In 2023, when the USS Ronald Reagan visited Vietnam, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh was in China, underscoring Vietnam's diplomatic balancing act. These events highlighted Vietnam's efforts to maintain political trust and enhance strategic cooperation with both the United States and China.\n\nWho will replace Trong?\n\nFollowing Trong's death, his duties were temporarily assigned to Vietnamese President To Lam, a prominent figure in the party and a key player in the anti-corruption campaign. Lam, who became president in May 2024, is seen as a likely successor to Trong. However, his potential consolidation of power raises concerns about increased autocracy and a potential crackdown on civil liberties.\n\nVietnam's leadership structure consists of four key positions: the Communist Party general secretary, the president, the prime minister, and the head of the National Assembly, the four bureaucratic positions have been informally dubbed the \"four pillars\" in regard to leadership and decision-making in the country.\n\nPeter Mumford of the Eurasia Group noted that Lam's leadership could \"moderate political instability and factional infighting,\" which might benefit economic growth, reported Reuters. However, some analysts fear that Vietnam might drift towards a more China-style rule if Lam amasses unchecked power.\n\nIn the wake of Trong's death, Vietnam observed a period of national mourning, with public events cancelled and state-run websites displaying black and white banners. State broadcasters aired documentaries celebrating his life and leadership.\n\nAlso Read: Who is To Lam, Vietnam's top cop now elected president?\n\nNguyen Phu Trong leaves behind a mixed legacy marked by economic achievements, a rigourous anti-corruption drive, and a vision of \"Bamboo Diplomacy\" which will continue to influence Vietnam's strategic decisions in the years to come.",

He also served as the nation's president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nTrong died after a period of illness at 1:38 p.m. Friday at a military hospital in Hanoi, the statement said. The leader died \"due to old age and serious illness, despite getting dedicated treatment\" from his doctors and the nation's leading medical experts, the government said.\n\nThe government canceled a series of music performances across the country, according to local media reports. The government's website was turned into a shade of grey after the announcement of Trong's death.\n\nArguably the country's most influential leader since Ho Chi Minh, Trong oversaw a vast economic expansion including deeper ties with both China and a former foe, the U.S. Under his watch, Vietnam unleashed a sweeping campaign to root out corruption that has ensnared hundreds of officials and business leaders.\n\nThe politburo on Thursday tapped President To Lam to become the interim leader due to Trong's health emergency.\n\nTrong was elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 2011 and reelected to the position in 2016 and 2021. He also become president in 2018, a break from party tradition following the death of then-President Tran Dai Quang. Trong relinquished the presidency in 2021, but his election that year to a rare third term as general secretary made him the longest-serving party leader since Le Duan, who held the post from 1960 until his death in 1986.\n\nTrong headed the nation's central steering committee to tackle corruption since 2013. In recent years, he likened his anti-graft campaign to a \"blazing furnace,\" one that since at least 2021 has caught scores of government officials and business executives alike in its flames.\n\nThe crackdown has been portrayed as part of Vietnam's attempts to bolster its appeal as a destination for foreign investment in the midst of a heated competition between the U.S. and China, and to ensure the party's legitimacy in the face of wide-ranging scandals. However, it also led to widespread fear among bureaucrats, causing them to foot-drag on decision-making and approval of legal documents needed for new development and other business-related activities.\n\n\"Nguyen Phu Trong is undoubtedly the most influential Vietnamese politician of the 21st century,\" Linh Nguyen, lead analyst for Vietnam at Control Risks. \"He leaves a legacy of a party's unquestioned power fully restored and an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign that has cracked down hundreds corrupted senior politicians.\"\n\nTrong was a strong proponent of opening the once-isolated nation to foreign investment. Vietnam transformed into one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world with the signing of numerous free-trade agreements. As of end 2023, the value of Vietnam's exports roughly equaled the size of its economy, with former foe U.S. now its largest export market.\n\nIn 2015, Trong became the first party chief to visit the U.S. when he met former President Barack Obama at the White House. On that occasion, Obama said the \"difficult history\" between the US and Vietnam was being replaced by a relationship based on mutual economic and security interests in a region that was growing wary of China's rise. Trong said the US and Vietnam had managed to \"rise above the past\" to become friends.\n\nPossible successors\n\nThe selection of a leader is a highly secretive process and analysts expect the vacancy at the top could spark fierce competition within the politburo and the central executive committee.\n\nLam is in a strong position to become the next party chief, but it's not guaranteed. The former security minister and Trong's long-time anti-corruption crusader helped lift Vietnam's ranking in Transparency International's corruption perceptions index to 83 last year from 113 in 2016.\n\nTrong was born in Hanoi on April 14, 1944. His official biography says he came from a \"poor peasant\" family, according to state-owned Vietnam News.\n\nHe earned a bachelor's degree in philology, the study of language and literature, at Vietnam National University in 1967, according to the government's website. He had been interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography posted to the website of the university, which also displayed one of his first published works, a 1967 review of folk poetry, Reuters reported in 2021.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nTrong defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Party Building Department of the Academy of Social Sciences of the former Soviet Union in 1983. He took a postgraduate course in economics and politics at the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics from 1973 to 1976.\n\nWith his prior experience as Hanoi's party secretary and chairman of the National Assembly, Trong was chosen as a compromise candidate for the general secretary position in 2011, said Le Hong Hiep, a former foreign ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Vietnam Studies Program of ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\nDuring a 2016 power struggle with Nguyen Tan Dung, Trong outmaneuvered the then prime minister to capture his second term as party chief, Hiep said. \"Beneath his grandfatherly appearance, Trong proved to be a determined and skilled politician.\"\n\nIn 2021, he was chosen for a third term as general secretary reportedly because the party could not reach a consensus on his successor.\n\nTrong's waning health was the topic of speculation for years. He appeared concerned about taking on the presidency in 2018, citing his \"worrisome\" old age and weakening health during an acceptance speech to the National Assembly.\n\nAfter being reelected party chief in 2021, he also said he would have preferred to retire because \"I'm old and not in good health.\" At the time, he failed to get a preferred candidate to replace him during the party reshuffle, forcing him to stay on as party chief.\n\nHe was hospitalized early January this year over an unspecified illness.\n\n-------\n\n(With assistance from Cecilia Yap, Philip J.

He was 80.\n\nTrong's duties have been temporarily assigned to President To Lam, a rising star within the party who could further consolidate his powers if he is allowed to keep the two roles.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences on the death of the Vietnamese leader.\n\n\"Saddened by the news of the passing away of the Vietnamese leader, General Secretary H.E. Nguyen Phu Trong. We pay our respects to the departed leader. Extend our deepest condolences and stand in solidarity with the people and leadership of Vietnam in this hour of grief,\" PM Modi said in an X post.\n\nTrong died in the early afternoon \"due to old age and serious illness\", the Communist Party said in a statement on its website, without elaborating further on the nature of the illness.\n\nThe statement cited information from Trong's medical team, saying he died \"after a period of illness, despite being wholeheartedly treated by the Party, the State, a collective of professors, doctors, leading medical experts\".\n\nLam had taken over Trong's duties on Thursday as the party chief was ailing. The party will now need to decide whether Lam will be formally appointed as acting party chief until the current term for the post expires in 2026, or whether it will elect a new head before then from within its ranks.\n\nAlthough Vietnam officially has no paramount ruler, Trong was the country's most powerful figure as party general secretary and had been in the post since 2011.\n\nHe secured a third term in 2021 after a rule limiting holders to two terms as party boss was waived, demonstrating his strength and significant political clout in a party that has ruled unified Vietnam for nearly half a century.\n\nBut in recent months, he appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings.\n\nA consolidation of power under Lam was seen by some business people and analysts as potentially positive to speed up decision-making in the Southeast Asian nation, which is home to large factories of top multinationals, including Samsung, Intel, Canon and Apple's top supplier Foxconn.\n\nA clear shift to Lam's leadership \"could moderate political instability and factional infighting, at least in the short term,\" said Peter Mumford, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Eurasia Group, noting that would be beneficial to economic growth.\n\nBut some diplomats and activists saw also risks of a crackdown on civil liberties and a drift toward more autocratic, China-style rule, if Lam were allowed to concentrate more unchecked powers in his hands, in a break with the party's tradition of collegial decision-making.\n\nAfter Trong's death was announced, public events were cancelled across the country until July 25 while state-run websites had their banners turned black and white.\n\nState broadcasters ran a documentary about Trong titled: \"General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong: a steadfast, intellectual, exemplary leader\".\n\nBars in the capital, Hanoi, declined to serve drinks or play music on Friday evening. Several Vietnamese Facebook users changed their profile picture into a national mourning flag.\n\nTrong was educated in the Soviet Union and was regarded as a Marxist-Leninist ideologue, but he nonetheless nurtured ties with the United States.\n\nIn 2017 he unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\", under which hundreds of officials were investigated for graft and many forced to quit, including cabinet ministers, a parliament chairman and two state presidents.\n\nThe operation had a chilling effect on investment.\n\nLam, a former chief of the powerful internal security agency, has been a key player in that campaign and was elected president in May after his predecessor resigned amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.\n\nTrong hosted both U.S. President Joe Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi last year, boosting relations with both countries despite increasing tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Vietnam said in a statement Trong was a \"visionary leader who for decades served as a bridge between Vietnam and the United States of America\", and praised him for being the first Vietnamese party leader to visit the United States.\n\nChina's Communist Party also sent a message of condolence to Vietnam, calling him a \"staunch Marxist\" and \"a good comrade,

He also served as president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nDuring his time in office, he oversaw a period of rapid economic growth as well as a balancing of ties with China and Vietnam's former foe, the US. Trong was known for his \"blazing furnace\" anti-corruption drive, under which even senior political figures, including former presidents, were forced to resign.\n\nThere had been speculation about Trong's health for months, fuelled by his absences from recent meetings.\n\n\"General secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, passed away at 13:38 on 19 July 2024, at the 108 Central Military hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOn Thursday, it was announced he would step back from his role as head of the Communist party, due to unspecified health concerns, with president To Lam instead taking over his duties. Trong was awarded the Gold Star medal, the country's highest honour for public officials, on the same day.\n\nTrong will be remembered for his anti-corruption campaigns, which were unprecedented in the history of the party. Since 2016, more than 139,000 party members have been punished for corruption - a crackdown so vast it was blamed for negative impacts on the economy, with officials reluctant to sign off approvals, fearful of being accused of wrongdoing.\n\nRelated: Vietnam loses its second president in two years amid concerns for political stability\n\nIn pursuing such crackdowns, he \"consolidated an unrivalled level of power within the political system,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme of the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\nAny plans that he had for an orderly succession transition had gone unrealised, he added, and his death risks creating a power vacuum.\n\nGiang added: \"I think this will lead [to] a very difficult time for Vietnam, for the political allies to negotiate among themselves who will assume the position of Nguyen Phu Trong. That might lead to a succession crisis where different factions would not agree.\"\n\nGiven Trong's power and popularity, analysts say any successor is unlikely to deviate from his policies in relation to the economy, foreign policy, or the lack of tolerance for government critics.\n\nThere are now more than 160 people held in prison for peacefully exercising their civil and political rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe courts convicted at least 28 rights campaigners and sentenced them to long prison terms during the first 10 months of 2023, the group said.\n\nIn his foreign policy, Trong pursued a so-called \"bamboo diplomacy\" - which 'sways with the winds' and avoids picking sides in international disputes - including in relation to the rivalry between the US and China.\n\nIn 2015, he became the first general secretary of the Communist party to pay an official visit to the US, where he met with the former president Barack Obama.\n\nLast year Trong hosted the US president, Joe Biden, and upgraded ties with Washington, as well as with Australia and Japan. China's president, Xi Jinping, also made a state visit three months later.\n\nChina's Communist party central committee said the Chinese people had lost a \"good comrade, brother and friend\", Chinese

He also served as the nation's president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nTrong died after a period of illness at 1:38 p.m. Friday at a military hospital in Hanoi, the statement said. The leader died \"due to old age and serious illness, despite getting dedicated treatment\" from his doctors and the nation's leading medical experts, the government said.\n\nThe government canceled a series of music performances across the country, according to local media reports. The government's website was turned into a shade of grey after the announcement of Trong's death.\n\nArguably the country's most influential leader since Ho Chi Minh, Trong oversaw a vast economic expansion including deeper ties with both China and a former foe, the U.S. Under his watch, Vietnam unleashed a sweeping campaign to root out corruption that has ensnared hundreds of officials and business leaders.\n\nThe politburo on Thursday tapped President To Lam to become the interim leader due to Trong's health emergency.\n\nTrong was elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 2011 and reelected to the position in 2016 and 2021. He also become president in 2018, a break from party tradition following the death of then-President Tran Dai Quang. Trong relinquished the presidency in 2021, but his election that year to a rare third term as general secretary made him the longest-serving party leader since Le Duan, who held the post from 1960 until his death in 1986.\n\nTrong headed the nation's central steering committee to tackle corruption since 2013. In recent years, he likened his anti-graft campaign to a \"blazing furnace,\" one that since at least 2021 has caught scores of government officials and business executives alike in its flames.\n\nThe crackdown has been portrayed as part of Vietnam's attempts to bolster its appeal as a destination for foreign investment in the midst of a heated competition between the U.S. and China, and to ensure the party's legitimacy in the face of wide-ranging scandals. However, it also led to widespread fear among bureaucrats, causing them to foot-drag on decision-making and approval of legal documents needed for new development and other business-related activities.\n\n\"Nguyen Phu Trong is undoubtedly the most influential Vietnamese politician of the 21st century,\" Linh Nguyen, lead analyst for Vietnam at Control Risks. \"He leaves a legacy of a party's unquestioned power fully restored and an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign that has cracked down hundreds corrupted senior politicians.\"\n\nTrong was a strong proponent of opening the once-isolated nation to foreign investment. Vietnam transformed into one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world with the signing of numerous free-trade agreements. As of end 2023, the value of Vietnam's exports roughly equaled the size of its economy, with former foe U.S. now its largest export market.\n\nIn 2015, Trong became the first party chief to visit the U.S. when he met former President Barack Obama at the White House. On that occasion, Obama said the \"difficult history\" between the US and Vietnam was being replaced by a relationship based on mutual economic and security interests in a region that was growing wary of China's rise. Trong said the US and Vietnam had managed to \"rise above the past\" to become friends.\n\nPossible successors\n\nThe selection of a leader is a highly secretive process and analysts expect the vacancy at the top could spark fierce competition within the politburo and the central executive committee.\n\nLam is in a strong position to become the next party chief, but it's not guaranteed. The former security minister and Trong's long-time anti-corruption crusader helped lift Vietnam's ranking in Transparency International's corruption perceptions index to 83 last year from 113 in 2016.\n\nTrong was born in Hanoi on April 14, 1944. His official biography says he came from a \"poor peasant\" family, according to state-owned Vietnam News.\n\nHe earned a bachelor's degree in philology, the study of language and literature, at Vietnam National University in 1967, according to the government's website. He had been interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography posted to the website of the university, which also displayed one of his first published works, a 1967 review of folk poetry, Reuters reported in 2021.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nTrong defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Party Building Department of the Academy of Social Sciences of the former Soviet Union in 1983. He took a postgraduate course in economics and politics at the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics from 1973 to 1976.\n\nWith his prior experience as Hanoi's party secretary and chairman of the National Assembly, Trong was chosen as a compromise candidate for the general secretary position in 2011, said Le Hong Hiep, a former foreign ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Vietnam Studies Program of ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\nDuring a 2016 power struggle with Nguyen Tan Dung, Trong outmaneuvered the then prime minister to capture his second term as party chief, Hiep said. \"Beneath his grandfatherly appearance, Trong proved to be a determined and skilled politician.\"\n\nIn 2021, he was chosen for a third term as general secretary reportedly because the party could not reach a consensus on his successor.\n\nTrong's waning health was the topic of speculation for years. He appeared concerned about taking on the presidency in 2018, citing his \"worrisome\" old age and weakening health during an acceptance speech to the National Assembly.\n\nAfter being reelected party chief in 2021, he also said he would have preferred to retire because \"I'm old and not in good health.\" At the time, he failed to get a preferred candidate to replace him during the party reshuffle, forcing him to stay on as party chief.\n\nHe was hospitalized early January this year over an unspecified illness.\n\n-------\n\n(With assistance from Cecilia Yap, Philip J.

The party did not clarify what treatment he is receiving, and a spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs had no additional information to share when asked at a regular media briefing.\n\nLam, a former head of internal security, has been widely seen as a top candidate to replace Trong when his term ends in 2026.

But in recent months, he has appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings.\n\nIn a surprise move, the Politburo awarded Trong on Thursday the Gold Star medal, the country\u2019s highest honour for public officials.\n\nLam was elected president in May after several top leaders quit amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.\n\nLam, a key player in the crackdown, promised after his election to \u201cresolutely and persistently continue the fight against corruption\u201d, despite its negative impact on public investment.\n\n\u201cWhoever takes over from Trong to become the next party chief, it is essential to keep his anti-corruption campaign legacy to have the authority in front of other political elites, keep the system\u2019s stability and gain favour from others,\u201d said Giang.\n\nVietnam\u2019s main stock market edged up 0.5 per cent after the announcement.\n\nA Hanoi-based senior Western diplomat said he saw Lam\u2019s expanded powers as good for stability.\n\nBut the diplomat, who declined to be identified, added: \u201cWe\u2019ll need to see if this has an impact on economic, foreign and domestic policies and in which direction.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party_Committee_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u00f4_L\u00e2m", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T\u00f4 L\u00e2m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Ph\u00fa_Tr\u1ecdng", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISEAS\u2013Yusof_Ishak_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Unity Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\u2013Leninism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marxism\u2013Leninism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_under_Xi_Jinping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/18/fbb00d69-5a16-4eee-81a6-232e42521799_cba02400.jpg?itok=7TCMzK1t", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He also served as the nation's president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nTrong died after a period of illness at 1:38 p.m. Friday at a military hospital in Hanoi, the statement said. The leader died \"due to old age and serious illness, despite getting dedicated treatment\" from his doctors and the nation's leading medical experts, the government said.\n\nThe government canceled a series of music performances across the country, according to local media reports. The government's website was turned into a shade of grey after the announcement of Trong's death.\n\nArguably the country's most influential leader since Ho Chi Minh, Trong oversaw a vast economic expansion including deeper ties with both China and a former foe, the U.S. Under his watch, Vietnam unleashed a sweeping campaign to root out corruption that has ensnared hundreds of officials and business leaders.\n\nThe politburo on Thursday tapped President To Lam to become the interim leader due to Trong's health emergency.\n\nTrong was elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 2011 and reelected to the position in 2016 and 2021. He also become president in 2018, a break from party tradition following the death of then-President Tran Dai Quang. Trong relinquished the presidency in 2021, but his election that year to a rare third term as general secretary made him the longest-serving party leader since Le Duan, who held the post from 1960 until his death in 1986.\n\nTrong headed the nation's central steering committee to tackle corruption since 2013. In recent years, he likened his anti-graft campaign to a \"blazing furnace,\" one that since at least 2021 has caught scores of government officials and business executives alike in its flames.\n\nThe crackdown has been portrayed as part of Vietnam's attempts to bolster its appeal as a destination for foreign investment in the midst of a heated competition between the U.S. and China, and to ensure the party's legitimacy in the face of wide-ranging scandals. However, it also led to widespread fear among bureaucrats, causing them to foot-drag on decision-making and approval of legal documents needed for new development and other business-related activities.\n\n\"Nguyen Phu Trong is undoubtedly the most influential Vietnamese politician of the 21st century,\" Linh Nguyen, lead analyst for Vietnam at Control Risks. \"He leaves a legacy of a party's unquestioned power fully restored and an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign that has cracked down hundreds corrupted senior politicians.\"\n\nTrong was a strong proponent of opening the once-isolated nation to foreign investment. Vietnam transformed into one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world with the signing of numerous free-trade agreements. As of end 2023, the value of Vietnam's exports roughly equaled the size of its economy, with former foe U.S. now its largest export market.\n\nIn 2015, Trong became the first party chief to visit the U.S. when he met former President Barack Obama at the White House. On that occasion, Obama said the \"difficult history\" between the U.S. and Vietnam was being replaced by a relationship based on mutual economic and security interests in a region that was growing wary of China's rise. Trong said the U.S. and Vietnam had managed to \"rise above the past\" to become friends.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden echoed those sentiments on Friday, saying in a statement \"the people of Vietnam and the United States - and people across the Indo-Pacific region - enjoy greater security and opportunity today because of the friendship between our two countries,\" calling his 2015 visit \"historic.\"\n\nPossible successors\n\nThe selection of a leader is a highly secretive process and analysts expect the vacancy at the top could spark fierce competition within the politburo and the central executive committee.\n\nLam is in a strong position to become the next party chief, but it's not guaranteed. The former security minister and Trong's long-time anti-corruption crusader helped lift Vietnam's ranking in Transparency International's corruption perceptions index to 83 last year from 113 in 2016.\n\nTrong was born in Hanoi on April 14, 1944. His official biography says he came from a \"poor peasant\" family, according to state-owned Vietnam News.\n\nHe earned a bachelor's degree in philology, the study of language and literature, at Vietnam National University in 1967, according to the government's website. He had been interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography posted to the website of the university, which also displayed one of his first published works, a 1967 review of folk poetry, Reuters reported in 2021.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nTrong defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Party Building Department of the Academy of Social Sciences of the former Soviet Union in 1983. He took a postgraduate course in economics and politics at the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics from 1973 to 1976.\n\nWith his prior experience as Hanoi's party secretary and chairman of the National Assembly, Trong was chosen as a compromise candidate for the general secretary position in 2011, said Le Hong Hiep, a former foreign ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Vietnam Studies Program of ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\nDuring a 2016 power struggle with Nguyen Tan Dung, Trong outmaneuvered the then prime minister to capture his second term as party chief, Hiep said. \"Beneath his grandfatherly appearance, Trong proved to be a determined and skilled politician.\"\n\nIn 2021, he was chosen for a third term as general secretary reportedly because the party could not reach a consensus on his successor.\n\nTrong's waning health was the topic of speculation for years. He appeared concerned about taking on the presidency in 2018, citing his \"worrisome\" old age and weakening health during an acceptance speech to the National Assembly.\n\nAfter being reelected party chief in 2021, he also said he would have preferred to retire because \"I'm old and not in good health.\" At the time, he failed to get a preferred candidate to replace him during the party reshuffle, forcing him to stay on as party chief.\n\nHe was hospitalized early January this year over an unspecified illness.\n\n-------\n\n(With assistance from Cecilia Yap, Philip J.

He also served as the nation's president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nTrong died after a period of illness at 1.38pm on Friday at a military hospital in Hanoi, the statement said. The leader died \"due to old age and serious illness, despite getting dedicated treatment\" from his doctors and the nation's leading medical experts, the government said.\n\nThe government cancelled a series of music performances across the country, according to local media reports. The government's website was turned into a shade of grey after the announcement of Trong's death.\n\nArguably the country's most influential leader since Ho Chi Minh, Trong oversaw a vast economic expansion including deeper ties with both China and a former foe, the United States. Under his watch, Vietnam unleashed a sweeping campaign to root out corruption that has ensnared hundreds of officials and business leaders.\n\nThe politburo on Thursday tapped President To Lam to become the interim leader due to Trong's health emergency.\n\nTrong was elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 2011 and re-elected to the position in 2016 and 2021. He also become president in 2018, a break from party tradition following the death of then-President Tran Dai Quang. Trong relinquished the presidency in 2021, but his election that year to a rare third term as general secretary made him the longest-serving party leader since Le Duan, who held the post from 1960 until his death in 1986.\n\nTrong headed the nation's central steering committee to tackle corruption since 2013. In recent years, he likened his anti-graft campaign to a \"blazing furnace,\" one that since at least 2021 has caught scores of government officials and business executives alike in its flames.\n\nThe crackdown has been portrayed as part of Vietnam's attempts to bolster its appeal as a destination for foreign investment in the midst of a heated competition between the US and China, and to ensure the party's legitimacy in the face of wide-ranging scandals. However, it also led to widespread fear among bureaucrats, causing them to foot-drag on decision-making and approval of legal documents needed for new development and other business-related activities.\n\n\"Nguyen Phu Trong is undoubtedly the most influential Vietnamese politician of the 21st century,\" Linh Nguyen, lead analyst for Vietnam at Control Risks. \"He leaves a legacy of a party's unquestioned power fully restored and an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign that has cracked down hundreds corrupted senior politicians.\"\n\nTrong was a strong proponent of opening the once-isolated nation to foreign investment. Vietnam transformed into one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world with the signing of numerous free-trade agreements. As of end 2023, the value of Vietnam's exports roughly equaled the size of its economy, with former foe US now its largest export market.\n\nIn 2015, Trong became the first party chief to visit the US when he met former President Barack Obama at the White House. On that occasion, Obama said the \"difficult history\" between the US and Vietnam was being replaced by a relationship based on mutual economic and security interests in a region that was growing wary of China's rise. Trong said the US and Vietnam had managed to \"rise above the past\" to become friends.\n\nPossible successors\n\nThe selection of a leader is a highly secretive process, and analysts expect the vacancy at the top could spark fierce competition within the politburo and the central executive committee.\n\nLam is in a strong position to become the next party chief, but it's not guaranteed. The former security minister and Trong's long-time anti-corruption crusader helped lift Vietnam's ranking in Transparency International's corruption perceptions index to 83 last year from 113 in 2016.\n\nTrong was born in Hanoi on April 14, 1944. His official biography says he came from a \"poor peasant\" family, according to state-owned Vietnam News.\n\nHe earned a bachelor's degree in philology, the study of language and literature, at Vietnam National University in 1967, according to the government's website. He had been interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography posted to the website of the university, which also displayed one of his first published works, a 1967 review of folk poetry, Reuters reported in 2021.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nTrong defended his PhD thesis at the Party Building Department of the Academy of Social Sciences of the former Soviet Union in 1983. He took a postgraduate course in economics and politics at the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics from 1973 to 1976.\n\nWith his prior experience as Hanoi's party secretary and chairman of the National Assembly, Trong was chosen as a compromise candidate for the general secretary position in 2011, said Le Hong Hiep, a former foreign ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Vietnam Studies Program of ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\nDuring a 2016 power struggle with Nguyen Tan Dung, Trong outmanoeuvred the then prime minister to capture his second term as party chief, Hiep said. \"Beneath his grandfatherly appearance, Trong proved to be a determined and skilled politician.\"\n\nIn 2021, he was chosen for a third term as general secretary reportedly because the party could not reach a consensus on his successor.\n\nTrong's waning health was the topic of speculation for years. He appeared concerned about taking on the presidency in 2018, citing his \"worrisome\" old age and weakening health during an acceptance speech to the National Assembly.\n\nAfter being re-elected party chief in 2021, he also said he would have preferred to retire because \"I'm old and not in good health.\" At the time, he failed to get a preferred candidate to replace him during the party reshuffle, forcing him to stay on as party chief.\n\nHe was hospitalised early January this year over an unspecified illness.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He was 80.\n\nTrong's duties have been temporarily assigned to President To Lam, a rising star within the party who could further consolidate his power if he is allowed to keep the two roles.\n\nTrong died in the early afternoon 'due to old age and serious illness,' the Communist Party said in a statement on its website, without elaborating further on the nature of the illness.\n\nThe statement cited information from Trong's medical team, saying he died 'after a period of illness, despite being wholeheartedly treated by the Party, the State, a collective of professors, doctors, leading medical experts.'\n\nLam had taken over Trong's duties on Thursday as the party chief was ailing. The party will now need to decide whether Lam will be formally appointed as acting party chief until the current term for the post expires in 2026, or whether it will elect a new head before then from within its ranks.\n\nAlthough Vietnam officially has no paramount ruler, Trong was the country's most powerful figure as party general secretary and had been in the post since 2011.\n\nHe secured a third term in 2021 after a rule limiting holders to two terms as party boss was waived, demonstrating his strength and significant political clout in a party that has ruled unified Vietnam for nearly half a century.\n\nBut in recent months, he appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings.\n\nWith Lam in power\n\nA consolidation of power under Lam was seen by some businesspeople and analysts as potentially positive to speed up decision-making in the Southeast Asian nation, which is home to large factories of top multinationals, including Samsung Intel, Canon and Apple's top supplier, Foxconn.\n\nA clear shift to Lam's leadership 'could moderate political instability and factional infighting, at least in the short term,' said Peter Mumford, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Eurasia Group, noting that it would be beneficial to economic growth.\n\nFILE - Vietnamese President To Lam speaks during a press briefing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, unseen, at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, on June 20, 2024.\n\nBut some diplomats and activists saw risks of a crackdown on civil liberties and a drift toward more autocratic, China-style rule, if Lam were allowed to concentrate more unchecked powers in his hands, in a break with the party's tradition of collegial decision-making.\n\nAfter Trong's death was announced, public events were canceled across the country until July 25 while state-run websites had their banners turned black and white.\n\nState broadcasters ran a documentary about Trong titled: 'General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong: a steadfast, intellectual, exemplary leader.'\n\nBars in the capital, Hanoi, declined to serve drinks or play music on Friday evening. Several Vietnamese Facebook users changed their profile picture into a national mourning flag.\n\nMarxist-Leninist\n\nTrong was educated in the Soviet Union and was regarded as a Marxist-Leninist ideologue, but he nonetheless nurtured ties with the United States.\n\nIn 2017 he unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as 'blazing furnace,' under which hundreds of officials were investigated for graft and many forced to quit, including cabinet ministers, a parliament chairman and two state presidents.\n\nThe operation had a chilling effect on investment.\n\nLam, a former chief of the powerful internal security agency, has been a key player in that campaign and was elected president in May after his predecessor resigned amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.\n\nTrong hosted U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi last year, boosting relations with both countries despite increasing tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Vietnam said in a statement Trong was a 'visionary leader who for decades served as a bridge between Vietnam and the United States of America,' and praised him for being the first Vietnamese party leader to visit the United States.\n\nChina's Communist Party also sent a message of condolence to Vietnam, calling him a 'staunch Marxist' and 'a good comrade,

Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party and the country's most powerful politician, has died following months of ill health, official media said Friday. He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nOfficial media said a state funeral would be held.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, and disputes differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.

He was 80.\n\nTrong's duties have been temporarily assigned to President To Lam, a rising star within the party who could further consolidate his powers if he is allowed to keep the two roles.\n\nTrong died in the early afternoon \"due to old age and serious illness\", the Communist Party said in a statement, without elaborating further on the nature of the illness.\n\nThe statement cited information from Trong's medical team, saying he died \"after a period of illness, despite being wholeheartedly treated by the party, the state, a collective of professors, doctors, leading medical experts\".\n\nLam had taken over Trong's duties on Thursday as the party chief was ailing. The party will now need to decide whether Lam will be formally appointed as acting party chief until the current term for the post expires in 2026, or whether it will elect a new head before then from within its ranks.\n\nTrong hosted both US President Joe Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi last year, boosting relations with both countries despite increasing tensions between the US and China.\n\nBiden expressed his condolences, saying he was a champion of deep ties between the United States and Vietnam. The people of both countries \"enjoy greater security and opportunity today because of the friendship between our two countries. That is thanks to him,\" Biden said, praising him for being the first Vietnamese party leader to visit the United States.\n\nAlthough Vietnam officially has no paramount ruler, Trong was the country's most powerful figure as party general secretary and had been in the post since 2011.\n\nHe secured a third term in 2021 after a rule limiting holders to two terms as party boss was waived, demonstrating his strength and significant political clout in a party that has ruled unified Vietnam for nearly half a century.\n\nBut in recent months, he appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings.\n\nA consolidation of power under Lam was seen by some business people and analysts as potentially positive to speed up decision-making in the Southeast Asian nation, which is home to large factories of top multinationals, including Samsung , Intel, Canon and Apple's top supplier Foxconn.\n\nA clear shift to Lam's leadership \"could moderate political instability and factional infighting, at least in the short-term\", said Peter Mumford, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Eurasia Group, saying that would be beneficial to economic growth.\n\nBut some diplomats and activists saw risks of a crackdown on civil liberties and a drift toward more autocratic, China-style rule, if Lam were allowed to concentrate more unchecked powers in his hands, in a break with the party's tradition of collegial decision-making.\n\nAfter Trong's death was announced, public events were cancelled across the country until 25 July while state-run websites had their banners turned black and white.\n\nState broadcasters ran a documentary about Trong titled: \"General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong: a steadfast, intellectual, exemplary leader\".\n\nBars in the capital, Hanoi, declined to serve drinks or play music on Friday evening. Several Vietnamese Facebook users changed their profile picture into a national mourning flag.\n\nTrong was educated in the Soviet Union and was regarded as a Marxist-Leninist ideologue, but he nonetheless nurtured ties with the United States.\n\nIn 2017 he unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\", under which hundreds of officials were investigated for graft and many forced to quit, including Cabinet ministers, a Parliament chairman and two state presidents.\n\nThe operation had a chilling effect on investment.\n\nLam, a former chief of the powerful internal security agency, has been a key player in that campaign and was elected president in May after his predecessor resigned amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.\n\nChina's Communist Party also sent a message of condolence to Vietnam, calling him a \"staunch Marxist\" and \"a good comrade, brother and friend\", state media reported.", "source":

He was 80.\n\nHis death was announced by the official Nhan Dan newspaper, which said that Mr. Trong had died of \"old age\" and an unspecified serious illness.\n\nSpeculation had swirled in January about Mr. Trong's health after he skipped meetings with several foreign leaders. The seriousness of his illness became clear on Thursday, when the party announced that he would step back from his duties to focus on his health, and that President To Lam, a former security minister, would take over his responsibilities.\n\nFor 12 years, Mr. Trong sat at the apex of power in Vietnam's Communist hierarchy. He served an unprecedented three terms as party chief and nearly three decades in the Politburo. He consolidated power in one of the world's few remaining Communist dictatorships, significantly weakening the collective form of leadership that previously characterized the country's Communist Party.\n\nHis death left no obvious successor.\n\n\"He was the most powerful leader in Vietnam after the Vietnam War,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"I think anyone who will be chosen as the next leader of Vietnam will face an uphill battle in having the same kind of authority that Nguyen Phu Trong had.\"\n\nMr. Trong represented a conservative Marxist-Leninist faction within the party, which includes another faction seen as more pragmatic and moderate. His death is likely to raise hopes in the West that a less doctrinaire leader could emerge. Mr. Trong, the only one in the 18-member Politburo who grew up during the Vietnam War, was a generation older than many of his peers.\n\nHe was a conservative ideologue who viewed corruption as a threat to the party's survival, and in 2011 began a wide-reaching anticorruption campaign that has accelerated in recent years, investigating thousands of people and prompting the dismissal of several top ministers. The results have been mixed -- the campaign created a fairer business environment but has also instilled fear in many officials and paralyzed decision-making.\n\nMr. Trong also led the harshest crackdown on dissent in decades. Under his rule, the space for civil society -- never abundant in the nation of roughly 100 million people -- shrunk further.\n\nVietnam has the second-highest number of political prisoners in Southeast Asia, with more than 160 people currently detained for exercising their basic rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nAt home, Mr. Trong was viewed as a frugal leader who did not abuse his power to enrich himself or his family, unusual in Vietnam. His official vehicle was a two-decade-old Toyota Crown, according to a 2022 article in Vietnamnet, an online newspaper in Vietnam affiliated with the Ministry of Information and Communications. He refused to have new suits made.\n\nMr. Trong oversaw one of Asia's fastest-growing economies and raised Vietnam's prestige on the international stage, and under his term the world's major superpowers courted the Southeast Asian nation aggressively.\n\nMr. Trong was adept at balancing relations with the United States and China, a strategy he termed \"bamboo diplomacy.\" (\"Strong roots, stout trunk and flexible branches.\") He cultivated close ties with Xi Jinping, China's top leader, who visited Vietnam in December for the third time. Three months before that, President Biden had also been in Vietnam, cementing a new strategic relationship with Mr. Trong.\n\n\"He was a master of hedging,\" said Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies specializing in Vietnam.\n\nMr. Trong was born in Hanoi on April 4, 1944, into a farming family.\n\nAfter joining Vietnam's Communist Party, he traveled to the Soviet Union in 1981, where he earned a postgraduate history degree in 1983. From 1991 to 1996, he was editor in chief of the Communist Review, the mouthpiece of Vietnam's Communist Party.\n\nHe was never seen as a strong party chief candidate because he lacked extensive experience in government and economics. From January 2000 to June 2006, Mr. Trong was secretary of the party's Executive Committee of Hanoi, the provincial capital. From 2006 to 2011, he was chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly.\n\nVietnam's principle of leadership is a collective one, and unlike China it has long resisted having a supreme figure at the top. Mr. Trong's low-key manner made him a suitable compromise candidate for differing factions in the country's Communist Party, and at 68, he was not expected to have a long term. In 2011, he was elected general secretary.\n\nMr. Trong's first term was notable for a sharp rise in anti-China sentiment, after China moved an oil rig in contested waters near Vietnam's coast in 2014. It led to protests in Vietnam and sent relations between the two nations to the lowest level in three decades.\n\nMr. Vuving, the professor, said the event shifted Mr. Trong's view of the West. Few countries spoke up publicly then for Vietnam, except for two: Japan and the United States.\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Trong became the first Vietnamese Communist Party chief to travel to the United States. He met with President Obama and invited him to come to Vietnam. During his visit, Mr. Trong was asked about Vietnam's human rights situation.\n\nMr. Trong responded that \"Vietnamese people have never lived in a democratic atmosphere like today,\" but added that \"it is also important to see that individual rights must be placed in the context of the common interests of the community.\"\n\n\"The two sides' understandings are still different, so the best way, in my opinion, is to increase dialogue,\" he said. \"But we should not let human rights issues hinder our relations.\"\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Trong agreed that Vietnam would sign on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Obama's trade initiative, which would entail Vietnam changing its laws to legalize independent unions and allow workers to strike.\n\nIn that year, Mr. Trong was re-elected. In his second term, he stepped up his anti-corruption campaign, punishing several senior Politburo members.\n\nHe had been in poor health for years. In 2019, absent for an extended period, he skipped several state and party events. The government then said only that \"his health was affected by the weather and work intensity.\"\n\nAt the end of his term in 2021, he was expected to step down.\n\nBut the Communist Party gave him a third term, violating its own Constitution, which limits party chiefs to two terms.\n\nMr. Trong told reporters that he had not sought it, preferring to retire because of his health, but he had to \"comply\" because the Congress had elected him.\n\nWhile Mr. Trong was happy to open up Vietnam to the West, he remained suspicious of Western democracy.\n\n\"Behind the multiparty system in reality is still the tyranny of capitalist corporations,\" Mr. Trong wrote in a 2022 book.\n\nHe added: \"The reality is that the democratic institutions according to the 'liberal democracy' formula that the West tries to promote and impose on the world do not ensure that power truly belongs to the people, by the people and for the people,.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ngo Thi Man. The Vietnamese government does not disclose details about the children of party officials, but he is believed to also be survived by a son and a daughter.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType":

The media and civil organizations were also targeted.\n\nVietnam under Trong was known for \"bamboo diplomacy\" that shifted and bent as Vietnam navigated complex economic relationships with China and the United States as it also maintained connections with Russia and India.\n\nPresident Joe Biden met with General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong in an historic state visit in September 2023 that strengthened diplomatic and trade ties some five decades after what Biden called the \"bitter past\" of the Vietnam War.\n\nBiden signed a deal with Vietnam on semiconductors and rare earth minerals and said the relationship had a \"50-year arc of progress in the relationship between our nations from conflict to normalization.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department Vietnam \"is an authoritarian state ruled by a single party, the Communist Party of Vietnam.\"\n\nThe State Department cited the most significant human rights problems as severe restrictions on citizen's political rights, limited civil liberties and corruption in the judicial system and police.\n\nUnder Trong's leadership, Vietnam's GDP per capita more than doubled as Vietnam entered a series of free trade agreements both with the West and Asian nations.\n\n\"He always believed in making the party clean and relevant so that the party could live with the country for another 1,000 years -- that's his quote,\" said Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore Giang Nguyen in a statement to the BBC. \"So he saw the fate of the Vietnamese Communist party and the nation as bound together.\"",

He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nTrong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

who was seen as the most powerful figure in the country, has died, according to state media, ending more than 13 years of leadership after a reported illness.\n\nThe announcement on Friday came a day after the party announced that Trong would hand over power to focus on receiving medical treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.\n\nState media cited the government as saying that Trong died at a military hospital \"due to old age and serious illness\".\n\n\"There will be a special statement on the organisation of the funeral at the national level,\" according to the reports.\n\nHis death comes as the country goes through a political transition, with a new president appointed in May following the resignation of his predecessor.\n\nTo Lam took over from Vo Van Thuong, who resigned in March over what the party called \"violations and shortcomings\", after just a year in the job.\n\nTrong's responsibilities have been handed to the country's largely ceremonial president, Lam, a powerful former public security minister long seen as jockeying for the top job.\n\n\"The Politburo calls on the entire party, people and army to have absolute trust in the party's leadership and state management,\" it said on Thursday.\n\nThe communist administration, which is being completely overhauled, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.\n\nVietnam's leadership structure gives the party's general secretary the most powerful position.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trong's poor health prompted widespread speculation that he would not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.\n\nTrong enjoyed remarkable longevity in office since 2011, during a mandate that rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.\n\nKnown for being a technocrat and on good terms with China, he structured the party around himself, benefitting from a decade of economic growth that strengthened his legitimacy.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera

Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong died on July 19, 2024, aged 80 \"after a period of illness\", state media said. Nhac NGUYEN / AFP\n\nNguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful contemporary leader and architect of the country's largest anti-corruption campaign, died Friday at the age of 80, state media said.\n\nDuring Trong's 13 years as general secretary of the Communist Party, thousands of people were arrested on corruption charges and a crackdown on dissidents and activists intensified in the one-party state.\n\nTrong was president from 2018-21 and served three consecutive terms as general secretary, the first to do so since the \"doi moi\" era of economic reform began in 1986.\n\nThe unprecedented feat made him the most powerful leader in decades.\n\nTrong's high-profile anti-corruption drive, which analysts say was also linked to political in-fighting, swept through the party, police, armed forces and business.\n\nMore than 3,500 people have been indicted since 2021, official figures show, while those sent to prison include a former health minister and two previous mayors of Hanoi.\n\nFollowing a scandal related to the Covid-19 pandemic last year, President Nguyen Xuan Phuc resigned and two deputy prime ministers were removed from their positions.\n\nMany other prominent officials working across a wide range of sectors, from environment and energy to healthcare and banking, are under investigation.\n\nTrong would like to be remembered \"as a populist, someone very close to the people, who listens to the people\", said Linh Nguyen, lead analyst for Control Risks on Vietnam.\n\nBut the campaign has had unintended consequences. With many fearful of being caught in its crosshairs, everyday transactions within business and the state apparatus have slowed.\n\nAccording to Linh, \"the campaign is enervating the economy, something that we can clearly see in economic growth over the past two to three years\".\n\nVietnam's economy grew by around five percent in 2023, falling short of a government target of 6.50 percent.\n\nUnder Trong, rights groups say a crackdown on dissent has also been escalating since 2016, with the government largely succeeding in crushing opposition.\n\nVietnam currently holds more than 160 people in prison for peacefully exercising their basic civil and political rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe courts convicted at least 28 rights campaigners and sentenced them to long prison terms during the first 10 months of 2023, the group said.\n\nBorn in April 1944 into a farming family in the Hanoi suburbs, Trong studied literature and socialist theory before travelling to the Soviet Union to complete a doctorate degree in Communist Party building.\n\nHe began his career with a low-paid editing job at a magazine specialising in communist theory in Hanoi, before working his way up to editor-in-chief.\n\nIn 1994, he became a member of the party central committee -- his first nationally prominent political role -- and he was also head of the rubber-stamp national assembly before beginning his first term as party general secretary in 2011.\n\nHe stood out among Vietnam's top-ranking officials as a highly educated man.\n\nTrong oversaw the strengthening of the country's relationship with several international powers during his terms in office.\n\nIn 2023, US President Joe Biden paid a brief visit to Vietnam where the two former enemies announced upgrading bilateral ties to the highest level.\n\nTrong visited the United States in 2015 and made three trips to China. Most recently, in December 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping came to Hanoi, where the two pledged to deepen ties.\n\nVietnam has also become a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the world's most important companies over the past decade.\n\nBut many of them will be hoping a change in leadership means a halt to the anti-corruption campaign, said Linh, who told AFP that some complain of being badly affected by the disruption to business.\n\nHe said they will be thinking \"maybe after all the new figures and the top leadership settles down, we can go back and do business and keep investing in the country\".", "source": {"uri": "edition.mv", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Edition"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In 2017 he unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace,\" under which hundreds of officials were investigated for graft and many forced to quit, including cabinet ministers, a parliament chairman and two state presidents.\n\nLam, a former chief of the powerful internal security agency, has been a key player in that campaign and was elected president in May after his predecessor resigned amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party_Committee_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trong_(state_constituency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trong (state constituency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Ph\u00fa_Tr\u1ecdng", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u00f4_L\u00e2m", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "T\u00f4 L\u00e2m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\u2013Leninism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marxism\u2013Leninism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyanide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://wfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WFIN-AM-FM-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 79}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He died on Friday due to \"old age and serious illness\", state media reported, after ailing for months.\n\nHis death raises questions over succession at a crucial time for Vietnam, which has emerged as an alternative manufacturing hub to China amid efforts by companies across the world to reduce dependence on Beijing.\n\nTrong consolidated power into his hands during his tenure and weakened the other parts of Vietnam's four-pillar leadership system -- which includes not only his post as Communist party chief, but also the president, the prime minister and the chair of the National Assembly.\n\n\"Vietnam is potentially heading to a very uncertain period of leadership transition,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute. \"Any potential successor will struggle to fill the void left by Trong.\"\n\nHe said President To Lam, who was earlier this week made the interim party chief due to Trong's ill health, is the frontrunner, though infighting to succeed Trong would continue ahead of the party congress in 2026.\n\nLam holding two posts simultaneously would lead to more concerns over power consolidation, he said.\n\nTrong had become Vietnam's most influential leader since Ho Chi Minh.\n\nAs party chief from 2011 and the country's president between 2018 and 2021, he played a central role in Vietnam's economic rise. Vietnam has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment from companies across the world, becoming an important link in the supply chain for companies such as Apple and Samsung.\n\nTrong deftly balanced Hanoi's relationship with the global superpowers, maintaining close ties with the US, China and Russia. He forged ties with Vietnam's former foe, the US, by upgrading the relationship between the two countries to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" -- the highest level of diplomatic ties afforded by Hanoi.\n\nHe also drew criticism because during his leadership the Vietnamese government tightened control over news media, social media and civil society. In 2021, he was elected party chief for an unprecedented third term after the party decided to exempt him from the two-term rule.\n\nHis defining policy was an anti-corruption drive called \"blazing furnace\", in which thousands of government officials were disciplined and many prosecuted. Two presidents and two deputy prime ministers quit after being accused of violations, triggering political instability that has paralysed government activity and affected economic growth.\n\nIn April, real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was sentenced to death for her role in a $12bn fraud. Critics say the government's political opponents have also been targeted in the crackdown.\n\nPeter Mumford, south-east Asia head for Eurasia Group, said the anti-corruption campaign might ease off after Trong's death. \"The anti-corruption campaign may soften, in turn reducing the unintended side effect of bureaucratic paralysis that has created increasingly strong headwinds to economic growth in recent years.

He died \"due to old age and serious illness,\" the ruling Communist Party said on Friday.\n\nNguyen Phu Trong, the Marxist-Leninist who led Vietnam for more than a decade overseeing rapid economic growth and more recently trod a fine line in elevating ties with both China and the U.S. with his 'bamboo diplomacy', has died. He was 80.\n\nFor months Trong had appeared frail at public events or missed them outright and on Thursday his duties as party chief were taken over by President To Lam. He died \"due to old age and serious illness,\" the ruling Communist Party said on Friday.\n\nTrong became the Communist Party's general secretary in 2011, a position that in one-party authoritarian Vietnam gave him the key levers of power. He also served as Vietnam's president from 2018 to 2020.\n\nHe cultivated an image of moderation but from 2017 unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\" that in the past year has had a chilling effect on the economy and at times paralysed public administration.\n\nIn foreign policy, Trong advocated having \"more friends, fewer foes\" while being as flexible as bamboo.\n\nThat stance culminated in a visit by President Joe Biden to Hanoi last September that saw Vietnam lift the United States to its highest diplomatic status alongside China, Russia, India and South Korea.\n\nThree months later, ties with Beijing - a major Communist economic partner despite recurring tensions over territorial claims in the South China Sea - were further boosted when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited.\n\nVietnam also hosted Russia's President Vladimir Putin in June and elevated Japan to its highest level of diplomatic status last year.\n\nTrong's crackdown on corruption has been long and enduring - leading to arrests or forced resignations of senior officials.\n\n\"The furnace is heating up, even fresh firewood can be burnt,\" Trong said months after he launched his signature policy.\n\nCritics lambasted the clampdown as politically motivated and rights groups also accused Trong of presiding over an intensified muzzling of dissent that has seen activists, journalists and users of social media imprisoned. But he failed to uproot graft.\n\nIn late 2022, the country was shaken by its biggest financial fraud to date with the arrest of real-estate tycoon Truong My Lan and a run on deposits of the bank she controlled. Vietnam's central bank has had to embark on a massive rescue to avoid wider panic, costing more than $24 billion.\n\nTrong's crackdown led to the dismissal of two of Vietnam's presidents in about a year, the last one in March - developments that unnerved foreign investors who worried the anti-graft campaign had gotten out of hand.\n\nHammer and Sickle\n\nTrong's rule solidified in his second five-year term and despite his health issues, he secured a rare third term in 2021, with the party waiving a rule restricting the party chief position to two terms.\n\nAll in all, he held the party chief position for 13 years, second only to Le Duan, who ruled with an iron fist for 26 years after the death of Vietnam's founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.\n\nVietnam continued to flourish under Trong, benefiting from the 1986 \"Doi Moi\" reforms that transformed it from a war-torn agrarian nation into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.\n\nVietnam's annual GDP growth averaged 5.8% over the last decade and managed decent growth even during the coronavirus pandemic that crushed economies elsewhere.\n\nBorn and raised in the suburbs of Hanoi to a farmer couple, Trong was interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography. He majored in philology - the study of language and historical texts - at university and one of his first published works was a 1967 review of folk poetry.\n\nStudying for two years in the Soviet Union, he went on to gain a PhD in political science, writing his thesis on the Vietnam Communist Party's efforts to strengthen its connection with the masses. In 1991, he became editor-in-chief of the party's Communist Review magazine.\n\nTrong's image was that of a man who detested excess, lived in modest state-appointed housing and refused expensive Lunar New Year gifts from friends.\n\nTwo books - each some 600 pages long and published by the party in 2019 and 2021 respectively, extolled Trong's virtues - efforts that some critics likened to an attempt at building a cult of personality.\n\nA poem in the first book describes Trong as \"a noble man, sent by the spirits to purify the system,\" an apparent reference to the corruption crackdown. \"Hammer and sickle in hand, he dispels gloom, waiting for the sunshine,\" it said.\n\nTrong was married with a son and a daughter. His children, unlike those of other high-ranking officials, are normal public servants, government officials have said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered condolences to Vietnamese President To Lam over the passing of the country's Communist Party Secretary General Nguyen Phu Trong, according to the telegram published on the Kremlin's website.\n\n\"Nguyen Phu Trong's entire life was dedicated to serving his homeland. Throughout years of his tenure in senior positions in the government and the party, he earned enormous respect among his fellow country people and a remarkable reputation in the international arena. In Russia, he will always be remembered as a true friend of our country, who made a huge personal contribution to the establishment and development of a comprehensive strategic partnership between Moscow and Hanoi,\" the telegram reads.\n\nPutin met with Nguyen Phu Trong in June during his visit to Vietnam, and they held talks. Putin then invited Vietnamese leaders, including the Communist Party chief, to visit Russia at any convenient time.\n\nNguyen Phu Trong passed away at the age of 80 following a period of illness. He was born in Hanoi's Dong Anh suburban area on April 14, 1944. He graduated from Hanoi State University's Philology Department and earned a PhD in Philology. Later, he grew into a professor, earning a doctorate degree in political science when studying at the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow in 1981-1983. Nguyen Phu Trong did the Russian language and literature.\n\nBefore being elected Secretary General of the Central Committee of Vietnam's Communist Party for the first time in 2011, Nguyen Phu Trong was speaker of the National Assembly (parliament) for five years and before that he had held some senior positions in the country's party. He was elected secretary general of the Communist Party three times - in 2011, 2016 and 2021. Between October 2018 and January 2021, Nguyen Phu Trong served also as Vietnam's president following the passing of President Tran Dai Quang, who was to be in office from 2016 to 2021.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Ph\u00fa_Tr\u1ecdng", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party_Committee_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u00f4_L\u00e2m", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T\u00f4 L\u00e2m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Vietnam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr\u1ea7n_\u0110\u1ea1i_Quang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Quang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Vietnam", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 100}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-04-", "textStart": 1187, "textEnd": 1195}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1957, "textEnd": 1969}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

In recent months three top leaders quit following unspecified accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to an official statement released on Friday, Mr Trong died \"due to old age and serious illness\".\n\nIt comes a day after the Vietnamese government said in a surprise announcement that Mr Trong needed time to \"focus on active treatment\" for an unspecified medical condition. It added that the president would take over Mr Trong's duties in running the party's central committee, politburo and secretariat.\n\nOn that same day, the government also awarded Mr Trong the Gold Star, the highest honour given in Vietnam, for contributions to the party and country.\n\nMr Trong was seen as recently as late June, when he welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin on a state visit.\n\nBut after that he failed to attend several events, including the official launch of a book compiling some of his speeches.\n\nIn recent years, there were several instances where he would disappear from the public eye for long stretches of time. In 2019, he was reported to have had a stroke.\n\nLittle would be said about these absences by the state, though Mr Trong occasionally acknowledged he had health and ageing issues. Observers say the state's discretion over the health of party leaders and government officials is one way of portraying Vietnam as a stable nation under single-party rule.\n\nIn 2018, the country passed a law classifying top officials' health as a state secret, prompting the already tightly-controlled local media to be even more cautious. Intense speculation over his health has long thrived on social media.\n\nObservers say he leaves behind a deep but incomplete legacy. After rising to power in 2011 he stayed on as general secretary for a rare three terms. During this period he also acted as president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nHe saw the need to open up Vietnam's economy - under his watch, the country's GDP per capita more than doubled and Vietnam inked a series of free trade agreements with the West and Asian neighbours. Mr Trong was seen as more keen to engage the world than his predecessors, building relationships with US leaders as well as Mr Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAt the same time, he fervently clung on to his socialist ideals. \"He was a career lifelong ideologue... he was a true believer, and I think that's why in some ways relations between Vietnam and China have grown so close,\" said Zachary M Abuza, a professor and Southeast Asia expert with the National War College in Washington DC.\n\n\"He always believed in making the party clean and relevant so that the party could live with the country for another 1,000 years - that's his quote. So he saw the fate of the Vietnamese Communist party and the nation as bound together,\" said Giang Nguyen, a visiting senior fellow with the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore and former BBC Vietnamese editor.\n\nMr Trong launched his \"blazing furnaces\" campaign to root out corruption that deepened in tandem with Vietnam's growth. Close to 200,000 officials are estimated to have been criminally charged or to have faced disciplinary action since then.\n\nBut there are few signs it has truly succeeded in stamping out the problem. The country still performs dismally in international corruption rankings. In recent months Vietnam has been rocked by one of its biggest fraud scandals ever, involving a staggering $44bn (\u00a334bn) filched from banks.\n\nThe anti-corruption drive has been seen as sparking a critical shortage in the public service sector. It's also been seen as contributing to instability within the Communist Party, where so many top officials have been purged - due to corruption or infighting - that very few are left as possible successors, particularly in the paramount political leadership team, the Politburo. Only two currently meet the conditions to inherit his post: Mr Lam and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.\n\n\"The talent pool hasn't been prepared by Mr Trong. It shows he couldn't control the forces within the party anymore,\" said Mr Nguyen.\n\nDr Abuza pointed out that the anti-corruption drive in many ways \"served to delegitimise the party in ways that [Trong] didn't expect, because it exposed just how sweeping corruption is at the highest level of the party\".\n\nDuring his rule Vietnam also continued to tighten its control on human rights and freedom of speech. It has jailed or deported scores of dissidents, activists and bloggers, and passed draconian laws limiting the press and internet.\n\nHis death, and the question of succession that it poses, puts Vietnam in uncharted waters. For many Vietnamese, \"we share the feeling of anxiety of the unknown\", said Mr Nguyen.\n\n\"It is the end of an era. That version of communism or socialism, the old times, it's now gone. What's next is going to be very difficult to foresee. The system is still there, but without that veneer of ideology and ideals.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 80.\n\n\"General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13.38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,\" the Nhan Dan newspaper said.\n\nMr Trong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system.\n\nIn the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more towards the governmental wing led by then-prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Mr Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Mr Trong said in 2016 after being re-elected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that hit both business and political elites.\n\nSince 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared with none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nMr Trong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China.\n\nHowever, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy\", a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbour, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.", "source": {"uri":

Party officials on Thursday said he was relinquishing his responsibilities to focus on his treatment. Trong's departure leaves a power vacuum and opens a rare window of political uncertainty in Vietnam, one of the world's few remaining communist dictatorships that typically orchestrates its transitions of power.\n\nTo Lam, Vietnam's longtime minister of public security who was recently installed as president, is seen as a likely candidate to replace Trong as party secretary, the most influential position in the Vietnamese system. On Thursday, leaders of the Politburo announced that Lam would temporarily take over Trong's duties.\n\n\"The Politburo calls on the entire Party, the entire people and the entire army to have absolute confidence in the leadership of the Party,\" the Politburo said in an announcement printed across state-owned news agencies.\n\nTrong presided over Vietnam during a period of dramatic transformation. Widely regarded as a party hard-liner, he opened the country up to more investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries while tightening the party's grip over domestic instability and criticism.\n\nHere's what to know about Trong's legacy and what his departure means for Vietnam, an increasingly vital swing state in the competition among the United States, Russia and China.\n\nWhy was Trong seen as Vietnam's top leader?\n\nVietnam's top leadership consists of four people who govern by consensus - the general secretary of the Communist Party, the president, the prime minister and the chairman of the National Assembly. But the party secretary is widely regarded as preeminent.\n\nWhen President Biden visited Hanoi last September to upgrade relations between the United States and Vietnam, he had a one-on-one meeting with Trong, a rare engagement for Biden with a foreign leader who is not a head of state or government.\n\nWhat were Trong's priorities while in power?\n\nTrong was educated in the former Soviet Union and ascended to the party's top position in 2011. He was reelected in 2016, and in 2021 began serving an unprecedented third term as party secretary.\n\nVietnam experienced a window of political liberalization in the early 2000s, but this was largely reversed under Trong's tenure, analysts say. The party under Trong consolidated and expanded its powers, including by pressuring big tech companies such as Meta to scrub criticism of party leaders from its platforms, implementing legislation to curb free speech and arresting droves of political opponents and critics. According to the 88 Project, a watchdog group focused on Vietnam, the government has imprisoned nearly 200 people for political reasons, including environmental activists, journalists and trade unionists.\n\nIn recent years, Trong became identified with his signature anti-graft effort, which led to the resignation of high-ranking party officials, including two state presidents, multiple provincial leaders and several dozen other members of the party's Central Committee. The campaign, called a \"blazing furnace\" in Vietnamese, gave rise to an unusual period of political instability in the country.\n\nThe campaign \"was meant to repair the system but in fact has exposed the cancer of corruption and political decay of the regime,\" said Nguyen Thanh Giang, a Vietnamese analyst at the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\nHow did U.S.-Vietnam relations evolve under Trong?\n\nVietnam under Trong developed warmer relations with its former foe, the United States. Washington has sought a closer security relationship with Vietnam to serve as a bulwark against China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. Under pressure to diversify supply chains away from China, U.S. companies have also increasingly turned to Vietnam as a nearby alternative.\n\nVietnam, on its part, has sought to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing, especially in the face of increased Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, which is claimed in part by Vietnam.\n\nBut Vietnam has also maintained strong relations with China and Russia. Trong received both Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hanoi in recent months.\n\nWhat does his departure mean for Vietnam?\n\nTrong's stepping back from party leadership creates a power vacuum within the party that could exacerbate infighting that has already taken hold because of the anti-corruption investigations, analysts suggest.\n\nMany expect Lam to emerge as Trong's eventual successor. Formerly the country's top cop, Lam was elevated to the role of president in May, replacing two others who were ousted in quick succession. Human rights groups blame Lam for Vietnam's crackdown on civil society and fear that his ascent could lead to more arrests of civil society leaders.\n\n\"Over the coming years, we can expect that the brutal repression Lam meted out as top cop will intensify,\" said Ben Swanton, co-director of the 88 Project.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

The seriousness of his illness became clear on Thursday, when the party announced that he would step back from his duties to focus on his health, and that President To Lam, a former security minister, would take over his responsibilities.\n\nFor 12 years, Mr. Trong sat at the apex of power in Vietnam's Communist hierarchy.

He is an ideologue who views corruption as the gravest threat facing the party.\n\nHowever, at age 80, Trong's health has been of growing concern. He suffered a stroke in April 2019 and has often appeared frail and unwell in his public appearances since. In January 2024, Trong failed to meet with successive high-level visitors, Laos' prime minister and Indonesia's president, again sparking rumors that he had suffered a health crisis.\n\nThe CPV statement finally confirmed Trong's ill health, which had long been rumored, but didn't give any further details.\n\nThe party's powerful Politburo has now asked Lam to \"preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,\" according to a statement from the party's central office.\n\nLam is widely viewed as the top candidate to replace Trong when the latter's term ends in 2026. He spent over four decades in the Ministry of Public Security before becoming the minister in 2016 and had been a key figure in the execution of anti-corruption measures.\n\nAs Vietnam's top security official, Lam led Trong's sweeping anti-graft campaign until May, when he became president following the resignation of his predecessor, who stood down after being caught by the campaign.\n\nLam's ascension to the presidency, and now to the top of the CPV, at least in an interim capacity, comes amid an era of uncertainty and turmoil for Vietnamese politics. In March, Vo Van Thuong resigned as president; a month later, Vuong Dinh Hue, the chairperson of the National Assembly, followed suit. Both departed over unspecified \"violations\" of party discipline, presumably involvement in corruption cases.\n\nAs The Diplomat's Sebastian Strangio wrote at the time, the resignations \"left two of the country's 'four pillars' - its four most powerful political posts - vacant... The [anti-corruption] campaign has also left empty five of the 18 seats on the Politburo, the CPV's apex decision-making body.\"\n\nNotably, Thuong had only held the presidency for a little over a year before being forced out. His predecessor, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, also resigned after being implicated in a corruption case.\n\nLam, as minister of public security, was a key figure in the anti-corruption campaign that has conveniently sidelined his rivals in the race to replace Trong at the next CPV National Congress in early 2026. Now Lam is assuming the top post earlier than expected - and perhaps for good. While the CPV was tight-lipped on the exact state of Trong's health, and whether he might resume his duties, rumors in Vietnam suggest his death might be imminent.\n\nThe formal announcement of Lam as interim leader seems to lock up his quest to succeed Trong and could potentially bring an end to Vietnam's rare period of political instability. The cost, however, will be a newly dominant role for Lam's security-focused peers in Vietnam's political landscape, which has traditionally balanced power between different portfolios.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trong_(state_constituency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trong (state constituency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u00f4_L\u00e2m", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T\u00f4 L\u00e2m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Vietnam", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Ph\u00fa_Tr\u1ecdng", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_V\u0103n_Th\u01b0\u1edfng", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 V\u0103n Th\u01b0\u1edfng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Public_Security_(China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Public Security (China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Unity Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u01b0\u01a1ng_\u0110\u00ecnh_Hu\u1ec7", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0110\u00ecnh Hu\u1ec7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Xu\u00e2n_Ph\u00fac", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Xu\u00e2n Ph\u00fac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_discipline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party discipline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2024-05-22-152310.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 599, "textEnd": 609}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He was 80.\n\nHe died in the early afternoon \"due to old age and serious illness\", the Communist Party said in a statement on its website, without elaborating further on the nature of the illness.\n\nThe statement cited information from Trong's medical team, saying he died \"after a period of illness, despite being wholeheartedly treated by the Party, the State, a collective of professors, doctors, leading medical experts\".\n\nThe country's president, To Lam, had taken over Trong's duties on Thursday when the party announced the ageing leader needed to focus on medical treatment.\n\nThe party will need to decide whether Lam will continue as acting party general secretary until the current term for the post expires after the next Congress in 2026, or whether it will elect a new candidate before then from within its ranks.\n\nAlthough Vietnam officially has no paramount ruler, Trong was the country's most powerful figure as party general secretary and had been in the post since 2011.\n\nHe secured a third term in 2021 after a rule limiting holders to two terms as party boss was waived, demonstrating his strength and significant political clout in a party that has ruled Vietnam for nearly half a century.\n\nBut in recent months, he appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings.\n\nTrong was educated in the Soviet Union and was regarded as a Marxist-Leninist ideologue. In 2017 he unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\", under which hundreds of officials were investigated for graft and many forced to quit, including cabinet ministers, a parliament chairman and two state presidents.\n\nLam, a former chief of the powerful internal security agency, has been a key player in that campaign and was elected president in May after his predecessor resigned amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing.

He was 80.\n\nFor months Trong had appeared frail at public events or missed them outright and on Thursday his duties as party chief were taken over by President To Lam. He died \"due to old age and serious illness,\" the ruling Communist Party said on Friday.\n\nTrong became the Communist Party's general secretary in 2011, a position that in one-party authoritarian Vietnam gave him the key levers of power. He also served as Vietnam's president from 2018 to 2020.\n\nHe cultivated an image of moderation but from 2017 unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\" that in the past year has had a chilling effect on the economy and at times paralysed public administration.\n\nIn foreign policy, Trong advocated having \"more friends, fewer foes\" while being as flexible as bamboo.\n\nThat stance culminated in a visit by President Joe Biden to Hanoi last September that saw Vietnam lift the United States to its highest diplomatic status alongside China, Russia, India and South Korea.\n\nThree months later, ties with Beijing - a major Communist economic partner despite recurring tensions over territorial claims in the South China Sea - were further boosted when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited.\n\nVietnam also hosted Russia's President Vladimir Putin in June and elevated Japan to its highest level of diplomatic status last year.\n\nTrong's crackdown on corruption has been long and enduring - leading to arrests or forced resignations of senior officials.\n\n\"The furnace is heating up, even fresh firewood can be burnt,\" Trong said months after he launched his signature policy.\n\nCritics lambasted the clampdown as politically motivated and rights groups also accused Trong of presiding over an intensified muzzling of dissent that has seen activists, journalists and users of social media imprisoned.\n\nBut he failed to uproot graft.\n\nIn late 2022, the country was shaken by its biggest financial fraud to date with the arrest of real-estate tycoon Truong My Lan and a run on deposits of the bank she controlled. Vietnam's central bank has had to embark on a massive rescue to avoid wider panic, costing more than $24 billion.\n\nTrong's crackdown led to the dismissal of two of Vietnam's presidents in about a year, the last one in March - developments that unnerved foreign investors who worried the anti-graft campaign had gotten out of hand.\n\nHAMMER AND SICKLE\n\nTrong's rule solidified in his second five-year term and despite his health issues, he secured a rare third term in 2021, with the party waiving a rule restricting the party chief position to two terms.\n\nAll in all, he held the party chief position for 13 years, second only to Le Duan, who ruled with an iron fist for 26 years after the death of Vietnam's founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.\n\nVietnam continued to flourish under Trong, benefiting from the 1986 \"Doi Moi\" reforms that transformed it from a war-torn agrarian nation into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.\n\nVietnam's annual GDP growth averaged 5.8% over the last decade and managed decent growth even during the coronavirus pandemic that crushed economies elsewhere.\n\nBorn and raised in the suburbs of Hanoi to a farmer couple, Trong was interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography. He majored in philology - the study of language and historical texts - at university and one of his first published works was a 1967 review of folk poetry.\n\nStudying for two years in the Soviet Union, he went on to gain a PhD in political science, writing his thesis on the Vietnam Communist Party's efforts to strengthen its connection with the masses. In 1991, he became editor-in-chief of the party's Communist Review magazine.\n\nTrong's image was that of a man who detested excess, lived in modest state-appointed housing and refused expensive Lunar New Year gifts from friends.\n\nTwo books - each some 600 pages long and published by the party in 2019 and 2021 respectively, extolled Trong's virtues - efforts that some critics likened to an attempt at building a cult of personality.\n\nA poem in the first book describes Trong as \"a noble man, sent by the spirits to purify the system,\" an apparent reference to the corruption crackdown. \"Hammer and sickle in hand, he dispels gloom, waiting for the sunshine,\" it said.\n\nTrong was married with a son and a daughter. His children, unlike those of other high-ranking officials, are normal public servants, government officials have said.\n\n(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen, Francesco Guarascio, Khanh Vu and James Pearson;

He was 80.\n\nFor months Trong had appeared frail at public events or missed them outright and on Thursday his duties as party chief were taken over by President To Lam. He died \"due to old age and serious illness,\" the ruling Communist Party said on Friday.\n\nTrong became the Communist Party's general secretary in 2011, a position that in one-party authoritarian Vietnam gave him the key levers of power. He also served as Vietnam's president from 2018 to 2020.\n\nHe cultivated an image of moderation but from 2017 unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\" that in the past year has had a chilling effect on the economy and at times paralysed public administration.\n\nIn foreign policy, Trong advocated having \"more friends, fewer foes\" while being as flexible as bamboo.\n\nThat stance culminated in a visit by President Joe Biden to Hanoi last September that saw Vietnam lift the United States to its highest diplomatic status alongside China, Russia, India and South Korea.\n\nThree months later, ties with Beijing - a major Communist economic partner despite recurring tensions over territorial claims in the South China Sea - were further boosted when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited.\n\nVietnam also hosted Russia's President Vladimir Putin in June and elevated Japan to its highest level of diplomatic status last year.\n\nTrong's crackdown on corruption has been long and enduring - leading to arrests or forced resignations of senior officials.\n\n\"The furnace is heating up, even fresh firewood can be burnt,\" Trong said months after he launched his signature policy.\n\nCritics lambasted the clampdown as politically motivated and rights groups also accused Trong of presiding over an intensified muzzling of dissent that has seen activists, journalists and users of social media imprisoned.\n\nBut he failed to uproot graft.\n\nIn late 2022, the country was shaken by its biggest financial fraud to date with the arrest of real-estate tycoon Truong My Lan and a run on deposits of the bank she controlled. Vietnam's central bank has had to embark on a massive rescue to avoid wider panic, costing more than $24 billion.\n\nTrong's crackdown led to the dismissal of two of Vietnam's presidents in about a year, the last one in March - developments that unnerved foreign investors who worried the anti-graft campaign had gotten out of hand.\n\nHAMMER AND SICKLE\n\nTrong's rule solidified in his second five-year term and despite his health issues, he secured a rare third term in 2021, with the party waiving a rule restricting the party chief position to two terms.\n\nAll in all, he held the party chief position for 13 years, second only to Le Duan, who ruled with an iron fist for 26 years after the death of Vietnam's founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.\n\nVietnam continued to flourish under Trong, benefiting from the 1986 \"Doi Moi\" reforms that transformed it from a war-torn agrarian nation into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.\n\nVietnam's annual GDP growth averaged 5.8% over the last decade and managed decent growth even during the coronavirus pandemic that crushed economies elsewhere.\n\nBorn and raised in the suburbs of Hanoi to a farmer couple, Trong was interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography. He majored in philology - the study of language and historical texts - at university and one of his first published works was a 1967 review of folk poetry.\n\nStudying for two years in the Soviet Union, he went on to gain a PhD in political science, writing his thesis on the Vietnam Communist Party's efforts to strengthen its connection with the masses. In 1991, he became editor-in-chief of the party's Communist Review magazine.\n\nTrong's image was that of a man who detested excess, lived in modest state-appointed housing and refused expensive Lunar New Year gifts from friends.\n\nTwo books - each some 600 pages long and published by the party in 2019 and 2021 respectively, extolled Trong's virtues - efforts that some critics likened to an attempt at building a cult of personality.\n\nA poem in the first book describes Trong as \"a noble man, sent by the spirits to purify the system,\" an apparent reference to the corruption crackdown. \"Hammer and sickle in hand, he dispels gloom, waiting for the sunshine,\" it said.\n\nTrong was married with a son and a daughter. His children, unlike those of other high-ranking officials, are normal public servants, government officials have said.\n\n(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen, Francesco Guarascio, Khanh Vu and James Pearson;

He was 80.\n\nThe cause was \"severe illness,\" according to a statement by the Professional Council for Health Protection of Central Officials carried by state media. On July 18, Mr. Trong stepped back from his powerful position as general secretary of the Communist Party, citing poor health. Vietnam's president, To Lam, took over in a caretaker role.\n\nOn the world stage, Mr. Trong was seen as an artful practitioner of Vietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\" -- called so for bending in different directions -- as the country navigated ties with its most important economic partners, China and the United States, while also building bonds with nations such as India and Russia.\n\nHis hold within Vietnam was less finessed. His anti-corruption drive attempted to burnish public trust in the Communist Party and its stewardship of Vietnam's economy, one of the most dynamic in the region, with sectors that include a growing start-up culture.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trong tightened the state's grip on other freedoms. He oversaw hard-line Communist Party directives aimed at the media, civil society groups and internal political challenges.\n\nIn May, police arrested Nguyen Van Binh, an official in the Labor Ministry who had advocated for independent trade unions. He was charged with disclosing state secrets during talks with U.N. envoys, but many rights activists interpreted the prosecution as punishment for his reformist views.\n\nSince the Vietnam War era, the country's political leadership (then North Vietnam) developed as a collective system among the Communist Party general secretary, the president, prime minister and the top-ranking member of the National Assembly. Mr. Trong asserted his influence in ways rarely seen.\n\nHe was elected as the party's general secretary in 2011 and reelected five years later. After the death of President Tran Dai Quang in 2018, Mr. Trong took on the presidency as well -- making him head of the party and state. Only a few others, including North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, held both titles at once.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Trong left the presidency but was reelected by the party as general secretary for a third term, the first leader in more than three decades to serve more than two terms. After the vote by party members, the 76-year-old Mr. Trong said he was \"not in great health\" and preferred to rest but would honor the decision to have him remain party head.\n\nWhen Mr. Trong hosted President Biden in Hanoi last September, the White House carefully calibrated its talks. Both nations value their economic links -- the United States is Vietnam's top export market -- and U.S. policymakers regard Vietnam as an important regional buffer against Chinese power in Southeast Asia.\n\nAmid the outreach, however, Biden called attention to Mr. Trong's strongman style. \"I also raised the importance of respect for human rights as a priority for both my administration and the American people,\" Biden told journalists. \"And we'll continue ... our candid dialogue on that regard.\"\n\nHuman rights advocates and others have been more outspoken. Project 88, a watchdog group that monitors Vietnam, portrayed Mr. Trong as presiding over a \"police state [that] has imprisoned scores of human rights activists and dissenters, while shutting down the only independent journalists' association\" in a country of nearly 100 million people.\n\nProject 88 estimated nearly 200 people had been jailed for political reasons under Mr. Trong's rule, including environmental activists, journalists and trade unionists. Mr. Trong's one-party state also successfully pressured tech companies such as Meta to scrub criticism of party leaders from its platforms.\n\nStill, for many in Vietnam, Mr. Trong's gains in foreign policy and the anti-corruption campaigns are viewed with favor as the centerpieces of his legacy, said Khang Vu, a scholar of Vietnamese affairs at Boston College.\n\n\"You cannot deny that there were political motivations behind some of the corruption cases as a way to keep the party in line and Trong in control,\" he said in an interview. \"Yet it's also clear that many officials and businesspeople act with far more caution now, knowing that there can be consequences.\"\n\nThe corruption-hunting began after Mr. Trong started his second term as party leader in 2016. Within four years, more than 100 Communist Party members, including some top Politburo figures, had been disciplined or criminally charged on counts of graft, illegal business deals and other misdeeds.\n\nIn a speech, Mr. Trong compared the purges to a \"burning furnace,\" which was adopted as the name of the anti-corruption drive. Probes touched military officers, banking magnates and highly placed political figures.\n\nThe information minister, Truong Minh Tuan, was fired in 2018 and sentenced to 14 years in prison for behind-the-scenes dealmaking in the purchase of a television station. His predecessor, Nguyen Bac Son, received a life sentence in 2019 for receiving an estimated $3 million in kickbacks.\n\nOne case reached as high as the president's office.\n\nTop deputies of President Nguyen Xuan Phuc were placed under criminal investigation for alleged power abuse during the pandemic, including claims they took bribes for seats aboard chartered flights to repatriate Vietnamese citizens stranded abroad during lockdowns.\n\nPhuc was ordered by the Communist Party to resign in January 2023 and was replaced by Mr. Trong's ally, Vo Van Thuong. Thuong resigned a year later following a terse Communist Party statement saying he \"had shortcomings which affected public opinion and the reputation of the party, state and himself.\"\n\nIn another inquest backed by Mr. Trong, the chief executive of a health-care company, Viet A, acknowledged bribing officials for contracts to sell substandard coronavirus test kits to hospitals. The scandal led to the arrests in June 2022 of the health minister and a former government minister of science and technology.\n\nZachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, described the corruption-fighting as a way for Mr. Trong to consolidate power and quash other centers of influences.\n\n\"This is bare knuckled politics, as elites seek to consolidate their wealth and power,\" Abuza wrote in a commentary for Radio Free Asia. \"The days of collective leadership are gone.\"\n\nNguyen Phu Trong was born in a rural district outside Hanoi on April 14, 1944. His official state biography described his early years as those of a \"poor peasant.\"\n\nIn 1967, he received a degree in linguistics from Vietnam National University in Hanoi and then applied for membership in the Communist Party. He was accepted into the party in 1968 as the Vietnam War was escalating.\n\nHe served in various roles involving enforcement and interpretation of Communist Party doctrine over the next three decades, including editor of a top party mouthpiece, the Communist Review, from 1991 to 1996. Earlier, he had been sent to study in Moscow, receiving a doctorate in history from the Academy of Sciences in 1983.\n\nHe was groomed for leadership after becoming part of the Politburo in 1997 and served as chairman of the National Assembly from 2006 to 2011.\n\nSoon after being named party general secretary, he made a visit to China that included talks with President Hu Jintao. Mr. Trong attempted to avoid friction with Beijing while also noting his efforts to strengthen ties with the United States. Mr. Trong urged dialogue over the South China Sea, which Beijing claims as its territory but is seen by Washington as part of China's efforts to expand its military reach in the region.\n\nThen, in the span of four months in 2015, Mr. Trong made officials visits to China and the United States, where he met with President Barack Obama in talks that included greater economic cooperation.\n\nMr. Trong struck a tone of realpolitik in an address to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, saying he recognized the interpretations of political freedoms and expression differed between the two countries. \"But we should not let human rights issues hinder the relationship between the two countries,\" he said.\n\nIn a further diplomatic straddle between East and West, Mr. Trong hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in June in a show of Vietnam's efforts to strike a neutral position on the war in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trong was married to Ngo Thi Man, and they had two children. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nNguyen Thanh Giang, a Vietnamese analyst at the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute think tank, said Mr. Trong's zeal to fight corruption also forced a hard look at Vietnam under one-party rule.\n\nThe campaign \"was meant to repair the system,\" Giang said, \"but in fact has exposed the cancer of corruption and political decay of the regime.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_murphy@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Brian

With many fearful of being caught in its crosshairs, everyday transactions within business and the state apparatus have slowed.\n\nAccording to Linh, \"the campaign is enervating the economy, something that we can clearly see in economic growth over the past two to three years\".\n\nVietnam's economy grew by around five percent in 2023, falling short of a government target of 6.50 percent.\n\nUnder Trong, rights groups say a crackdown on dissent has also been escalating since 2016, with the government largely succeeding in crushing opposition.\n\nVietnam currently holds more than 160 people in prison for peacefully exercising their basic civil and political rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe courts convicted at least 28 rights campaigners and sentenced them to long prison terms during the first 10 months of 2023, the group said.\n\n- International relations -\n\nBorn in April 1944 into a farming family in the Hanoi suburbs, Trong studied literature and socialist theory before travelling to the Soviet Union to complete a doctorate degree in Communist Party building.\n\nHe began his career with a low-paid editing job at a magazine specialising in communist theory in Hanoi, before working his way up to editor-in-chief.\n\nIn 1994, he became a member of the party central committee -- his first nationally prominent political role -- and he was also head of the rubber-stamp national assembly before beginning his first term as party general secretary in 2011.\n\nHe stood out among Vietnam's top-ranking officials as a highly educated man.\n\nTrong oversaw the strengthening of the country's relationship with several international powers during his terms in office.\n\nIn 2023, US President Joe Biden paid a brief visit to Vietnam where the two former enemies announced upgrading bilateral ties to the highest level.\n\nTrong visited the United States in 2015 and made three trips to China. Most recently, in December 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping came to Hanoi, where the two pledged to deepen ties.\n\nVietnam has also become a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the world's most important companies over the past decade.\n\nBut many of them will be hoping a change in leadership means a halt to the anti-corruption campaign, said Linh, who told AFP that some complain of being badly affected by the disruption to business.\n\nHe said they will be thinking \"maybe after all the new figures and the top leadership settles down, we can go back and do business and keep investing in the country\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As acting general secretary, he is now Vietnam's top leader and will oversee the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo and the Secretariat, according to the Vietnam News Agency.\n\nHe's now in position to direct preparations for the Communist Party's 14th National Congress, scheduled for January 2026, according to Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.\n\nAfter several years of high-level political infighting - and some noteworthy resignations - his leadership could provide some stability for the next 17 months, Abuza said\n\n\"He will be in a very strong position to become general secretary at the 14th Congress, though he would require an age waiver,\" he said.\n\n\"But we have to consider that the Central Committee, which is much more powerful than in China, could want to clean the field, and elect a vastly new politburo and general secretary.\"\n\n'Breathing space'\n\nIn his previous role as minister of public security, Lam played a leading role in a sweeping anti-corruption campaign, seen by critics as a political tool for factions in the Communist Party to eliminate competitors.\n\nIn 2021, after laying a wreath at the grave of Karl Marx while on a trip to London, he was filmed eating $2,000 gold-encrusted steaks at a restaurant. Lam has gone after people who publicly mocked him with a vengeance.\n\nTrong, who also served as president from October 2018 to April 2021, was chosen to serve a rule-breaking third five-year term as party secretary in 2021. His term will expire in 2026 when the 14th Congress meets, and he could recommend a successor.\n\nLam and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, 65, are the only two candidates eligible to succeed him.\n\nThe decision to hand over Trong's secretary general duties to a caretaker was \"prudent\" and was being handled under normal Politburo regulations, according to Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\n\"There will be no major disruption in domestic and foreign policies,\" he said.\n\n\"It provides a breathing space of nearly 18 months to prepare for the 14th national party congress,\" Thayer said. \"This is plenty of time for an orderly process of consensus-building on the new leadership.\"\n\nRumors of ill health\n\nTrong, 80, is receiving treatment for an unspecified medical condition, VNExpress reported on Thursday.\n\nHe was seen in public on June 20 when he received Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hanoi.\n\n\"The Politburo, the Secretariat, key leaders and the Standing Member of the Secretariat have directed specialized agencies to focus on mobilizing a team of professors, doctors, medical staff, leading experts and the most favorable conditions to treat and care for the general secretary's health,\" it said.\n\nSpeculation about Trong's health on social media was sparked at the end of last year when he disappeared from the public eye after meeting Japanese Communist Party head Kazuo Shii in Hanoi on Dec. 26.\n\nThe following month, he failed to meet Lao Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone and then-Indonesian President Joko Widodo on their official visits to Vietnam.\n\nA brief appearance at the start of an extraordinary session of the National Assembly on Jan. 15 failed to assuage rumors of ill health.\n\nSince then, there has been a major shakeup of the upper echelons of Vietnam's Communist Party. Vo Van Thuong resigned as president in March and Vuong Dinh Hue stepped down as chairman of the National Assembly in May.\n\nOn May 20, Tran Thanh Man took office as National Assembly chairman with parliament swearing in To Lam as state president two days later.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He was 80. He was a name that resonates deeply within the fabric of modern Vietnam. Trong was a prominent figure in Vietnamese politics, serving as the General Secretary of the CPV since 2011.\n\nFor twelve years, Trong held the highest position of authority within Vietnam's Communist hierarchy. Serving an unprecedented three terms as General Secretary and nearly thirty years on the Politburo, he consolidated power in one of the world's last remaining Communist regimes, diminishing the previously collective leadership structure that defined the country's Communist Party.\n\nBorn on April 14, 1944, in Hanoi, was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy. Trong's political career began in the 1960s when he joined the CPV. He quickly rose through the ranks, demonstrating a strong commitment to the party's ideological foundations and governance.\n\nThroughout his career, Trong has held several important positions, including head of the Party's Organization Commission and the Chairman of the National Assembly. His leadership was marked by a focus on anti-corruption measures, economic reforms, and strengthening Vietnam's international relations. Under his guidance, the CPV emphasised the importance of maintaining a socialist orientation while adapting to global economic changes, a policy known as \"Doi Moi,\" which translates to \"Renovation.\"\n\nTrong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, leading to speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam might move closer to Russia and China.\n\nHowever, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy,\" a phrase he coined referring to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nIn addition to his political and diplomatic work, Trong was a key figure in the CPV's ideological education, emphasising Marxist-Leninist principles while encouraging pragmatic approaches to governance. His leadership style was characterised by a blend of firmness in principle and flexibility in tactics, allowing Vietnam to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes effectively.\n\nTrong viewed corruption as the single gravest threat to maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that targeted both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined, including former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong, and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In total, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nDespite facing challenges, including economic pressures and regional tensions, Trong remained a steadfast advocate for Vietnam's sovereignty and development. His leadership was instrumental in positioning Vietnam as a rising power in Southeast Asia, balancing its historical ties with a modern approach to international diplomacy.\n\nTrong's health had been declining for several years. In 2019, his extended absence from various state and party events raised concerns, with the government attributing his condition to the weather and work intensity. Despite expectations that he would retire at the end of his term in 2021, the Communist Party granted him an unprecedented third term, contravening its own constitution, which limits party chiefs to two terms.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ngo Thi Man. While the Vietnamese government does not typically disclose details about the children of party officials, it is believed that he is also survived by a son and a daughter.", "source": {"uri":

With many fearful of being caught in its crosshairs, everyday transactions within business and the state apparatus have slowed.\n\nAccording to Linh, \"the campaign is enervating the economy, something that we can clearly see in economic growth over the past two to three years\".\n\nVietnam's economy grew by around five per cent in 2023, falling short of a government target of 6.50 per cent.\n\nUnder Trong, rights groups say a crackdown on dissent has also been escalating since 2016, with the government largely succeeding in crushing opposition.\n\nVietnam currently holds more than 160 people in prison for peacefully exercising their basic civil and political rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe courts convicted at least 28 rights campaigners and sentenced them to long prison terms during the first 10 months of 2023, the group said.\n\nInternational relations\n\nBorn in April 1944 into a farming family in the Hanoi suburbs, Trong studied literature and socialist theory before travelling to the Soviet Union to complete a doctorate degree in Communist Party building.\n\nHe began his career with a low-paid editing job at a magazine specialising in communist theory in Hanoi, before working his way up to editor-in-chief.\n\nIn 1994, he became a member of the party central committee -- his first nationally prominent political role -- and he was also head of the rubber-stamp national assembly before beginning his first term as party general secretary in 2011.\n\nHe stood out among Vietnam's top-ranking officials as a highly educated man.\n\nTrong oversaw the strengthening of the country's relationship with several international powers during his terms in office.\n\nIn 2023, US President Joe Biden paid a brief visit to Vietnam where the two former enemies announced upgrading bilateral ties to the highest level.\n\nTrong visited the United States in 2015 and made three trips to China. Most recently, in December 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping came to Hanoi, where the two pledged to deepen ties.\n\nVietnam has also become a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the world's most important companies over the past decade.\n\nBut many of them will be hoping a change in leadership means a halt to the anti-corruption campaign, said Linh, who told AFP that some complain of being badly affected by the disruption to business.\n\nHe said they will be thinking \"maybe after all the new figures and the top leadership settles down, we can go back and do business and keep investing in the country\". - AFP", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a rushed announcement, he was awarded the Gold Star, the country's highest honor suggesting that the party did not want to have to do this posthumously.\n\nBorn on April 14, 1944, in Hanoi, Trong was a lifelong communist ideologue. He was educated at Hanoi National University, the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh National Academy of Politics and Public Administration, and the Russian Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nHe spent several decades working for the party's ideological journal, T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n (Communist Review), where he was editor-in-chief from 1991-1996.\n\nHe joined the Communist Party of Vietnam's (CPV) Central Committee in 1994, and was first elected to the Politburo at the 9th Party Congress in 1996.\n\nFrom 2000-2006, he served as the chairman of the Hanoi Party Committee. From 2001-2006, he concurrently headed the Central Committee's Theoretical Council, making him the top communist ideologue.\n\nHe held his first and only non-Party assignment from 2006-2011, as the chairman of the National Assembly.\n\nHe was elected general secretary at the 11th Party Congress in January 2011 and was re-elected at the 12th Congress in January 2016 with an age waiver, after ousting Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who had vied to be the party chief.\n\nTrong despised Dung, whose economic liberalization set the stage for today's growth, but also led to surging inequality and corruption.\n\nTrong became president when incumbent Tran Dai Quang passed away in September 2018. He ceded that role at the 13th Congress in January 2021.\n\nParty control and anti-corruption\n\nHe showed little interest in foreign affairs, although he met President Barack Obama in the Oval Office in 2018, traveled to Beijing in October 2022, and hosted President Joe Biden in September 2023, Xi Jinping in December 2023 and Vladimir Putin in June 2024.\n\nHaving served five terms on the Politburo, Trong had significant staying power in a system that has tried to implement a regular transition for leaders. But there were limits to his power in a system of collective leadership.\n\nTrong failed to get his protege Tran Quoc Vuong, who oversaw his anti-corruption campaign, elected as his successor at the 13th Congress.\n\nTrong, who was reported to have suffered a stroke in late 2020, stayed on as a compromise figure. It was a clear violation of the two-term norm that was established after the disastrous quarter-century-long reign of Le Duan, whose death in July 1986 set off the Doi Moi reform era.\n\nAt the time, it was widely expected that Trung would be a caretaker until an agreement on his successor could be reached, but he showed no inclination in stepping down, despite his advanced age and failing health. By late 2023, he was believed to be residing at the 108 Military Hospital, a special facility for top leaders.\n\nThere were two big themes to Trung's long tenure: re-asserting party control and anti-corruption.\n\nTrong was concerned that the Communist Party was being sidelined as the economy grew and became more complex, and the loci of decision making shifted to technocrats, such as Vu Duc Dam, a cosmopolitan former deputy prime minister.\n\nWhile Trong understood the importance of economic growth, he never believed in performance-based legitimacy. Like China's Xi Jinping, he believed that economic growth could never come at the expense of party control.\n\nUnder him, the Politburo, which traditionally tended to be a careful balance of competing institutional interests, sectoral and regional representation, became dangerously out of balance, demonstrating the regime's insecurity.\n\nAt the Central Committee's 9th Plenum in May 2024, four new members of the Politburo represented the party, not the state apparatus.\n\nCrushing civil society\n\nToday, five of the 16 members came out of the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, with three coming out of the army. That half the Politburo represents the security sector, with a palpable dearth of economic expertise, is evidence of the party's priorities for the nation of 100 million people.\n\nUnder Trong, the government stepped-up efforts to quash Vietnam's nascent civil society, focusing, in turn, on religious organizations, lawyers, environmentalists, LGBTQ activists, independent journalists and social media influencers.\n\nThe Politburo issued Directive 24 in July 2023, which was a clarion call against \"peaceful evolution\" and the threat posed by \"colored revolutions\", which the document warned, could be fomented by international donors, foreign investors, and students studying overseas.\n\nPolitburo language became increasingly Chinese in tone, as were the tactics employed to defend the party's monopoly of power.\n\nLike Xi and his predecessors in Beijing, Trong viewed corruption as the party's greatest vulnerability.\n\nHe launched the \"Blazing Furnace\" anti-corruption campaign, moving the anti-corruption commission from state to party control, in 2013 with himself as chairman.\n\nTrong took down a slew of rivals within the 12th Politburo, including Dinh La Thang and Hoang Trung Hai, the party chiefs of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, respectively.\n\nBut the \"Blazing Furnace\" campaign spiraled out of control as it allowed then minister of public security, To Lam, to weaponize anti-corruption investigations to eliminate political rivals on the Politburo.\n\nBetween December 2022 and June 2024, seven of the 18 members of the 13th Politburo were forced to resign - a period of unprecedented political turmoil.\n\nTrong proved impotent as Lam, now serving as acting general secretary and president, removed his proteges - including President Vo Van Thuong and his assumed heir apparent National Assembly Chairman Vuong Dinh Hue - in the security chief's maneuvers to grab the top job.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nVietnam's Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong has died: state media\n\nMeet To Lam, Vietnam's Communist Party chief and successor to Nguyen Phu Trong\n\nTo Lam takes office as Vietnam's president\n\nVietnam's Communist Party might not attain the normalcy it seeks after reshuffle\n\nLam's ambitions created resentment\n\nTrong could only watch helplessly as Lam installed his Ministry of Security deputies, Luong Tam Quang and Nguyen Duy Ngoc, as his successor as the Minister of Public Security and the head of the Central Committee Office, respectively.\n\nAnd as Trong's health weakened, he routinely missed key meetings, with Lam - now president - standing in for him.\n\nIronically, the party apparatus emerged not just weaker and less collegial as a result of the anti-corruption campaign, but also became delegitimized in the eyes of the public as it exposed the sweeping extent of corruption among the senior leadership. Trong never took any responsibility for the damage he caused, and even seemed oblivious to it.\n\nTo be fair, Trong lived quite modestly and his children never involved themselves in business or profited from his position, a seeming birthright for the children of other top Hanoi leaders.\n\nUnder Communist Party rules, Luong Cuong, the head of the Secretariat, is supposed to stand in, but the Central Committee and Politburo announced that Lam will serve concurrently as president and acting general secretary.\n\nThat suggests that the Central Committee has determined that Lam will be elected to a full term at the 14th Congress in early 2026, though, at 67 now, would require an age waiver.\n\nPlanning for the congress is already underway. Having installed allies in key positions and having purged most rivals, Lam is in a very strong position.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the possibility that the Central Committee, which is much more powerful and independent than in China, could decide to elect a vastly new Politburo and a different general secretary.\n\nNot everyone on the Central Committee has been happy with the political instability caused by Lam's ambitious ascent, and party history offers the precedent of Le Kha Phieu, a hardline leader who was removed from office four years into his five-year term in 2001 amid public infighting that tripped up the economy.\n\nZachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

He also served as Vietnam's president from 2018 to 2020.\n\nHe cultivated an image of moderation but from 2017 unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\" that in the past year has had a chilling effect on the economy and at times paralysed public administration.\n\nIn foreign policy, Trong advocated having \"more friends, fewer foes\" while being as flexible as bamboo.\n\nThat stance culminated in a visit by President Joe Biden to Hanoi last September that saw Vietnam lift the United States to its highest diplomatic status alongside China, Russia, India and South Korea.\n\nThree months later, ties with Beijing - a major Communist economic partner despite recurring tensions over territorial claims in the South China Sea - were further boosted when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited.\n\nVietnam also hosted Russia's President Vladimir Putin in June and elevated Japan to its highest level of diplomatic status last year.\n\nTrong's crackdown on corruption has been long and enduring - leading to arrests or forced resignations of senior officials.\n\n\"The furnace is heating up, even fresh firewood can be burnt,\" Trong said months after he launched his signature policy.\n\nCritics lambasted the clampdown as politically motivated and rights groups also accused Trong of presiding over an intensified muzzling of dissent that has seen activists, journalists and users of social media imprisoned.\n\nBut he failed to uproot graft.\n\nIn late 2022, the country was shaken by its biggest financial fraud to date with the arrest of real-estate tycoon Truong My Lan and a run on deposits of the bank she controlled. Vietnam's central bank has had to embark on a massive rescue to avoid wider panic, costing more than $24 billion.\n\nTrong's crackdown led to the dismissal of two of Vietnam's presidents in about a year, the last one in March - developments that unnerved foreign investors who worried the anti-graft campaign had gotten out of hand.\n\nHAMMER AND SICKLE\n\nTrong's rule solidified in his second five-year term and despite his health issues, he secured a rare third term in 2021, with the party waiving a rule restricting the party chief position to two terms.\n\nAll in all, he held the party chief position for 13 years, second only to Le Duan, who ruled with an iron fist for 26 years after the death of Vietnam's founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.\n\nVietnam continued to flourish under Trong, benefiting from the 1986 \"Doi Moi\" reforms that transformed it from a war-torn agrarian nation into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.\n\nVietnam's annual GDP growth averaged 5.8% over the last decade and managed decent growth even during the coronavirus pandemic that crushed economies elsewhere.\n\nBorn and raised in the suburbs of Hanoi to a farmer couple, Trong was interested in folk literature from a young age, according to a biography. He majored in philology - the study of language and historical texts - at university and one of his first published works was a 1967 review of folk poetry.\n\nStudying for two years in the Soviet Union, he went on to gain a PhD in political science, writing his thesis on the Vietnam Communist Party's efforts to strengthen its connection with the masses. In 1991, he became editor-in-chief of the party's Communist Review magazine.\n\nTrong's image was that of a man who detested excess, lived in modest state-appointed housing and refused expensive Lunar New Year gifts from friends.\n\nTwo books - each some 600 pages long and published by the party in 2019 and 2021 respectively, extolled Trong's virtues - efforts that some critics likened to an attempt at building a cult of personality.\n\nA poem in the first book describes Trong as \"a noble man, sent by the spirits to purify the system,\" an apparent reference to the corruption crackdown. \"Hammer and sickle in hand, he dispels gloom, waiting for the sunshine,\" it said.\n\nTrong was married with a son and a daughter. His children, unlike those of other high-ranking officials, are normal public servants, government officials have said.\n\n(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen, Francesco Guarascio, Khanh Vu and James Pearson;

With many fearful of being caught in its crosshairs, everyday transactions within business and the state apparatus have slowed.\n\nAccording to Linh, \"the campaign is enervating the economy, something that we can clearly see in economic growth over the past two to three years\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVietnam's economy grew by around five percent in 2023, falling short of a government target of 6.50 percent.\n\nUnder Trong, rights groups say a crackdown on dissent has also been escalating since 2016, with the government largely succeeding in crushing opposition.\n\nVietnam currently holds more than 160 people in prison for peacefully exercising their basic civil and political rights, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe courts convicted at least 28 rights campaigners and sentenced them to long prison terms during the first 10 months of 2023, the group said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternational relations\n\nBorn in April 1944 into a farming family in the Hanoi suburbs, Trong studied literature and socialist theory before traveling to the Soviet Union to complete a doctorate degree in Communist Party building.\n\nHe began his career with a low-paid editing job at a magazine specializing in communist theory in Hanoi, before working his way up to editor-in-chief.\n\nIn 1994, he became a member of the party central committee -- his first nationally prominent political role -- and he was also head of the rubber-stamp national assembly before beginning his first term as party general secretary in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe stood out among Vietnam's top-ranking officials as a highly educated man.\n\nTrong oversaw the strengthening of the country's relationship with several international powers during his terms in office.\n\nIn 2023, US President Joe Biden paid a brief visit to Vietnam where the two former enemies announced upgrading bilateral ties to the highest level.\n\nTrong visited the United States in 2015 and made three trips to China. Most recently, in December 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping came to Hanoi, where the two pledged to deepen ties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVietnam has also become a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the world's most important companies over the past decade.\n\nBut many of them will be hoping a change in leadership means a halt to the anti-corruption campaign, said Linh, who told AFP that some complain of being badly affected by the disruption to business.\n\nHe said they will be thinking \"maybe after all the new figures and the top leadership settles down, we can go back and do business and keep investing in the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@manilatimes.net",

He is a thinker, a cultural advocate, and the theoretical leader of the Party. As an outstanding disciple who continually studies and follows the ideology, ethics, and style of the great President Ho Chi Minh, he has devoted his entire life to the revolutionary cause of the Party and our nation, living his life entirely for the country and the people.\n\nWith over 55 years of continuous revolutionary activity, honed through practical experience, strategic vision, and sharp thinking closely connected with practical summaries, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, together with the Party Central Committee, has creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh's ideology. He has continuously strengthened the Party, making it increasingly clean and strong, built a socialist rule-of-law state of the people, by the people, and for the people, and supplemented, perfected, and led the successful implementation of the renewal policy, bringing our country to a level of prosperity, potential, reputation, and international standing never seen before.\n\nThroughout his revolutionary career, Party work and Party building held a particularly important position for Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong. Applying Ho Chi Minh's ideology on Party building creatively, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong delved deeply into clarifying the essence of the Party, the role of the Party in the country's renewal process, and the construction of a ruling Party based on Vietnam's renewal practices. From this foundation, he, along with the Central Committee, formulated and successfully led the implementation of strategic policies on Party building and rectification; resolutely and persistently fighting against individualism, degradation, and corruption within the Party, while continuously fostering revolutionary ethics, intellect, and pioneering spirit. This effort has also emphasized maintaining good traditions and a close relationship with the people. Under the Party's leadership, headed by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, our Party has demonstrated courage and wisdom, leading the entire Party, people, and military to achieve significant successes in the national renewal process, thwarting all hostile schemes, and building a society that is truly \"ethical and civilized.\"\n\nAs Chairman of the National Assembly and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong was deeply committed to building a socialist rule of law state for the people, by the people. Under the leadership of Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, our Party for the first time issued a Resolution on continuing to build and perfect the socialist rule-of-law State of Vietnam in the new period. This Resolution aims to \"Perfect the socialist rule-of-law State of Vietnam, of the people, by the people, for the people, led by the Communist Party of Vietnam; with a complete legal system, strictly and consistently enforced; uphold the Constitution and the law, respect, ensure, and effectively protect human rights and citizen rights; unified state power, clearly assigned, closely coordinated, effectively controlled; professional, lawful, modern administration and judiciary; streamlined, clean, effective, and efficient state apparatus; a cadre of officials, civil servants, and public employees with sufficient qualities, capacities, truly professional, and upright; modern, effective national governance; meeting the requirements of rapid and sustainable national development, becoming a developed, high-income country oriented towards socialism by 2045.\" (1).\n\nImbued with Ho Chi Minh's ideology and deeply aware of the crucial role of culture, \"Culture is the soul of the nation,\" \"If culture remains, the nation remains,\" cultural advocate Nguyen Phu Trong, an outstanding leader on the Party's cultural front, has dedicated significant effort to building an advanced culture imbued with national identity. This culture truly serves as the spiritual foundation of society, an intrinsic strength, and an important driving force for national development. Under the leadership of comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, the 13th Party Congress documents comprehensively and profoundly addressed the cultural field. The National Conference on Culture, held after more than 70 years, marked a milestone in aligning the thoughts and actions of the entire Party, people, and military to strongly promote the role of culture in the cause of building and defending the Fatherland, realizing the aspiration for a prosperous and happy nation.\n\nWith deep political insight and strategic thinking, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, along with the Party Central Committee, has advanced Vietnam's foreign policy thinking, summarized practical experiences, and developed the art of \"Bamboo Diplomacy.\" This has built and developed a distinctive Vietnamese diplomacy characterized by the \"Vietnamese bamboo\" identity. Under the Party's leadership, directly guided by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, the essence of \"Bamboo Diplomacy\" has been strongly promoted, creating historic turning points and qualitative changes in Vietnam's relations with major partners. Never before has Vietnam's position, reputation, and image as a reliable partner, an active and responsible member on the international stage been as prominent as it is today. Vietnam has also never integrated as deeply and extensively into the global economy, international politics, and human civilization as it does now.\n\nDuring his tenure as President, Chairman of the National Defense and Security Council, and Commander-in-Chief of the People's Armed Forces, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong paid close attention to the People's Army and the People's Public Security forces. He focused on building a strong, cohesive, and unified military and police force. He frequently reminded the armed forces to internalize, learn from, and follow Ho Chi Minh's ideology, ethics, and style, emphasizing that \"Honor is the most sacred and noble thing.\" He encouraged them to wholeheartedly serve the Fatherland and the people, to \"rely on the people to work,\" and to \"be truly loyal, respectful, and loving to the people,\" maintaining a close bond with the people, protecting their interests, and enhancing their trust and support.\n\nUnder the Party's leadership, directly guided by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, significant achievements have been made in building a lean, strong, and clean armed force that meets the demands and tasks of the new situation. The police and military forces have remained united and coordinated closely, acting as both the sword and shield, and the two wings of a bird, to protect and maintain peace and stability for the country's development.\n\nCentral to the ideology of Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong is the focus on the people, humanity, and a wholehearted commitment to serving them, with the people being the core and center of the renovation process. Regarding the Party, he affirmed, \"Our Party must bear the highest responsibility to the people, taking care of their material and spiritual lives\"(2). He stated, \"If the Party's line does not reflect the interests of the people, the country, and the nation, and does not conform to the evolutionary laws of history, it is a wrong line\"(3), and \"Maintaining close ties with the people is the rule of existence, development, and activity of the Party, and it is the decisive factor that creates the Party's strength\"(4).\n\nWhen analyzing the differences between a socialist rule-of-law state and a capitalist rule-of-law state, he clarified, \"The essence of a socialist rule-of-law state differs from a bourgeois rule-of-law state in that: under capitalism, rule of law essentially serves to protect and serve the interests of the bourgeoisie, whereas, under socialism, rule of law serves to express and realize the people's mastery, ensuring and protecting the interests of the vast majority of the people\"(5).\n\nRegarding the socialist-oriented market economy, he summarized, \"A fundamental characteristic and an important attribute of the socialist orientation in our market economy is to link the economy with society, to unify economic policy with social policy, to achieve economic growth alongside social progress and fairness at every step, in every policy, and throughout the development process\"(6). He emphasized that \"every economic policy must aim at social development..., encouraging lawful enrichment alongside poverty alleviation, caring for those who have contributed to the country, and supporting those who are unfortunate or in difficult circumstances.\"\n\nUnder the leadership of Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, our Party has issued resolutions on socio-economic development and ensuring national defense and security across six economic regions nationwide until 2030, with a vision to 2045. These resolutions set goals, visions, directions, and solutions to create strong, breakthrough developments, contributing to the successful achievement of the country's goals over the next 100 years under the Party's leadership, aiming for Vietnam to become a developed country by the mid-21st century, fulfilling President Ho Chi Minh's aspiration to see our nation stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers of the five continents.\n\nThroughout his life, General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong has tirelessly dedicated himself to the revolutionary cause of the Party and our nation with a spirit and steely determination, never retreating in the face of obstacles and difficulties. He has affirmed a great character, upholding \"Honor as the most sacred and noble thing,\" maintaining principles, and living his life fully for the country and the people.\n\nComrade Nguyen Phu Trong is truly an exemplary and model figure of pure revolutionary ethics, \"public-spirited and selfless,\" with a simple lifestyle, democratic, dedicated, and scientific working style, respecting and loving people. He is highly respected, trusted, and loved by cadres, Party members, and the people, and is highly regarded and respected by international friends.\n\nWe are firmly confident that, under the leadership of the Party, by steadfastly applying and creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh's ideology, and the Party's theoretical line of innovation; by steadfastly maintaining national independence and socialism; and by adhering to the principles of Party building, our entire Party, people, and military will unite, work together, seize opportunities, and overcome challenges. This unity will ensure that our Party and political system are truly clean and comprehensively strong, leading to rapid and sustainable national development, firmly protecting the Fatherland. By 2030, when our Party celebrates its 100th anniversary, we aim for our country to become a developing nation with modern industry and high middle-income status. This will lay a solid foundation for achieving the goal by 2045, when we celebrate 100 years of the founding of the nation, to turn our country into a developed, high-income nation oriented towards socialism.\n\nGeneral To Lam, Politburo Member, President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\n\n(1) Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party on continuing to build and perfect the socialist rule-of-law State of Vietnam in the new period.\n\n(2) Nguyen Phu Trong: Building and Rectifying the Party - Some Theoretical and Practical Issues.

He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Mr Trong said in 2016 after being re-elected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that hit both business and political elites.\n\nSince 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared with none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nMr Trong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China.\n\nHowever, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy\", a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbour, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea.

During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party's power in Vietnam's single-party political system.\n\nIn the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more towards the governmental wing led by then-prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\n\nBorn in 1944 in Hanoi, Mr Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party's legitimacy.\n\n\"A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,\" Mr Trong said in 2016 after being re-elected to the party's helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful.\n\nHe launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the \"blazing furnace\" that hit both business and political elites.\n\nSince 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared with none between 1986 and 2016.\n\nMr Trong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China.\n\nHowever, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of \"bamboo diplomacy\", a phrase he coined that referred to the plant's flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics.\n\nVietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbour, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership.", "source": {"uri":

He joined the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1981, eventually rising to become the minister for public security - the country's top security official - in 2016.\n\nIn 2019, he was awarded the rank of general by then-president Trong.\n\nSecurity czar\n\nIn his capacity as security minister, he focused on internal politics and counter-intelligence - areas that may well have helped him to later cement his political powers.\n\nThe stint was not without controversy. In 2017, Lam was accused of being involved in the kidnapping of Trinh Xuan Thanh, a fugitive oil executive and former provincial official, in Berlin.\n\nThanh later returned to Hanoi through Slovakia. The government denied kidnapping but the case led to a temporary rift in diplomatic relations between Germany and Vietnam.\n\nBut it would fit a larger pattern of alleged transnational repression and quashing of dissent overseen by Lam.\n\nHis term as security minister saw the arrests and suspected kidnappings of journalist critics, including RFA blogger Truong Duy Nhat, who disappeared in Thailand in 2019 but is now in jail in Vietnam serving a 10-year sentence.\n\nGolden steak and 'Onion Bae'\n\nIn 2021, Lam was involved in another controversy after he was caught on video eating a piece of gold-plated steak at a luxury restaurant in London.\n\nA video clip of the general being fed a US$2,000 steak by celebrity chef Salt Bae went viral, causing a public outcry at home.\n\nThis was followed by a draconian crackdown, including the arrest and jailing of a noodle-seller nicknamed \"Onion Bae\" who had dared to ridicule Lam by posting a parody of the incident to social media. He remains in jail.\n\nLam subsequently ramped up anti-corruption crackdowns that saw off potential rivals within the party in what critics have said were clearly politically motivated investigations.\n\nLam's enthusiastic implementation of this so-called \"Burning Furnace\" campaign led to the sacking of half a dozen senior ministers and Politburo members within the span of months beginning in 2022.\n\nYet Lam and Trong, the ally he succeeds, are also said to have questionable hidden interests.\n\nIn May, the Ti\u1ebfng D\u00e2n newspaper revealed that a younger brother of To Lam, To Dung, was the chairman of the construction and real estate firm Xuan Cau Group, noting that the company had been conspicuously absent from any investigation even as it has won projects worth billions of Vietnamese dong with little oversight.\n\nPrivate man\n\nLittle else is known about the private life of Vietnam's new top man.\n\nHe does not appear to have ever given any remarks to Western media and nothing in English has been written of his immediate family, though Vietnamese reports say he has been twice married, first to Vu Hong Loan, the sister of a Vietnamese police major general and currently to Ngo Phuong Ly.\n\nHe appears to have several children. One daughter was revealed to have graduated from London's prestigious School of Oriental and Asian Studies, or SOAS, in 2023.\n\nOn the global stage, Lam has made clear his endorsement of the so-called \"Bamboo diplomacy\" Hanoi has undertaken to balance its relations between East and West.\n\nIn June, he welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin, weeks after his swearing in as president, calling him \"comrade\" and hailing a successful visit.\n\nHanoi saw visits from Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden within the previous nine months.\n\nWhether his caretaker role becomes a more permanent one, there seems little likelihood that Lam would veer from the established path. At his presidential swearing-in in May, he promised to \"continue to strengthen the party's capabilities, its ruling power and combat prowess.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfa.org", "dataType": "news",

The wrangling has had a negative impact on investment in a country that is home to large manufacturing operations for dozens of top multinationals.\n\nEconomic and foreign policy are not expected to change substantially, but civil liberties could be further eroded, they warned.\n\n\"If Lam became the most powerful man in Vietnam without checks and balances it would be bad for Vietnam and erode the norm of democratic centralism,\" said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nIt is, however, not clear how and when the party would replace Trong with an acting general secretary or a permanent one.\n\nLam could, in theory, continue in both roles until 2026 when all top jobs will be up for grabs for the next five-year term. Trong himself held the two positions for nearly three years until April 2021 after the death of a former president.\n\nBut Lam may face internal opposition that could even lead to a succession crisis, said Le Hong Hiep and Nguyen Khac Giang from the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in an article published on Friday.\n\nSTELLAR RISE\n\nThe son of a senior police officer, Lam studied security and obtained a PhD in law. He went on to become the minister for public security in 2016, a four-star general and was admitted in 2021 to the Communist Party's Politburo, the most powerful body in the country.\n\nHis ascent in roughly three months this year from minister to president and now also assuming the party chief's duties only underlines his grip on power, according to experts. His election as president had been seen as a \"stepping stone\" to the party chief job, they add.\n\nLam also appears to have maintained indirect control over the powerful public security ministry, which is now led by an official who hails from Lam's native province and is seen as close to him.\n\nLam's intense focus on public security is clearly outlined in his 2021 book titled \"New Findings on National Security for the 13th Party Congress\".\n\n\"The combination of national security together with economy, culture and foreign affairs is a must in our Party's vision in order to both build and protect socialism at the same time,\" he wrote.\n\nHe has been a central figure in the fight against corruption, Trong's signature policy known as \"blazing furnace\" that has been in place since 2017 and has recently intensified.\n\nSince 2023, two of Vietnam's presidents and one chair of parliament have quit over unspecified wrongdoing, with the public security ministry playing a central role in the investigations.\n\nLam's access to intelligence and sensitive information has also meant that he is feared, with Western diplomats often lowering their voices or not naming him when referring to Lam in private meetings.\n\nLast year, a noodle vendor was sentenced to five years in prison after posting a video that was considered to be mocking Lam. In the video, the vendor imitated a celebrity chef who fed Lam a gold-encrusted steak at his London restaurant while Vietnam was under COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021.\n\n(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio

The wrangling has had a negative impact on investment in a country that is home to large manufacturing operations for dozens of top multinationals. Economic and foreign policy are not expected to change substantially, but civil liberties could be further eroded, they warned.\n\n\"If Lam became the most powerful man in Vietnam without checks and balances it would be bad for VietnVietnamam and erode the norm of democratic centralism,\" said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy.\n\nIt is, however, not clear how and when the party would replace Trong with an acting general secretary or a permanent one.\n\nLam could, in theory, continue in both roles until 2026 when all top jobs will be up for grabs for the next five-year term. Trong himself held the two positions for nearly three years until April 2021 after the death of a former president.\n\nBut Lam may face internal opposition that could even lead to a succession crisis, said Le Hong Hiep and Nguyen Khac Giang from the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in an article published on Friday.\n\nStellar rise\n\nThe son of a senior police officer, Lam studied security and obtained a PhD in law. He went on to become the minister for public security in 2016, a four-star general and was admitted in 2021 to the Communist Party's Politburo, the most powerful body in the country.\n\nHis ascent in roughly three months this year from minister to president and now also assuming the party chief's duties only underlines his grip on power, according to experts. His election as president had been seen as a \"stepping stone\" to the party chief job, they add.\n\nLam also appears to have maintained indirect control over the powerful public security ministry, which is now led by an official who hails from Lam's native province and is seen as close to him.\n\nLam's intense focus on public security is clearly outlined in his 2021 book titled \"New Findings on National Security for the 13th Party Congress\".\n\n\"The combination of national security together with economy, culture and foreign affairs is a must in our Party's vision in order to both build and protect socialism at the same time,\" he wrote.\n\nHe has been a central figure in the fight against corruption, Trong's signature policy known as \"blazing furnace\" that has been in place since 2017 and has recently intensified.\n\nSince 2023, two of Vietnam's presidents and one chair of parliament have quit over unspecified wrongdoing, with the public security ministry playing a central role in the investigations.\n\nLam's access to intelligence and sensitive information has also meant that he is feared, with Western diplomats often lowering their voices or not naming him when referring to Lam in private meetings.\n\nLast year, a noodle vendor was sentenced to five years in prison after posting a video that was considered to be mocking Lam. In the video, the vendor imitated a celebrity chef who fed Lam a gold-encrusted steak at his London restaurant while Vietnam was under COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021.", "source": {"uri":

The leadership also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.\n\nThe country's politburo is central to steering policy and Trong's departure is unlikely to mark a break with existing domestic and foreign priorities.\n\n\"Major changes to Vietnam's economic and foreign policy should not be expected,\" wrote Le Hong Hiep and Nguyen Khac Giang, analysts at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute think tank.\n\n\"Ultimately, preserving the Party's rule will be the new leader's main priority, much like it was for Trong,\" they wrote in an analysis Friday.\n\n- 'Last man standing' -\n\nLam was born in 1957 in Hung Yen, then part of communist North Vietnam, and entered the ministry of public security after graduating from the police academy.\n\nHe has spent his whole career within the secretive ministry, which deals with the monitoring of dissent and surveillance of activists in the authoritarian state.\n\nRights groups say the government has in recent years stepped up a crackdown on civil society groups.\n\nHe is also deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption, and has used the anti-graft drive to outmanoeuvre his rivals for power, according to Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington.\n\nHe weaponised anti-corruption investigations to \"systematically take down rivals in the politburo who were eligible to become general secretary,\" he told AFP earlier this year.\n\nOther than Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, \"that leaves To Lam as the last man standing\".\n\nLam's allies have moved into key positions, including as his replacement at the head of the police.\n\nThe anti-corruption drive has proved popular with the public.\n\nBut analysts warn the turmoil may threaten the country's reputation for stability, which has helped it build a highly successful export-driven manufacturing economy, making products for major global brands.\n\nLam's elevation creates uncertainty for the country's beleaguered activists.\n\n\"He has proved to be repressive towards the democratic movement,\" dissident journalist Le Anh Hung told AFP.\n\n\"We only have hopes at the moment. Time will tell.\"\n\nLam's ascension has hit only one major road bump, in 2021, when a video surfaced of him enjoying a bite of steak smothered in gold leaf at a London restaurant, shortly after laying a wreath at the grave of Karl Marx.\n\nA noodle seller and former activist who had parodied the chef behind the pricey meal was later imprisoned.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

In recent months three top leaders quit following unspecified accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to an official statement released on Friday, Mr Trong died \"due to old age and serious illness\".\n\nIt comes a day after the Vietnamese government said in a surprise announcement that Mr Trong needed time to \"focus on active treatment\" for an unspecified medical condition. It added that the president would take over Mr Trong's duties in running the party's central committee, politburo and secretariat.\n\nOn that same day, the government also awarded Mr Trong the Gold Star, the highest honour given in Vietnam, for contributions to the party and country.\n\nMr Trong was seen as recently as late June, when he welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin on a state visit.\n\nBut after that he failed to attend several events, including the official launch of a book compiling some of his speeches.\n\nIn recent years, there were several instances where he would disappear from the public eye for long stretches of time. In 2019, he was reported to have had a stroke.\n\nLittle would be said about these absences by the state, though Mr Trong occasionally acknowledged he had health and ageing issues. Observers say the state's discretion over the health of party leaders and government officials is one way of portraying Vietnam as a stable nation under single-party rule.\n\nIn 2018, the country passed a law classifying top officials' health as a state secret, prompting the already tightly-controlled local media to be even more cautious. Intense speculation over his health has long thrived on social media.\n\nObservers say he leaves behind a deep but incomplete legacy. After rising to power in 2011 he stayed on as general secretary for a rare three terms. During this period he also acted as president from 2018 to 2021.\n\nHe saw the need to open up Vietnam's economy - under his watch, the country's GDP per capita more than doubled and Vietnam inked a series of free trade agreements with the West and Asian neighbours. Mr Trong was seen as more keen to engage the world than his predecessors, building relationships with US leaders as well as Mr Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_under_Xi_Jinping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Vietnam", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e036/live/a1b5bd10-45a4-11ef-af77-8713e5143fed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Since the 13 Party Congress in 2021, seven Politburo members -- Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Pham Binh Minh, Tran Tuan Anh, Vo Van Thuong, Vuong Dinh Hue, Truong Thi Mai and Dinh Tien Dung -- have been forced out. These dramatic dismissals exemplify Trong's multi-pronged strategy to reshape the CPV, which centres around four interconnected tools that he has persistently employed since first becoming party chief in 2011:\n\nAs of 18 July 2024, Trong's health had reportedly deteriorated, leading to the temporary appointment of To Lam, a Politburo member and State President, to oversee the Party's central operations. This unexpected transition raises questions about the continuity of Trong's leadership strategies and brings about a new period of uncertainty in Vietnam's political landscape.\n\nThis essay will examine each of the four tools to see how they have functioned over the course of Trong's unprecedented three terms in office.\n\nTHE ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVE\n\nSince 2016, the Vietnamese government has been actively cracking down on corruption. This has become a defining aspect of Nguyen Phu Trong's leadership and earned him respect and legitimacy within the Party. His re-election for a third term in 2021 was largely due to his success in leading this campaign and making it an integral part of Vietnamese politics.\n\nWhat is particularly remarkable is Trong's ability to coordinate his comprehensive anti-corruption strategy involving key party and state institutions. The Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the Central Internal Affairs Committee (CIAC), and the Central Inspection Commission (CIC), the three key organizations involved in implementing the campaign, all work closely under the direction of the Party.\n\nWhile the MPS has been involved in high-profile corruption cases, they operate under the centralized leadership and strategic direction of the Party's anti-corruption efforts. In fact, the campaign is not driven by a single institution, but is rather a coordinated effort led by the Party's Politburo and Trong himself.\n\nThe CIAC, which advises the Anti-Corruption Steering Committee chaired by Trong, plays a significant role in this campaign. They also have formal collaboration with the CIC, as mandated in Decision 243 issued by the CPV Secretariat in 2014.[1] Furthermore, they work with provincial party committees to develop and execute a unified anti-corruption strategy. This partnership involves sharing information and aligning regional efforts with national goals.\n\nThe CIC is responsible for investigating and punishing party members for corruption, and works alongside the MPS who enforce the law. A notable instance of this collaboration is the investigation into the \"Dai Ninh eco-urban area\", which involved both the MPS and the CIC.[2] This joint effort resulted in the arrest of several prominent figures, including Mai Tien Dung, the former Chairman of the Government Office, and Tran Duc Quan, the Secretary of the Lam Dong Provincial Party Committee.[3]\n\nThe coordination between these key party institutions has been crucial to the success of the anti-corruption campaign. However, the stringent measures taken in this campaign, while promoting ideological unity and alignment with Trong's vision, have also had unintended consequences. Recent reports have raised concerns from foreign governments and donors that Vietnamese officials may be hesitant in their decision-making due to fear of being scrutinized.[4] To maintain both effective governance and economic progress, a balanced approach that allows for decisive decision-making while upholding anti-corruption principles will be crucial for the Party.\n\nINSTITUTIONALIZING POWER BY STRATEGIC REGULATIONS\n\nAlongside the anti-corruption campaign, new regulations were introduced under Trong's tenure, rewriting the rules of the game in Vietnamese politics.[5] These regulations form a comprehensive framework for selecting, managing, and dismissing party leaders and cadres.\n\nOne of these regulations, Decision 244, was issued by the Party Central Committee in 2014 and set guidelines for nominating party leaders through internal electoral processes.[6] In 2020, Instruction 03 was issued by the Party Secretariat and an amendment was introduced that held nominators accountable for the qualifications and suitability of their nominees.[7] This change raised the stakes for nominating candidates outside the formal framework, arguably leading to fewer unexpected nominations at the 13 Party Congress in 2021. In addition, Regulation 41 was issued in 2021 which outlined the principles, authority, and procedures for dismissing or accepting resignations from party leaders and officials.[8] It clarified the grounds for removal, such as disciplinary issues or poor performance, and specified conditions for voluntary resignations. These regulations, introduced between 2014 and 2022, show Trong's consistent efforts to refine and tighten control over the Party's human resources, from candidate selection to dismissal and post-resignation arrangements. They also give central party organs, particularly the Politburo, more power in personnel decisions, giving Trong and his supporters greater control over key leadership positions.\n\nMoreover, the process by which new Politburo members were selected at the latest 9 Plenum in May 2024 indicates the centralization of power and the strategic use of formal party mechanisms under Trong's leadership. Four new members were appointed to the Politburo following a vetting process that highlights the application of democratic centralism in the Party. According to private sources, the Politburo first conducted a vote among themselves to shorten a long list of nominees which included candidates from various branches of the Party and the state, such as two nominees from the MPS. The four individuals who made it through this initial vetting -- Le Minh Hung, Nguyen Trong Nghia, Do Van Chien, and Bui Thi Minh Hoai -- were then put forward for the Central Committee to vote into the Politburo.\n\nNotably, all four successful candidates were previously Secretariat members, suggesting a preferential pathway from the Secretariat to the Politburo. This pattern, which also occurred in 2021 when all 2016 Secretariat members were promoted to the Politburo, reflects a consolidation of influence and a new norm in leadership transitions favouring established insiders.\n\nThese developments demonstrate how Trong uses formal party structures to reinforce his vision, ensuring that those promoted to the highest ranks align with his ethos. The elevation of Secretariat members to the Politburo, even amid a depleted leadership due to recent purges, underscores the structural changes Trong is promoting to solidify his control over the Party's direction.\n\nSHIFTING REGIONAL DYNAMICS\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a notable shift in the representation of different regions in the highest echelons of the CPV. An examination of the Politburo and Central Committee shows a gradual decrease in the number of members from the southern regions of the country.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the South had five members in the Politburo, making up about one-third of the total. This number increased during the leadership of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung from 2006 to 2011, to six, or 40 per cent of the Politburo. This level of representation remained steady until 2016.\n\nHowever, there has been a significant shift under the leadership of General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong from 2016 to 2021. During this period, the South's representation in the Politburo decreased to four members, accounting only for 21 per cent of the total. This trend has continued during Trong's third term, with the South now having only three seats, or approximately 17 per cent of the Politburo.\n\nSome see this as a deliberate effort to promote northern dominance. However, Trong's approach focuses on selecting candidates based on their qualifications, ideology, and loyalty to the Party rather than adhering to strict regional quotas. The decline in southern representation can be seen as a result of this emphasis on broader criteria, with the anti-corruption campaign and new regulations providing a means to remove problematic officials regardless of their regional affiliations. This strategy seems designed to strengthen control over leadership selection while deflecting concerns about regional imbalances.\n\nNevertheless, the Party under Trong recognizes the importance of having some regional diversity. The example of former President Vo Van Thuong, a southerner who briefly gained prominence, suggests that regional balance is still a consideration, even if it is not the primary factor. The current composition of the Politburo also reflects this balancing act.\n\nWhile northern members like Le Minh Hung, Bui Thi Minh Hoai, and Do Van Chien have been added, the elevation of Tran Thanh Man to the National Assembly chairman position and the inclusion of Nguyen Trong Nghia maintain some representation from the southern region. These moves highlight a strategic approach that values regional identities while prioritizing ideological alignment and qualifications.\n\nPERSONAL TIES AND PARTY RULES: THE DUAL ROUTES TO LEADERSHIP ROLES\n\nIn Vietnamese politics, personal relationships and networks have always played a significant role alongside the formal system of the Party in developing leaders. General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong has deftly combined these two aspects to strengthen his influence and shape the future direction of the Party.\n\nTrong's approach is notable for his ability to exercise control over the leadership selection process from multiple angles. As mentioned above, through the introduction of new regulations, he has shaped the formal criteria and procedures for selecting leaders. These regulations pave the way for promoting individuals who align with his vision and meet the desired qualifications.\n\nAt the same time, Trong has leveraged his position as the top leader to cultivate personal relationships and mentor rising figures who support his agenda. By nurturing and supporting specific candidates who share his ideological commitments and policy goals, Trong can directly influence the leadership line-up and ensure that his preferred candidates are promoted. This is evident in Regulation 214, which outlines the requirements for the position of general secretary. The regulation states that the general secretary should have \"the ability to lead and build a team of strategic-level cadres, especially successors and key cadres\".[9] This implies that those in the top leadership position, like Trong, have both the interest and the capacity to prepare and nurture the next generation of leaders.\n\nThis dual approach of utilizing both formal party rules and personal relationships is important because it allows Trong to create a framework that supports his broader vision for the Party's future. By linking informal networks to formal party structures and regulations, he can control the leadership selection process in a way that goes beyond simply relying on connections.\n\nThe careers of former National Assembly Chairman Vuong Dinh Hue and former Permanent Member of the CPV Secretariat Tran Quoc Vuong, whose rise through the ranks coincided with Trong's tenure as general secretary, exemplify this dynamic. They advanced through the Party's evaluation process based on qualifications and performance, while their personal ties to Trong also played a significant role. However, Vuong Dinh Hue's resignation in April 2024, amid allegations of serious violations, highlights the nuanced application of the Party's disciplinary measures. His exit underscores a critical point: close relationships with top leadership do not guarantee immunity from the Party's enforcement of anti-corruption standards. This incident demonstrates that Trong's strategic tools operate regardless of an individual's status or connections, although unseen political developments, such as his or her involvement in a corruption scandal that is previously unknown to the Party's leadership, might also play a role.\n\nTHE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE FOUR TOOLS\n\nThe four tools appear to have been intentionally designed to work together in order to influence the power structure and succession planning within the Party. The recent high-level personnel changes demonstrate how Trong's efforts to combat corruption, centralize power through new regulations, balance regional dynamics, and blend personal relationships with party rules have all played a role in reshaping Vietnam's political landscape.\n\nThe anti-corruption drive remains the most visible tool, evidenced by the forced resignations of high-ranking officials, particularly presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong, and National Assembly Chairman Vuong Dinh Hue.The centralization of power through new regulations has also played a significant role in streamlining leadership processes and changing expectations regarding the stability of top officials. The large number of dismissals has now become a \"new normal\", as codified by these regulations. Additionally, a balanced approach towards regional dynamics has been strategically utilized to maintain northern dominance while ensuring that regional diversity is respected. The blend of personal relationships and party rules has allowed Trong to shape the Party's leadership, but does not guarantee that those close to him are immune from disciplinary actions.\n\nThe recent dismissals of high-ranking officials such as Phuc, Thuong and Hue demonstrate how these four tools reinforce each other. The anti-corruption campaign provided the justification for their removal, while the new rules and regulations set the standards they were found to have violated. These actions highlight that regional affiliations cannot be invoked as a safeguard against serious evidence of corruption. The blend of party rules and personal relationships underscores the expectation that officials adhere to party priorities and maintain a good public image. This application of the four tools seeks to strengthen the Party by elevating integrity standards, which is distinct from Western democratic models. Instead of relying on institutional checks and balances, public elections, and competition between political parties, Trong's approach focuses on maintaining internal Party discipline and ideological unity, as well as centralized control, top-down accountability and internal mechanisms to combat corruption and maintain the CPV's legitimacy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBy utilizing the four leadership tools, Trong has aimed to ensure the Party's stability by tackling corruption and promoting capable leaders. While Trong's initiatives have started to change the Party's leadership framework, the cases of high-ranking officials who were purged or forced to resign, even after being elected to top positions, highlight the mixed results of his reforms and the persistence of informal power structures.\n\nWith Trong's health reportedly deteriorating and the temporary appointment of To Lam to oversee the Party's central operations, Trong's strategic approach is facing an unexpected and critical test. This turn of events may significantly impact the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, the centralization of power, the regional representation strategy, and the balance between personal connections and party regulations.\n\nAs the 14th CPV National Congress in early 2026 approaches, the situation has become even more complex. The recent high-profile exits have already thinned the Politburo's ranks, and now the uncertainty surrounding Trong's health adds another layer of complication to the planning of leadership transitions. The short timeframe, combined with the unexpected developments surrounding Trong's health conditions, further challenges the process of identifying and training potential leaders who can continue Trong's agenda while addressing Vietnam's evolving needs. These needs remain pressing: finding a balance between fighting corruption and promoting efficient governance and economic growth, meeting the changing expectations for transparency and accountability in the Party's operations, and navigating the intricacies of leadership succession within the party structure.\n\nThe future of Vietnam's political landscape will be influenced not only by how the Party navigates this period of temporary leadership, but also by the ability of Trong's eventual successor to maintain their authority and the integrity of the reforms. It remains to be seen whether future leaders will continue to follow Trong's approach or chart a new direction in tackling the country's evolving challenges.", "source": {"uri": "iseas.edu.sg",

The CPC and the Chinese people lost a good comrade, a good brother and a good friend. With immense grief, we extend our deepest condolences and sincerest sympathies to the Central Committee of the CPV, the Vietnamese government and the Vietnamese people.\n\nTrong was a staunch Marxist and a great leader of the CPV and the Vietnamese people. He dedicated his entire life to the causes of his party and nation, making outstanding contributions to Vietnam's Doi Moi (reform), socialist construction, and the development of the world socialist movement.\n\nTrong was a close comrade and a sincere friend of the CPC and the Chinese people. He inherited and developed the traditional friendship of \"comrades plus brothers\" between the two parties and two countries, and forged a profound friendship with the CPC and Chinese leaders.\n\nTrong and General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping have jointly elevated China-Vietnam relations to a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance and vigorously promoted the continuous development of China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. The CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will always miss Trong.\n\nWe believe that the CPV and the Vietnamese people will turn grief into strength, carry on the legacy of Trong, unite and strive to make new and greater achievements in the cause of Doi Moi and socialist construction.\n\nChina and Vietnam are socialist neighbors connected by mountains and rivers and a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. China has always regarded Vietnam as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and stands ready to work with Vietnam to continuously consolidate political mutual trust, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and push forward the building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future to benefit the two peoples and contribute to regional and world peace and development.", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy\u1ec5n_Ph\u00fa_Tr\u1ecdng", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Vietnam", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Vietnam", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110\u1ed5i_M\u1edbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marxism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013Vietnam_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013Vietnam relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743079", "eventUri": "eng-9743079", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

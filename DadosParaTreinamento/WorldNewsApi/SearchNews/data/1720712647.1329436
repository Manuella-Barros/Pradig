In an interactive session with journalists on Sunday in Jalingo, Zubairu said appointed stooges as commissioners. Lamenting the snail speed at which he said the state is moving, the governor, he accused the governor of piloting the government as a one man business. Zubairu, who also announced that most of the commissioners have no knowledge of office procedures, said they have no idea of what happens under their ministries as the governor takes unilateral decisions without their inputs. \"The commissioners do not even know what goes on in their ministries and they cannot challenge the governor because they are mostly small boys and lack administrative experience and courage. \"It is so sad that the governor deliberately appointed stooges as commissioners who lack knowledge of the offices they occupy. \"They don't raise memos for contracts executed from their offices as the governor awards contracts without their knowledge and direct contractors to commence work.\" Alleging that most of the contractors executing projects in the state are from the South/South geopolitical zone while others are the governor's relatives, he added that due process is not being followed in the award of the contracts. Zubairu also faulted the governor's Free Education program, which according to him is only on television, newspapers and radio. \"There are several dilapidated schools all over the State that require government attention,\" he said. Denying the accusations, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Digital Communication, Emmanuel Bello, said commissioners who are busy working hard with the governor can't be called stooges. \"Governor Kefas is the only one addressing the crisis of education that hasn't received attention over the years. The free education policy comes with major plans for teachers' welfare, better classrooms, and modern teaching aids,\" he said.", "summary": "<img width=\"973\" height=\"544\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-04-10.22.37-AM.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-04-10.22.37-AM.jpg 973w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-04-10.22.37-AM-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" /><p>A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Taraba State, Alhaji Aliyu Zubairu, has hit out at Governor Agbu Kefas over alleged appointment of stooges as commissioners.

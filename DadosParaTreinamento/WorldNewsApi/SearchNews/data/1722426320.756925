Over a couple of election cycles, they said their safe urban seats could shift toward the Greens or independents without careful messaging in the constituency. The current strategy of appealing to voters switching from the Tories and those who backed Brexit isn\u2019t geared toward urban, liberal electorates. \u201cThe question is: is this going to be the sort of thing which hurts them for one election?\u201d said Oxford University researcher Andrew Barclay. \u201cOr is it actually a permanent chipping away at the emotional link between Muslim voters and the Labour party?\u201d The rumblings of discontent on Starmer\u2019s left underscore the potential fragility of his political mandate, even if he wins big in Thursday\u2019s election. Deep local fiscal problems and an increasingly uncertain global security environment means his would-be government could quickly face issues that exacerbates divisions in Labour. Central to the shift in sentiment, especially among Muslims, is Starmer\u2019s stance on the Israel-Hamas war. He\u2019s been steadfast in his support of Israel\u2019s right to self defense since the conflict erupted in October following Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel. In an early interview, he appeared to say Israel had the \u201cright\u201d to withhold power and water from Gaza \u2014 further damaging his standing with Muslims, as did the perception that he was slow to call for a cease-fire.", "summary": "Birmingham resident Johur Uddin has always voted Labour.

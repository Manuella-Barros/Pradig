Martin Truex Jr. has three wins in the last five races at this track, but he is still seeking his first win this season. He is the 5-1 favorite in the 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 odds, followed by Christopher Bell (15-2) and Kyle Larson (15-2). NASCAR visited its first road course of the season 10 weeks ago when William Byron won at Circuit of the Americas in March, and he is among the top NASCAR at Sonoma contenders at 17-2. Supercar drivers Will Brown (28-1) and Cameron Waters (50-1) are making their NASCAR debuts. Shane Van Gisbergen won the Chicago Street Race last July after coming over from the Supercar series, so should you consider Brown or Waters with your 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 bets?

They're sharing their best bets only at SportsLine. 2024 Toyota/Save Mart 350 expert picks One of Bobbitt and Greco's top NASCAR bets: They are backing Chase Elliott to finish ahead of Tyler Reddick in a head-to-head prop bet that pays -110. Elliott has been knocking on the door of a win at Sonoma throughout his career, posting five top-eight finishes in his last six races. He finished second in 2021, eighth in 2022 and fifth in 2023. Elliott is a seven-time winner on road courses in the Cup Series, and he has finished inside the top 10 in 16 of his last 22 road-course races. Reddick does not have good memories at this track, finishing outside the top 15 in all three of his attempts. He finished 19th in 2021, 35th in 2022 and 33rd in 2023, so there is a stark contrast between these drivers at Sonoma. See what other NASCAR picks they like at SportsLine.

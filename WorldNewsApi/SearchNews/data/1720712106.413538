Independent Councillor James Charity is the fourth councillor to be elected to Athenry/Oranmore while Cllr Michael \u2018Moegie\u2019 Maher (FG) took the fourth seat in Loughrea. Cllr Charity, a barrister who had originally announced his political retirement, changed his mind when he realised nobody would be running in his heartland of Corrandulla.

Peter Feeney (FG) still has 315 votes to win from transfers before will make the quota, with the count expected to continue for some hours yet. Cllr Maher (FG) got 100 votes from the transfers of Cllr Curley in the second count in Loughrea, reflecting the strong town vote for both politicians. The remaining seat will go to Cllr Ivan Canning (FF), who will have to wait another two counts at least to make up the 336 votes to pass the quota line.

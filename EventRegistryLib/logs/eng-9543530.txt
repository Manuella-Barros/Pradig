That marked the biggest peak audience ever for the Derby on NBC.\n\nThe 16.7 million viewers was up 13% from last year's 14.8 million.\n\nNBC Sports said Sunday it was the biggest Derby audience since 18.5 million watched Sunday Silence win in 1989, when the race was shown on ABC.\n\nNBC Sports and Churchill Downs Inc. have agreed to a multiyear contract extension that will keep the Derby on the network through 2032.\n\n___\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "virginislandsdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virgin Islands Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Most years, the promise of a Triple Crown champion captures a wider audience and powers Preakness Stakes betting.\n\nThe odds to win the Preakness Stakes are heavily influenced by the results of the Kentucky Derby, especially if those top horses ran a faster pace at Churchill Downs. Preakness Stakes odds are often released shortly after the conclusion of the Derby and will take action until race time.\n\nPicks & Predictions\n\nOur expert horse racing analysts, will give their best bets, including their favorite trifecta pick, in our Preakness Stakes picks and predictions.\n\nHorses\n\nThe field for the Preakness Stakes is limited to 14 horses (compared to 20 for the Kentucky Derby) with entries based on graded stakes earnings as well as lifetime earnings. The Top 5 horses from the Kentucky Derby are granted automatic entrance, however, not all horses that run in the Derby will run in the Preakness.\n\nWhere can I bet on the Preakness Stakes?\n\nSeveral legal horse racing specialist betting sites offer odds on the most popular races from around the world, including the Preakness Stakes.\n\nTriple Crown races like the Preakness Stakes have a massive mainstream appeal and bring out many bettors new to horse racing.

Between 1901 and 1924 the distance moved between 1 mile and 70 yards and 1 1/8 miles before being set at its current length of 1 3/16 miles (9.5 furlongs).\n\nTriple Crown road\n\nTwenty-three horses have won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, setting up a run at the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes. Only 13 of those contenders have completed the Triple Crown, with the most recent being Justify (2018) and American Pharoah (2015).\n\nFastest Preakness\n\nThe speed record for the 1 3/16-mile Preakness Stakes belongs to the famed Triple Crown champion Secretariat who ran the 9.5 furlongs in a time of 1 minute and 53 seconds in 1973.\n\nThe 2020 Preakness winner Swiss Skydiver not only ran the second-fastest Preakness time at 1 3/16 miles but set the all-time fastest run by a filly at 1:53.28. The 2020 Preakness was held in October rather than May due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPimlico Race Course\n\nThe Preakness Stake is held at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, which opened in 1870. The course has a 1-mile dirt oval surrounded by a 7/8-mile turf track and can accommodate 120,000 spectators including the infield venue. Pimlico is nicknamed \"Old Hilltop\" due to a hill in the infield, which has recently become infamous for its party atmosphere during Preakness weekend.\n\nBlack-Eyed Susans\n\nKnown as the \"Run for the Black-Eyed Susans\", the winner of the Preakness Stakes is adorned with a blanket of Black-Eyed Susans - the state flower of Maryland - and patrons enjoy a drink of the same name, which includes equal parts bourbon, vodka, and peach schnapps mixed with orange juice and sour mix.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furlong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifecta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trifecta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Skydiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Skydiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justify_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justify (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pharoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Pharoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretariat (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bourbon whiskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/00b3ac60-a88d-41d7-b8a3-5e54d2cd8521.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543530", "eventUri": "eng-9543530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 125}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2147, "textEnd": 2153}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

This distance was established in 1925. Before that, the event had six different distances.\n\nIt's too early to know what horses will be contending for the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The biggest question on horse-racing fans' minds is about Derby winner Mystik Dan.

At that age, horses are just beginning to mature and there is still an aura of the unknown when it comes to their performances.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/d66efb7a-af96-4873-8b6b-be2d230d5698.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543530", "eventUri": "eng-9543530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 518, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Post time is scheduled for 6:50 p.m. ET. Legendary trainer Bob Baffert wasn't eligible to enter any horses into the Kentucky Derby because of a suspension by the Kentucky Racing Commission, but the eight-time Preakness winner is expected to be back in action at Pimlico. Baffert's Muth is the 10-11 favorite in the 2024 Preakness Stakes odds, while his Imagination is 5-1.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan is 3-1, while Chad Brown's Tuscan Gold is 5-1. Before making any 2024 Preakness Stakes picks, be sure to see the horse racing predictions and futures bets from SportsLine's elite horse racing expert Jody Demling.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Kentucky Derby having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Preakness Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 19 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023. He keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby winner was poised for victory or a massive upset in the second leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2024 Preakness Stakes futures already on the board, Demling is sharing his picks and 2024 Preakness Stakes predictions over at SportsLine. Go here to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Preakness Stakes predictions\n\nOne of Demling's surprising 2024 Preakness Stakes picks: He is high on Tuscan Gold, even though he's a 5-1 longshot that didn't run in the Kentucky Derby. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. After finishing fourth in a maiden race won by eventual Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone at Aqueduct last November, Tuscan Gold broke his maiden in a 1 1/16-mile race at Gulfstream Park in January.\n\nHe followed that up with a third-place finish at the Louisiana Derby and should be well-rested to make his Triple Crown debut at Pimlico . Expected jockey Tyler Gaffalione was a Preakness winner with War of Will in 2019 and trainer Chad Brown is a two-time Preakness winner with Cloud Computing in 2017 and Early Voting in 2022.

Trainer Kenny McPeek has not committed to running Mystik Dan in the Preakness, telling the Maryland Jockey Club that he and owners would let the rest of the week play out before making a decision on the 3-year-old colt.\n\nEntries for the Preakness must be made by Monday, when the post position draw is held.\n\nIf Mystik Dan does not run in the Preakness, it will be the fifth time in six years that the race goes on without a true Triple Crown on the line, a combination of Derby circumstances, the pandemic and other factors. McPeek has expressed concern about putting the horse through another two-week turnaround, which did not work out so well in November.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But more than anything, I just want to make sure he's moving good and eating good and happy. And at this stage, I like what I see.\"\n\nMcPeek was cautious the morning after the Derby, saying he was not ready to commit to the Preakness and noting that Mystik Dan ran poorly when he came back on 13 days' rest as a 2-year-old. The Derby and Preakness are two weeks apart, a condensed schedule that has dissuaded more and more Derby trainers from bringing their horses to Pimlico Race Course for the second leg of the Triple Crown in recent years.\n\nMcPeek's tone has shifted to greater optimism over the last few days as he's watched Mystik Dan's appetite and energy rebound, but he continues to say he won't rush to a decision on Preakness, with the entry deadline looming Monday.\n\n\"I've said it repeatedly: An old guy told me long ago, 'Never make a decision until you absolutely, positively have to,' \" McPeek said. \"If he's healthy, we're not scared to go. If we feel like he needs more time, he'll get it. It's all gray; it's not black and white.\"\n\nHe added that the 1 3/16 mile distance of the Preakness (which McPeek won in 2020 with the filly Swiss Skydiver) might suit his horse better than the 1 1/4 miles of the Derby.\n\nMystik Dan won the Derby in a scintillating three-way photo finish. If he were to run in the Preakness, he'd face a field of well-rested contenders, led by the Bob Baffert-trained pair of Muth and Imagination.\n\nSeveral other contenders have joined the list of probables for the $2 million Preakness in recent days. The only Derby horse currently committed to the race is 17th-place finisher Just Steel, trained by six-time Preakness winner D. Wayne Lukas, who also plans to enter Seize the Grey.\n\nLukas feels Just Steel has a better race in him after the quick early pace in the Derby wiped him out. \"It was too much, much too early,\" the 88-year-old trainer said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nMugatu, fifth-place finisher in the talent-stacked April 6 Blue Grass Stakes, is also pointed toward the Preakness. \"We were a little frustrated we didn't get into the Derby,\" trainer Jeff Engler said. \"We feel the more distance the better for this horse. I do like the mile and 3/16, so we're going to head up.\"\n\nUncle Heavy, fifth in the April 6 Wood Memorial at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack, joined the Preakness field Wednesday.\n\nCopper Tax, winner of the April 20 Federico Tesio Stakes at Laurel Park, remains a possible entrant.\n\n149th Preakness Stakes\n\n-- Pimlico Race Course\n\n-- Saturday, May 18, approx. 6:50 p.m.\n\n-- TV: NBC\n\n\u00a92024 Baltimore Sun.

The Belmont Stakes, being run at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York each of the next two years, is June 8.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Jockey_Club", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Jockey Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Christian_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classical Christian education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

But more than anything, I just want to make sure he's moving good and eating good and happy. And at this stage, I like what I see.\"\n\nMcPeek was cautious the morning after the Derby, saying he was not ready to commit to the Preakness and noting that Mystik Dan ran poorly when he came back on 13 days' rest as a 2-year-old. The Derby and Preakness are two weeks apart, a condensed schedule that has dissuaded more and more Derby trainers from bringing their horses to Pimlico Race Course for the second leg of the Triple Crown in recent years.\n\nMcPeek's tone has shifted to greater optimism over the last few days as he's watched Mystik Dan's appetite and energy rebound, but he continues to say he won't rush to a decision on Preakness, with the entry deadline looming Monday.\n\n\"I've said it repeatedly: An old guy told me long ago, 'Never make a decision until you absolutely, positively have to,'\" McPeek said. \"If he's healthy, we're not scared to go. If we feel like he needs more time, he'll get it. It's all gray; it's not black and white.\"\n\nHe added that the 1 3/16 mile distance of the Preakness (which McPeek won in 2020 with the filly Swiss Skydiver) might suit his horse better than the 1 1/4 miles of the Derby.\n\nMystik Dan won the Derby in a scintillating three-way photo finish. If he were to run in the Preakness, he'd face a field of well-rested contenders, led by the Bob Baffert-trained pair of Muth and Imagination.\n\nSeveral other contenders have joined the list of probables for the $2 million Preakness in recent days. The only Derby horse currently committed to the race is 17th-place finisher Just Steel, trained by six-time Preakness winner D. Wayne Lukas, who also plans to enter Seize the Grey.\n\nLukas feels Just Steel has a better race in him after the quick early pace in the Derby wiped him out. \"It was too much, much too early,\" the 88-year-old trainer said.\n\nMugatu, fifth-place finisher in the talent-stacked April 6 Blue Grass Stakes, is also pointed toward the Preakness. \"We were a little frustrated we didn't get into the Derby,\" trainer Jeff Engler said. \"We feel the more distance the better for this horse. I do like the mile and 3/16, so we're going to head up.\"\n\nUncle Heavy, fifth in the April 6 Wood Memorial at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack, joined the Preakness field Wednesday.\n\nCopper Tax, winner of the April 20 Federico Tesio Stakes at Laurel Park, remains a possible entrant.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "childs_walker@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Childs Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Skydiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Skydiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Tesio_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Tesio Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

Trainer Kenny McPeek has not committed to running Mystik Dan in the Preakness, telling the Maryland Jockey Club that he and owners would let the rest of the week play out before making a decision on the 3-year-old colt.\n\nEntries for the Preakness must be made by Monday, when the post position draw is held.\n\nIf Mystik Dan does not run in the Preakness, it will be the fifth time in six years that the race goes on without a true Triple Crown on the line, a combination of Derby circumstances, the pandemic and other factors. McPeek has expressed concern about putting the horse through another two-week turnaround, which did not work out so well in November.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wayne Lukas bringing 17th-place finisher Just Steel, along with Seize the Grey, who won the Pat Day Mile on the undercard Saturday. Lukas, 88, has won the Preakness six times.\n\nAlso going is Mugatu, the last horse left out of the Derby field, with trainer Jeff Engler calling the Preakness a logical spot.\n\nTwo-time Triple Crown-winning trainer Bob Baffert is expected to have a couple of horses in the Preakness after he was unable to run any in the Derby because of the ban on him that Churchill Downs extended for an additional year, based on Medina Spirit's positive drug test from 2021.

Whether the horse will run in the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, Maryland is still up in the air, according to trainer Kenny McPeek.\n\nThe decision on Mystik Dan could come as late as Monday, when post positions are drawn for the May 18 race, per the Louisville Courier Journal. McPeek is still keeping tabs on Mystik Dan to see how the horse is recovering after its dramatic Kentucky Derby win.\n\nAt the moment, there is zero clarity on Mystik Dan's status for the Preakness Stakes.\n\n\"If he's healthy, we're not scared to go,\" McPeek said. \"If we feel like that he needs more time, we'll give it to him. It's all gray; there is no black and white.\"\n\nThere are just two weeks between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, which doesn't give the horses much time to rest and recover before the second leg of the Triple Crown. In fact, most of the horses competing for a spot in the Preakness did not run at Churchill Downs.\n\nThat short turnaround won't prevent McPeek from letting Mystik Dan compete, as long as the horse is up to it physically.\n\n\"I'm not scared to do that; so we'll see,\" McPeek said. \"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nMystik Dan is coming off one of the most dramatic finishes in Kentucky Derby history. Three horses, including Sierra Leone and Forever Young, crossed the finish line almost simultaneously. After a review, it was determined Mystik Dan won by a nose.\n\nThe post position draw for the Preakness Stakes is on Monday at 5:30 p.m. ET.

Kenny McPeek provides update on Kentucky Derby 150 winnerBrooks Holton, Louisville Courier JournalMay 8, 2024 at 7:32 PM\n\nKenny McPeek is still mulling whether he'll enter Kentucky Derby 150 winner Mystik Dan in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nA decision could come as early as this weekend or as late as Monday, before post positions are drawn at 5:30 p.m. for the $2 million, Grade 1 race on May 18 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.\n\nIt hinges on how the son of Goldencents is moving and eating.\n\n\"An old guy told me a long time ago, 'Never make a decision until you absolutely, positively have to,'\" the trainer said Wednesday morning, after Mystik Dan worked at Churchill Downs for the first time since the Run for the Roses.\n\n\"I know that's frustrating for you all -- you want me to decide now -- but what if I change my mind?\" he added. \"I really don't usually make a decision on any horse that I train until I open the condition book.\"\n\nMystik Dan jogged a mile and galloped a little more than a mile Wednesday morning. McPeek said the horse is \"doing great\" and will likely gallop 1 3/8 miles Thursday, Friday and Saturday before a decision is made regarding the Preakness.\n\n\"If he's healthy, we're not scared to go,\" the trainer said. \"If we feel like that he needs more time, we'll give it to him.\n\n\"It's all gray; there is no black and white.\"\n\nLast Sunday, during a celebratory media availability at his barn, McPeek recalled how racing Mystik Dan twice in a 13-day span as a 2-year-old \"backfired\" on him.\n\nThe horse developed a lung infection. McPeek doesn't want that to happen again, so he said there's a chance he'll scope him after this weekend's work.\n\nAs for the short turnaround for the Preakness, the trainer said it's \"not that big (of) a deal.\"\n\n\"I'm not scared to do that; so we'll see,\" he added. \"We'll let him tell us.\"\n\nBut McPeek did say, if it were up to him, he'd change the Triple Crown schedule so the second and third legs are held on the first Saturday of June and the first Saturday of July, respectively; especially considering concerns over horse safety.\n\n\"You've got to align three large organizations to agree to that, but I think that you'd get continuity for the horses,\" he said, predicting it would lead to more Kentucky Derby participants competing in all three races.\n\nOf McPeek's nine previous Kentucky Derby horses, only two have run in the Preakness -- Tejano Run (1995) and Harlan's Holiday (2002). None have carried the weight of Triple Crown aspirations like Mystik Dan, however.\n\n\"We're not taking that lightly at all,\" he said.\n\nThis year's Grade 1 Belmont Stakes will be held June 8 at Saratoga Race Course due to ongoing renovations at Belmont Park.\n\nOn Sunday, Mystik Dan co-owner Lance Gasaway told reporters the connections don't want to enter the Preakness just because.\n\n\"We want to win,\" he said.\n\nGasaway said it would be \"a big ask\" of Mystik Dan considering a majority of the horses vying to be in the field of 14 did not run in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert, whose suspension from Churchill kept him out of the Run for the Roses, could have two contenders in Baltimore. They are Muth, who won the Grade 1 Arkansas Derby in March, and Imagination, who finished second in the Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby last month.\n\nMcPeek on Wednesday said Baffert was one of roughly 2,000 people who have called or texted him since he became just the third trainer (and the first since 1952) to hit the Kentucky Oaks/Derby double last weekend.\n\n\"He was thrilled for me,\" McPeek said.\n\nWhether they square off at Pimlico is still to be determined. But with Mystik Dan, McPeek said he doesn't fear anyone -- \"even Muth.\"\n\nIt all comes down to making sure the colt is 100% ready for the challenge.\n\nWith 18-1 odds and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. aboard, Mystik Dan held off late charges from Sierra Leone and Forever Young to emerge victorious in a photo finish, the Kentucky Derby's first involving three horses since 1947, by a nose.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Mystik Dan to the Preakness Stakes?

Trainer Kenny McPeek has not committed to running Mystik Dan in the Preakness, telling the Maryland Jockey Club that he and owners would let the rest of the week play out before making a decision on the 3-year-old colt.\n\nEntries for the Preakness must be made by Monday, when the post position draw is held.\n\nIf Mystik Dan does not run in the Preakness, it will be the fifth time in six years that the race goes on without a true Triple Crown on the line, a combination of Derby circumstances, the pandemic and other factors. McPeek has expressed concern about putting the horse through another two-week turnaround, which did not work out so well in November.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That unfolding drama is a flashing sign for a sport that should be riding momentum of an epic Derby weekend.\n\nDespite much of the gloom and doom that bubbles into the narrative any time horse racing takes the national stage, last weekend was an undeniably good one for the sport.\n\nTelevision ratings for the 150th Kentucky Derby were the best since 1989, with a peak of more than 20 million people tuning in to watch the thrilling, three-horse photo finish with Mystik Dan beating Sierra Leone by a nose. The Derby drew a record $198.3 million in wagers, with nearly $320 million bet in total on the 14-race card at Churchill Downs.\n\nAnd perhaps most important of all, the week went off without any breakdowns or horse deaths, which might be coincidence but could also be evidence that new federally mandated safety protocols implemented over the last year are working. We'll see.\n\nThe bottom line is that, despite racing's decline as a major mainstream sport, people still like watching and betting on horses - particularly around days that feel like big events.\n\nBut the elation surrounding Derby Day is about to once again run into the sport's annual comedown: The Preakness.\n\nThat's not a shot at the race itself or even the notoriously dilapidated condition of Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course (more on that in a moment).\n\nIf horse racing were optimized to retain the interest of those 20 million who watched last weekend, the Preakness would be where all the storylines people learn about in the Derby end up converging: Can Mystik Dan do it again and set up a possible Triple Crown? How will Sierra Leone bounce back from a heartbreaking defeat? Will there be redemption for beaten favorite Fierceness?\n\nInstead, it's possible none of the main characters from the Derby will show up in Baltimore - including Mystik Dan, whose trainer, Ken McPeek, has been noncommittal to the point of seeming unenthusiastic about turning around just two weeks later for the Preakness.\n\n\"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me,\" McPeek told reporters Sunday. \"So we'll just watch him, and we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\"\n\nThough McPeek's tone was a bit more optimistic on Wednesday, it's not hyperbole to suggest that the Preakness becomes a sporting irrelevance if Mystik Dan doesn't show up. And it would be the second time in three years the Derby winner has skipped the second jewel of the Triple Crown, following Rich Strike's absence in 2021.\n\nRegardless of McPeek's decision, the days of horsemen automatically sending their Derby winners to Baltimore appear to be over. They're sending the Triple Crown a message. Maybe it's time the sport's stakeholders listen?\n\nFor at least 15 or 20 years, as horses run fewer races and trainers prefer to give them more time in between to recover, spacing out the Triple Crown races has been a hot topic within the industry. It became especially in vogue to bring it up during the 37-year Triple Crown drought after Affirmed in 1978, with 13 horses subsequently winning the first two legs and then coming up short in the Belmont.\n\nBut American Pharoah (2015) and Justify (2018) proved that the Triple Crown was still possible, reinforcing the idea that it should be really, really hard to join one of the most exclusive clubs in sports. For a few years, at least, talk of changing the format waned.\n\nThe question, though, shouldn't be whether the Triple Crown is too hard or too easy to win. It should be what can best sustain interest in a sport that doesn't have many big days on the national stage.\n\nIs it good for the sport that Todd Pletcher and Chad Brown, who usually come to the Derby with multiple contenders, go back to New York and wait for the Belmont? Is it good for the sport that, as of now, the only Derby horse who seems likely to run in the Preakness is 17th-place finisher Just Steel? Is it good for the sport that we could regularly have Derby winners waffling about whether it's worth trying for the Triple Crown?\n\nThough the number has always fluctuated a bit year-to-year, the 20 Preaknesses run between 1994 and 2013 included an average of 5.45 horses from the Derby. Over the last 10 years, however, that number has dropped to 3.6.\n\nLast year, only Kentucky Derby winner Mage ran in both races - and the rest of his career was plagued by physical problems until he was retired last November, having only run twice more after the Triple Crown.\n\nThough every horse is different and some handle a rigorous schedule better than others, this is why trainers have increasingly leaned toward being conservative. If they want a fresh, fit horse for big races in the summer and fall, it just doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to send them out for a 1 3/16-mile race just 14 days after a hard 1 1/4-mile race.\n\nIn talking with reporters Wednesday, McPeek even brought up the example of his first Derby starter, Tejano Run, who finished second in 1995. Two weeks later, the horse finished a dull ninth at Pimlico and wasn't heard from again until the following year.\n\n\"As a young trainer, I wish I could have a do-over,\" McPeek said. \"I wouldn't have run him.\"\n\nThere's lots of blame for this state of affairs, starting with a breeding industry that has evolved American racehorses into a weaker, less-sound animal. But pining for the days of Count Fleet and Whirlaway - who each ran in and won a race between the Preakness and Belmont in the 1940s - isn't going to change these trends.\n\nAnd Pimlico is the one paying the price, which is crucial at the moment given that the state of Maryland is set to assume ownership of the track as part of a legislative proposal that would direct $400 million in state bond money to rebuild it and make it the year-round home of Maryland racing. Without those major upgrades, the future of the Preakness being a Baltimore event would be very much up in the air.\n\nThough Maryland legislators will call it economic development, it's also a significant bet on the Preakness. But if the Preakness is no longer a race that the owners and trainers of the top 3-year-olds care about, how can you justify pouring that kind of money into it?\n\nFor the sake of the race itself, and sustaining any type of interest in the Triple Crown, it's time to finally think about spacing the races a month apart. If you ran the Derby on the first Saturday in May, the Preakness on the first Saturday in June and the Belmont on the first Saturday in July, there's no doubt more horses would run in all three.\n\n\"They should seriously consider it,\" McPeek said. \"What's the big deal on shifting it a little bit? It would be better for the sport.\"\n\nOf course, it would require Pimlico and the New York Racing Association working together to align the dates. Television networks would also have a say. Nothing in horse racing changes quickly or easily.\n\nBut the will-he-or-won't-he drama around Mystik Dan's participation is a flashing neon sign for a sport that should be riding the momentum of an epic Derby weekend.\n\nThe Preakness, and thus the Triple Crown, is in real trouble of maintaining its relevance. There's a solution that would be better for both fans and the health of the animals. It's time for horse racing to ditch tradition and do the obvious thing to fix one of its most valuable brands.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors":

Wayne Lukas, inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1999, has given the mount aboard Just Steel in the May 18 Preakness Stakes (G1) to the latest jockey elected into the Hall of Fame: Joel Rosario, whose induction ceremony is this summer.\n\nSpeaking May 9 during a National Thoroughbred Racing Association teleconference with media, Lukas expressed eagerness to run Kentucky Derby (G1) 17th-place finisher Just Steel in the second leg of the Triple Crown, as well as Seize the Grey , winner of the May 4 Pat Day Mile (G2) on the Kentucky Derby undercard. Jaime Torres will be aboard MyRacehorse's Seize the Grey, as he was when they paired for victory in the Pat Day Mile.\n\nJust Steel, owned by BC Stables and Henry Schmueckle, proved a surprising pace player in the 1 1/4-mile Derby, contesting the pace of the Rosario-ridden Track Phantom before weakening after six furlongs in 1:11.31. According to Lukas, Just Steel became aggressive under Derby jockey Keith Asmussen after being bumped at the start. The Justify colt usually races from off the pace, such as when he rallied to finish second to Muth in the Arkansas Derby (G1) last month -- beating eventual Derby winner Mystik Dan by 4 1/4 lengths.\n\nMuth is likely to start as the betting favorite in the Preakness for trainer Bob Baffert, even if trainer Kenny McPeek opts to run Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan. Baffert also intends to run Santa Anita Derby (G1) runner-up Imagination .\n\nRosario was last aboard Just Steel when the colt won the Ed Brown Stakes last fall at Churchill Downs. He was also up when Just Steel broke his maiden last summer at Saratoga Race Couse, another one of his five rides on Just Steel. He has not ridden him in his five races since the Ed Brown, all this year.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nThe Preakness is one of the few major stakes races to elude Rosario, who is winless in nine Preakness rides. Four times he has been second -- most recently on Epicenter in 2022 -- and once third aboard Creative Cause in 2012. His mount last year, late-running Red Route One , finished fourth.\n\nRosario has won the two other legs of the Triple Crown, piloting Orb to win the 2013 Kentucky Derby and Tonalist in the 2014 Belmont Stakes (G1). Lukas is a six-time Preakness winner, with his most recent success coming with the Gary Stevens-ridden Oxbow in 2013. He has 14 wins in Triple Crown races.\n\nA medium-sized field is anticipated for the 1 3/16-mile Preakness, with officials hopeful of securing a few late additions before entries are made May 13. Tuscan Gold was confirmed for the Preakness Thursday by trainer Chad Brown.\n\nLukas said his horses would travel from Churchill Downs to Pimlico Race Course, where the Preakness is contested, early next week.\n\nBesides Mystik Dan, whose status is not expected to be finalized until the weekend, the connections of Derby fourth-place finisher Catching Freedom are also taking a wait-and-see approach to the race. He races for Albaugh Family Stables. According to Jason Loutsch, a co-owner and racing manager for Albaugh Family Stables, Catching Freedom is under consideration for the Preakness and could run there or in the June 9 Matt Winn Stakes (G3) at Churchill Downs.\n\nLoutsch told Pimlico publicity by phone that the decision on the colt's racing status would be made by trainer Brad Cox. The trainer generally prefers to give his stakes competitors a month or more between starts\n\n\"We'll know something by Saturday,\" Loutsch told Pimlico publicity. \"Obviously, you'd love to run in Triple Crown races, but at the same time the horse is always first.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "byron_king@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Byron King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "D.

The Derby drew a record $198.3 million in wagers, with nearly $320 million bet in total on the 14-race card at Churchill Downs.\n\nAnd perhaps most important of all, the week went off without any breakdowns or horse deaths, which might be coincidence but could also be evidence that new federally mandated safety protocols implemented over the last year are working. We'll see.\n\nThe bottom line is that, despite racing's decline as a major mainstream sport, people still like watching and betting on horses - particularly around days that feel like big events.\n\nBut the elation surrounding Derby Day is about to once again run into the sport's annual comedown: The Preakness.\n\nThat's not a shot at the race itself or even the notoriously dilapidated condition of Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course (more on that in a moment).\n\nIf horse racing were optimized to retain the interest of those 20 million who watched last weekend, the Preakness would be where all the storylines people learn about in the Derby end up converging: Can Mystik Dan do it again and set up a possible Triple Crown? How will Sierra Leone bounce back from a heartbreaking defeat? Will there be redemption for beaten favorite Fierceness?\n\nInstead, it's possible none of the main characters from the Derby will show up in Baltimore - including Mystik Dan, whose trainer, Ken McPeek, has been noncommittal to the point of seeming unenthusiastic about turning around just two weeks later for the Preakness.\n\n\"I ran him back once in two weeks and it completely backfired on me,\" McPeek told reporters Sunday. \"So we'll just watch him, and we'll probably take it up to the last minute.\"\n\nThough McPeek's tone was a bit more optimistic on Wednesday, it's not hyperbole to suggest that the Preakness becomes a sporting irrelevance if Mystik Dan doesn't show up. And it would be the second time in three years the Derby winner has skipped the second jewel of the Triple Crown, following Rich Strike's absence in 2021.\n\nRegardless of McPeek's decision, the days of horsemen automatically sending their Derby winners to Baltimore appear to be over. They're sending the Triple Crown a message. Maybe it's time the sport's stakeholders listen?\n\nFor at least 15 or 20 years, as horses run fewer races and trainers prefer to give them more time in between to recover, spacing out the Triple Crown races has been a hot topic within the industry. It became especially in vogue to bring it up during the 37-year Triple Crown drought after Affirmed in 1978, with 13 horses subsequently winning the first two legs and then coming up short in the Belmont.\n\nBut American Pharoah (2015) and Justify (2018) proved that the Triple Crown was still possible, reinforcing the idea that it should be really, really hard to join one of the most exclusive clubs in sports. For a few years, at least, talk of changing the format waned.\n\nThe question, though, shouldn't be whether the Triple Crown is too hard or too easy to win. It should be what can best sustain interest in a sport that doesn't have many big days on the national stage.\n\nIs it good for the sport that Todd Pletcher and Chad Brown, who usually come to the Derby with multiple contenders, go back to New York and wait for the Belmont? Is it good for the sport that, as of now, the only Derby horse who seems likely to run in the Preakness is 17th-place finisher Just Steel? Is it good for the sport that we could regularly have Derby winners waffling about whether it's worth trying for the Triple Crown?\n\nThough the number has always fluctuated a bit year-to-year, the 20 Preaknesses run between 1994 and 2013 included an average of 5.45 horses from the Derby. Over the last 10 years, however, that number has dropped to 3.6.\n\nLast year, only Kentucky Derby winner Mage ran in both races - and the rest of his career was plagued by physical problems until he was retired last November, having only run twice more after the Triple Crown.\n\nThough every horse is different and some handle a rigorous schedule better than others, this is why trainers have increasingly leaned toward being conservative. If they want a fresh, fit horse for big races in the summer and fall, it just doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to send them out for a 1 3/16-mile race just 14 days after a hard 1 1/4-mile race.\n\nIn talking with reporters Wednesday, McPeek even brought up the example of his first Derby starter, Tejano Run, who finished second in 1995. Two weeks later, the horse finished a dull ninth at Pimlico and wasn't heard from again until the following year.\n\n\"As a young trainer, I wish I could have a do-over,\" McPeek said. \"I wouldn't have run him.\"\n\nThere's lots of blame for this state of affairs, starting with a breeding industry that has evolved American racehorses into a weaker, less-sound animal. But pining for the days of Count Fleet and Whirlaway - who each ran in and won a race between the Preakness and Belmont in the 1940s - isn't going to change these trends.\n\nAnd Pimlico is the one paying the price, which is crucial at the moment given that the state of Maryland is set to assume ownership of the track as part of a legislative proposal that would direct $400 million in state bond money to rebuild it and make it the year-round home of Maryland racing. Without those major upgrades, the future of the Preakness being a Baltimore event would be very much up in the air.\n\nThough Maryland legislators will call it economic development, it's also a significant bet on the Preakness. But if the Preakness is no longer a race that the owners and trainers of the top 3-year-olds care about, how can you justify pouring that kind of money into it?\n\nFor the sake of the race itself, and sustaining any type of interest in the Triple Crown, it's time to finally think about spacing the races a month apart. If you ran the Derby on the first Saturday in May, the Preakness on the first Saturday in June and the Belmont on the first Saturday in July, there's no doubt more horses would run in all three.\n\n\"They should seriously consider it,\" McPeek said. \"What's the big deal on shifting it a little bit? It would be better for the sport.\"\n\nOf course, it would require Pimlico and the New York Racing Association working together to align the dates. Television networks would also have a say. Nothing in horse racing changes quickly or easily.\n\nBut the will-he-or-won't-he drama around Mystik Dan's participation is a flashing neon sign for a sport that should be riding the momentum of an epic Derby weekend.\n\nThe Preakness, and thus the Triple Crown, is in real trouble of maintaining its relevance.

Trainer Kenny McPeek has not committed to running Mystik Dan in the Preakness, telling the Maryland Jockey Club that he and owners would let the rest of the week play out before making a decision on the 3-year-old colt.\n\nEntries for the Preakness must be made by Monday, when the post position draw is held.\n\nIf Mystik Dan does not run in the Preakness, it will be the fifth time in six years that the race goes on without a true Triple Crown on the line, a combination of Derby circumstances, the pandemic and other factors. McPeek has expressed concern about putting the horse through another two-week turnaround, which did not work out so well in November.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby in a photo finish and now his connections are considering a run at the Preakness Stakes 2024 and a shot at a Triple Crown bid. The 2024 Preakness Stakes odds list Mystik Dan at 3-1.With four professional wins under his belt, the Bob Baffert-trained Muth, who didn't run at Churchill Downs, is the 11-10 favorite among the 2024 Preakness Stakes horses.\n\nThe other 2024 Preakness Stakes contenders getting single-digit odds are Tuscan Gold (5-1) and Imagination, both at 5-1. Before making any 2024 Preakness Stakes picks, be sure to see the horse racing predictions and futures bets from SportsLine's elite horse racing expert Jody Demling by joining SportsLine using your free CBS Sports account.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Kentucky Derby having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Preakness Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 19 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023. He keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby winner was poised for victory or a massive upset in the second leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2024 Preakness Stakes futures already on the board, Demling is sharing his picks and 2024 Preakness Stakes predictions over at SportsLine. Join SportsLine using your CBS Sports account to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Preakness Stakes predictions\n\nOne of Demling's surprising 2024 Preakness Stakes picks: He is high on Tuscan Gold, even though he's a 5-1 longshot that didn't run in the Kentucky Derby. Tuscan Golf doesn't have much of a track record. The Chad Brown-trained colt has run in just three career races, and only one of those was a graded-stakes event.\n\nHowever, Demling was impressed with that run, a third-place finish at the Louisiana Derby in which he finished behind only Honor Marie and Catching Freedom, both top-eight finishers at the Kentucky Derby. Tuscan Gold won his previous race, a Maiden Special Weight race at Gulfstream Park, so while his resume is short, he's done enough to be considered in 2024 Preakness Stakes bets. \"He's good enough to get a piece against this field,\" Demling told SportsLine.

The Middle Leg of the Triple Crown will take place in mid-May, with several potential newcomers who overlooked the Derby set to take their chance.\n\nHowever, the most attention will be on the winner of the famous race at Churchill Downs, as Mystik Dan will look to join the plethora of greats by winning multiple legs of the Triple Crown series. But, can the Kenneth McPeek runner land success in the Preakness Stakes?\n\nA stunning edition of the Kentucky Derby saw a finish deserving of the 150th renewal of the race, with Mystik Dan holding off late challenges from Sierra Leone and Forever Young to win the Triple Crown race by a nose.\n\nIt was a stunning performance by the three-year-old for Kenneth McPeek, and was a boost to the G1 Arkansas Derby form, where the Derby winner finished third behind Muth. Mystik Dan will now have the opportunity to join some of the most famous runners in racing history if deciding to line up in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nHowever, connections have poured cold water on the dreams of seeing a Triple Crown winner crowned this year, with McPeek teasing that his star runner could opt to overlook a date at Pimlico in favor of a tilt in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe trainer revealed after the Derby that his star was tired following his gutsy run, and he will likely need time to recover before returning to the track.\n\nMcPeek revealed that a racecourse gallop on May 8 will ultimately determine what decision will be made, but the Belmont Stakes over a reduced distance of 1 \u00bc miles could make the Derby winner a standout contender at Saratoga next month.\n\nThe fact that the Belmont Stakes will be run over a reduced distance at Saratoga this year means that it's likely that a lot of Derby runners will travel straight to the final Triple Crown race in 2024.\n\nSierra Leone was only narrowly denied a dream win in the Derby for trainer Chad Brown, and connections have already made it clear that they will overlook the 2024 Preakness Stakes odds in favor of a tilt at the final race of the series.\n\nIn fact, Brown has already moved Sierra Leone to Saratoga ahead of the Belmont Stakes, and connections will be extremely hopeful of a strong run after a layoff this year given his strong run to the line at Churchill Downs.\n\nJapanese raider Forever Young was third in the Derby, but both he and fellow raider T O Password will travel back to Asia this week.\n\nHonor Marie had no shortage of traffic issues in the Derby, but connections have already admitted that they will be going straight to the Belmont, with West Saratoga also set to be an intended runner at Saratoga next month.\n\nMage was the only Derby runner involved in the Preakness Stakes last year, and it looks set to be the same again for the middle leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nMystik Dan could be the only Derby runner to take his chance in the Preakness, meaning that the entirety of the field could be made up of new shooters looking to score in the Triple Crown series.\n\nMuth is expected to go off very short at Pimlico for last year's winning connections after previously getting the better of Mystik Dan to land the G1 Arkansas Derby. That was the Bob Baffert runner's second straight victory this season, and it could be argued that he is already the most talented three-year-old in the U.S. this year.\n\nBaffert is also likely to saddle Imagination in the Preakness this year. The three-year-old was narrowly beaten by a neck by Stronghold in the G1 Santa Anita Derby in April, while he was a winner over an extended mile when capturing the G2 San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita in early March.\n\nOne of the most fascinating runners that could line up at Pimlico is D. Wayne Lukas-trained Seize The Grey. The three-year-old colt was incredibly impressive on the Derby undercard when beating Nash by over a length in the G3 Pat Day Mile.\n\nHe has already recorded victory over longer than a mile and has form intertwined with Derby contenders such as Sierra Leone after finishing seventh in the G1 Blue Grass.\n\nTuscan Gold is also a potential runner for trainer Chad Brown after finishing third in the G2 Louisiana Derby on his comeback effort at Fair Grounds. However, connections could yet target the G3 Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct instead.", "source": {"uri": "thepresstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roseville Press-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carol_e_schumacher@thepresstribune.com", "name": "Carol E.

In Session 2024, the General Assembly agreed to a revised version of a bill to redevelop Pimlico and its surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nPost time for the Preakness is approximately 6:50 p.m. on May 18.\n\nWBAL-TV 11's live coverage of the Preakness starts with 11 News Saturday Morning at 5 a.m., followed by a live special presentation starting at 1 p.m. that's followed by NBC Sports coverage at 4:30 p.m. Then, WBAL-TV 11 News airs a special newscast after the race.\n\nTickets for Preakness are available for purchase online here. Depending on availability, a limited amount of tickets will be available on the day of the event at Pimlico.

Harlow was named the \"Top New Artist\" at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards and is known for his hit songs \"Lovin on Me,\" \"First Class\" and \"What's Poppin.\"\n\nOther performers include Channel Tres, Chantel Jefferies, Frank Walker and Gryffin.

He controlled the rail for much of the back half of the race, using that position to surge ahead of the pack around the bend and ultimately win.\n\nThat's a tough approach to replicate, pending post position, and could be especially challenging for a horse who will potentially be showing signs of fatigue if he does run.\n\nThen, of course, if he does win, he'll have just three more weeks to recover before a potential Triple Crown clincher at the Belmont Stakes in Saratoga.\n\nFor an underdog horse who won the Kentucky Derby with a daring strategy by the shortest margin possible, and is already showing signs of slowing down, two more wins seem out of reach.\n\nThese long odds are warranted, and likely not worth an investment, even if Mystik Dan does run at Pimlico Race Course.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimlico_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pimlico Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/mystic-dan-triple-crown-e1715273865645.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543530", "eventUri": "eng-9543530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 579, "textEnd": 585}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Once the colt had passed by the viewing stand where McPeek could see him, he turned around and put in an easy 1 1/8-mile gallop to stretch his legs.\n\n\"He was his old self. He just goes out there as Mr. Pro,\" McPeek said.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nMcPeek is carefully monitoring every movement the colt makes as he weighs whether or not his Derby winner will pursue racing's Triple Crown with a start in the $2 million Preakness Stakes (G1) May 18 at Pimlico Race Course.\n\nThe routine performed by Mystik Dan Wednesday morning was specifically designed to make sure McPeek could watch Mystik Dan jog away from him, jog past him one time, and gallop past McPeek twice while he watched in the viewing stand with his dog, Sunny.\n\n\"More than anything, I want to make sure he's moving good, eating good and happy,\" McPeek said. \"At this stage, I like what I see.\"\n\nA decision on the Preakness will likely not come until this weekend, and McPeek said it might not come until May 13, the day of entries.\n\n\"An old guy told me a long time ago, never make a decision until you absolutely, positively have to,\" McPeek said.\n\nMystik Dan will stretch his gallop out to 1 3/8 miles beginning May 9 and may have a \"swift gallop\" May 11 to give McPeek a chance to scope the colt, making sure there are no issues in his trachea or lungs.\n\nMystik Dan won a maiden race Nov. 12 at Churchill Downs by 7 3/4 lengths. Returning just 13 days later as the favorite in an allowance optional claiming race, Mystik Dan ran fifth while beaten by eight lengths. McPeek said his runner came out of the race with a lung infection.\n\n\"I don't want that to happen again,\" McPeek said when asked about the two weeks between the Derby and Preakness. \"He had a real legitimate excuse. He coughed up a big chunk of mucus.\"\n\nDespite that concerning performance on short rest last fall, McPeek is comfortable running Mystik Dan in the Preakness as long as he's healthy.\n\n\"It's not that big a deal,\" McPeek said. \"As long as their immune systems are good and they're happy, no problem.\"\n\nThorpedo Anna Returns To Track Despite Rash\n\nWhile all signs are positive for Mystik Dan, McPeek has more to worry about for the stable's other star, Kentucky Oaks (G1) winner Thorpedo Anna .\n\n\"She came out of the race with a little bit of a skin rash on her girth that's got me concerned,\" McPeek said. \"Horses get ringworm, it's from the humidity, the weather, the rain and stuff like that. Every now and then you get a stable that has a little case of ringworm. She's got some spots on her girth.\"\n\nDespite the rash, the daughter of Fast Anna also made her first trip back to the track Wednesday morning, performing the same routine as her Derby-winning stablemate. McPeek said she was still showing the same aggressiveness she always does during her training.\n\nNot expecting the rash to cause any delays, McPeek seemed committed to the June 7 Acorn Stakes (G1) at Saratoga Race Course rather than the following day's Belmont Stakes (G1) against the boys.\n\n\"I want her to be champion 3-year-old filly,\" McPeek said.\n\nPreakness Field Slowly Taking Shape\n\nShould Mystik Dan decide to run in the Preakness, he will likely only see one familiar Derby face in the gate, Just Steel . Trained by D. Wayne Lukas, the son of Justify also returned to the track Wednesday alongside Lukas' Pat Day Mile (G2) winner and Preakness hopeful Seize the Grey .\n\n\"They had good energy, felt good. In fact, surprisingly good,\" Lukas said. \"I was very pleased with them. We passed that part of the test pretty good.\"\n\nSitting within a half length off Derby pacesetter Track Phantom , Just Steel chased fractions of :22.97 and :46.63 before fading to 17th. Based on his energy levels after the Derby, Lukas believes the colt will be ready to bounce back with a more favorable trip.\n\n\"You can't (set those fractions) in the Derby and finish,\" Lukas said. \"We got roughed up a little leaving there. I don't blame (jockey) Keith (Asmussen) because he tried to get out of that trouble. In doing so, he ended up sending him. We were just too strong early.\"\n\nSitting on the also-eligible list prior to Derby entries being taken, Lukas decided to audible Seize the Grey to the Pat Day Mile. The move proved successful as the son of Arrogate took home the top prize.\n\nSeize the Grey seemed to relish the cut-back in distance to a one-turn mile, but Lukas is not concerned asking him to stretch back out to the 1 3/16-mile distance of the Preakness.\n\n\"He was just getting his stride at the wire. He was running pretty strong,\" Lukas said. \"I really think that he'll adapt to the Preakness very well. He's the type of horse that will be very well adapted to it.\"\n\nLukas has not made a decision yet on who will ride Just Steel in the Preakness, but confirmed Jaime Torres will retain the mount on Seize the Grey.\n\nA horse that was on the Derby also-eligible list was Mugatu . After failing to get enough scratches to enter the classic, trainer Jeff Engler changed his back-up plan from running in the May 11 Peter Pan Stakes (G3) at Aqueduct Racetrack to running in the Triple Crown's middle jewel.\n\n\"We were a little frustrated we didn't get into the Derby,\" Engler said. \"We feel the more distance the better for this horse. I do like the mile and three-sixteenths, so we're going to head up.\"\n\nMugatu was likely to be the Derby's biggest longshot had he drawn in, given he has won just once in twelve starts. However, in a smaller field in the Preakness, he is likely to receive more attention. On April 6, the son of Blofeld closed from last to finish fifth in the Blue Grass Stakes (G1) behind four Kentucky Derby contenders, and ahead of Seize the Grey. The Blue Grass was his first start on dirt since Dec. 9 and only his third start on the surface in his career.\n\n\"He's getting better. He really moved up on the dirt. His numbers proved it,\" Engler said. \"We finished in front of (Seize the Grey) in the Blue Grass. I heard Seize the Grey is going in the Preakness, so it's a logical spot.\"\n\nThe main intrigue in the Preakness field is the Bob Baffert-trained duo of Arkansas Derby (G1) winner Muth and San Felipe Stakes (G2) winner Imagination . Both horses would have qualified for the Derby, but were ineligible to run due to Baffert's suspension from Churchill Downs following a failed drug test that disqualified Medina Spirit from victory in the 2021 Kentucky Derby.\n\nMuth will enter the Preakness off seven weeks rest while Imagination has not raced in six weeks. Lukas believes the two colts waiting fresh in the wings has weighed on the Preakness decisions for many trainers. However, neither he nor McPeek have been swayed by Baffert's presence.\n\n\"I don't fear any (fresh horses), even Muth,\" McPeek said. \"We're in good shape. I don't worry about other people's horses. It's hard to train mine, much less everyone else's.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_collins@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Sean Collins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "D.

Kenny McPeek provides update on Kentucky Derby 150 winner", "body": "Kenny McPeek is still mulling whether he'll enter Kentucky Derby 150 winner Mystik Dan in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nA decision could come as early as this weekend or as late as Monday, before post positions are drawn at 5:30 p.m. for the $2 million, Grade 1 race on May 18 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. It hinges on how the son of Goldencents is moving and eating.\n\n\"An old guy told me a long time ago, 'Never make a decision until you absolutely, positively have to,'\" the trainer said Wednesday morning, after Mystik Dan worked at Churchill Downs for the first time since the Run for the Roses.\n\n\"I know that's frustrating for you all -- you want me to decide now -- but what if I change my mind?\" he added. \"I really don't usually make a decision on any horse that I train until I open the condition book.\"\n\nMystik Dan jogged a mile and galloped a little more than a mile Wednesday morning. McPeek said the horse is \"doing great\" and will likely gallop 1 3/8 miles Thursday, Friday and Saturday before a decision is made regarding the Preakness.\n\nLast Sunday, during a celebratory media availability at his barn, McPeek recalled how racing Mystik Dan twice in a 13-day span as a 2-year-old \"backfired\" on him.\n\nThe horse developed a lung infection.

The American Thoroughbred was caught on video resting with his garland of roses from last weekend's race, and we can all agree that he certainly deserves the rest.\n\nDan won the race by a snout against Sierra Leone and Forever Young in a photo-finish.\n\nUnderstandably, the American Thoroughbred would be just a little tired after all that work. The video from the Kentucky Derby's TikTok page shows the horse sleeping in his stall with his rose garland nearby.\n\nRelated: Horses' Reaction to Hearing the Races Going on Is Just Too Cute\n\n\"Rest up Mystik Dan! Preakness is in 12 days!\" they joked in the video's caption, referring to the Preakness Stakes competition in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nBut in Mystik Dan's defense he already brought the horse racing world to its knees by winning the Kentucky Derby. To say that he wasn't favored to win isn't an understatement. Before heading to Louisville, Dan had a relatively thin resume. He came in third at the Arkansas Derby and won at the Grade III Southwest Stakes, NBC News reports.\n\nOn the morning of the Kentucky Derby, Dan was listed with 20-1 odds. But people had a little more faith in the horse and ultimately bet him down to 18-1 by the start of the race. It wasn't clear that Dan was going to win, but he delivered. The Thoroughbred stormed the course in 2:03.34. In comparison, the 3-1 favorite, Fierceness, came in fifteenth.\n\nThis win earned his trainer Kenny McPeek a career Triple Crown win.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if we had won,\" jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. explained to the news outlet. \"So it was quite a rush to sit here and wait for it.\"\n\n\"Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, jockey and ride,\" McPeek praised. \"Brian's amazing.\"\n\nOnline people praised Mystik Dan for a job well done. \"I love that Mystik Dan had a 20-1 chance and he still came out on top!\" one person exclaimed. \"Post competition naps just hit so much different,\" another commenter joked. \"The most earned nap of the weekend!!\" a third person praised. \"Sweet dreams, Champ,\" chimed in another commenter.\n\nHernandez is part of a legacy of horse riding. His father was a jockey, as are his two siblings. He told the news outlet that he's wanted to be a jockey for a longtime.

Team USA remains stacked with talent, including Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and others. Durant's injury is classified as minor, with hopes of him joining the team for the Olympics.\n\nWith many teams around the world scratching and clawing to earn an Olympic berth, Team USA is already busy preparing for Paris by holding training camp in Las Vegas. However, while Team USA is stacked with superstars, they will be without arguably the best player on the roster early on, with a recent report from Shams Charania and Joe Vardon of The Athletic indicating Kevin Durant will miss the start of training camp because of a calf injury.\n\n\"We're just going to use an abundance of caution. It's not bad. He's assuring me it's not bad. We're just going to be really careful and take it day by day.\" - Steve Kerr\n\nThe Phoenix Suns' All-Star finished the 2023-24 campaign by averaging 27.1 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 1.2 blocks while shooting 41.3 percent from behind the arc. While those numbers are remarkable, what's more impressive is that Durant appeared in 75 games during the regular season, his most since 2018-19 while he was still a member of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nFortunately, Durant's ailment has been classified as \"minor,\" so there isn't any real concern he won't be in the lineup when Team USA opens up their quest for gold against Serbia on July 28. Still, Durant's health will be monitored closely heading toward the Olympics.\n\nTeam USA Is Stacked Even if Durant Misses The Olympics, Team USA Has Plenty of Talent\n\nFor now, there's a good chance Team USA's all-time leading scorer won't be available against Canada in an exhibition contest on Wednesday. But even if Durant can't play, teams have time before final rosters must be submitted, meaning there's still hope he'll be ready to roll when the Olympics commence in Paris in just a few short weeks.\n\nRest assured, even without Durant, Team USA isn't short of talent. The club features other future Hall of Famers like Stephen Curry and LeBron James. In addition, guys like Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum will be mainstays in the NBA for years to come.\n\nAnd as discouraging as Durant's injury is, there have been some positive developments.\n\nJoel Embiid, who was limited to only 39 games in 2023-24, has been practicing. The same is true for Kawhi Leonard, who battled a knee injury of his own throughout the postseason.\n\nWith that said, Team USA is still a favorite without Durant, although America's chances of winning a gold medal will significantly decrease without him.\n\nRelated Anthony Edwards Believes He's the 'Number One Option' on Team USA\n\nDespite being loaded with talent, Anthony Edwards believes he's the main option on Team USA.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-07-jul-2024-09-03-pm-2740.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 1437, "textEnd": 1444}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The greatness of the players around him is sinking in, with Embiid using Stephen Curry as an example of a generational talent who has made the game much easier for him on the national team.\n\n\"When you play with some of the greatest players of all time, it's fun. You gotta adjust, you gotta learn how to play. Everybody here has a high basketball IQ, so it's easy. When you play with someone like Steph, all you gotta do is free him up and he's either going to be wide-open or attack and make space for me and everybody else. The same thing with LeBron. It's really fun, and myself too, I'm trying to make it easy for them.\"\n\nEmbiid announced his intention to play for Team USA at the 2024 Olympics last October, with Fadeaway World getting Rudy Gobert's live reaction to the news after he and other members of France tried recruiting Embiid to represent their country at Paris 2024.\n\nJoel has had the luxury of playing alongside some of the best talents in the NBA, but nothing to the caliber of what he's seeing around him at Team USA. The top names on the roster are NBA legends who will be remembered as among the greatest of all time, especially LeBron James and Stephen Curry, who are both considered to be top-10 all-time players.\n\nEmbiid averaged 34.7 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 5.6 assists last season, struggling to stay healthy and playing just 39 games on the year. He's healthy for Team USA where he's expected to be the team's starting center ahead of options like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo.\n\nTeam USA Has A Colorful Group Of Characters\n\nThe 2024 Team USA team might not have a catchy nickname like the Dream Team or the Redeem Team, even though many have called this squad the 'Avengers.' This is among the greatest on-paper rosters Team USA has ever put together, with bonafide Hall of Famers in the mix along with future superstars who will be expected to carry the USA project by the time the 2028 Olympics rolls around.\n\nAlong with legends like Steph, LeBron, and Kevin Durant, the team has veteran superstars such as Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard, along with recent NBA Champions Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday. Funnily, the last time Holiday won a title was also in an Olympic year, with him playing a crucial role in helping the USA seal Gold.\n\nAnthony Edwards is among the most fascinating characters in the NBA today. He has already made bold public statements such as declaring himself as Team USA's no. 1 option while not even having locked down a starting spot. At the same time, he's deferring to legends like Durant because of the respect he has for them.\n\nEmbiid is fulfilling a lifelong dream by representing Team USA at the biggest stage of international basketball; The Olympics.

LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry form a dynamic trio of leaders that will bring on board a crew including Joel Embiid, Anthony Edwards, and Anthony Davis. Team USA has enough star power to be named the favorites in the 2024 Olympics and time will tell if they can get over the line and destroy the competition en route to the gold medal. Before the Americans get their Olympics started, it is time to divide all 12 players into four different tiers.\n\nUpdate: Kawhi Leonard withdraws from Team USA for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe Biggest Stars\n\nLeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry\n\nThe presence of LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry on the 2024 Team USA roster brings together three of the most iconic players in modern basketball. LeBron James, at the age of 39, is aiming to secure his third gold medal, which would tie him with Carmelo Anthony for the second-most golds in USA Basketball history. His leadership and all-around game will be crucial for the team, providing a stabilizing force on and off the court.\n\nKevin Durant, already a three-time gold medalist, has the unique opportunity to become the first player in history to win four Olympic gold medals in basketball. His scoring prowess and versatility make him a constant threat and a cornerstone for Team USA's offensive schemes. Stephen Curry, seeking his first Olympic gold, brings unmatched shooting ability and playmaking skills that can break open any game, making this trio a formidable foundation for the team's success.\n\nLeBron, Durant, and Curry are not just seasoned veterans; they are transcendent talents who have dominated the NBA for over a decade. Their collective experience and basketball IQ are unparalleled, offering Team USA a blend of leadership, skill, and competitive spirit that few teams in the world can match. While all three are in the latter stages of their careers, their motivation to add to their legacies with another Olympic gold will be a driving force. This trio's ability to elevate their teammates and perform in high-pressure situations makes them invaluable assets as Team USA aims for gold in Paris.\n\nPerfect Roles\n\nAnthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Derrick White\n\nAnthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White are perfectly suited for their roles on Team USA, providing balance and complementing the star power around them. Anthony Davis, a dominant force on both ends of the court, will benefit from his established chemistry with LeBron James and the elite scorers around him. Davis's ability to protect the rim, run the floor, and finish plays makes him an indispensable part of the team, particularly in transition and defensive setups.\n\nJrue Holiday, one of the best defensive guards in the league, fits seamlessly into Team USA's lineup as a utility player. His ability to play lockdown defense against opposing guards and wings, combined with his playmaking skills, makes him a valuable asset in various lineups. Holiday's unselfish play and versatility allow him to blend well with the stars around him, providing stability and support both on and off the ball.\n\nDerrick White, the strongest candidate to replace Kawhi Leonard, is a similar type of player to Jrue Holiday in terms of playing defense, moving the ball, and using his championship experience this year with the Celtics to help Team USA. White won't be unhappy with not receiving much of the plaudits or minutes and can do an exceptional role off the bench.\n\nTogether, Davis, Holiday, and White form a core that enhances Team USA's defensive tenacity and complements the offensive firepower of their superstar teammates.\n\nRelated: Team USA vs. France: 2024 Olympics (Analysis, Advantages, Who Is Better?)\n\nMust Prove Themselves\n\nJayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker\n\nJayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Joel Embiid, and Devin Booker come into the 2024 Olympics with something to prove. Tatum, despite being a key player for the Boston Celtics, needs to demonstrate that he can be a true superstar on the international stage and lead Team USA to success.\n\nAnthony Edwards, after a disappointing fourth-place finish in the 2023 FIBA World Cup, faces pressure to show that he is an elite player capable of performing under the brightest lights. His explosive scoring and athleticism will be crucial, but consistency and leadership will determine his impact on the team.\n\nJoel Embiid, who recently chose to represent Team USA after gaining citizenship, must validate his decision and earn his place on the roster amid some skepticism after there were rumors he would join France. His dominant presence in the paint and ability to stretch the floor can be game-changing, but he needs to prove that he can stay healthy and adapt to the international game.\n\nDevin Booker, a gold medalist from the 2020 Olympics, has the task of solidifying his status as the best shooting guard in the NBA. With competition from Anthony Edwards for minutes, Booker must showcase his scoring ability and defensive improvements to maintain his role and contribute significantly to the team's success.\n\nHappy To Be Here\n\nBam Adebayo, Tyrese Haliburton\n\nBam Adebayo and Tyrese Haliburton are integral parts of Team USA, even if they are not the primary stars. Adebayo, known for his defensive prowess and high basketball IQ, will provide crucial depth behind Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid. His versatility in defending multiple positions and ability to facilitate offense from the center position makes him a valuable asset, even if he isn't the first option. Adebayo will relish the opportunity to go for his second gold medal (his first in 2020), contributing wherever needed and supporting the team's defensive efforts.\n\nTyrese Haliburton, coming off a fourth-place finish in the 2023 World Cup, is eager to prove he can perform on the biggest stage. His playmaking ability, combined with his efficient scoring, makes him a versatile guard who can fit in various lineups. While he may not be the focal point, Haliburton's contributions will be vital in ensuring Team USA's depth and cohesion throughout the tournament.\n\nTeam USA Is Primed For A Sweep Of The Competition En Route To Gold\n\nTeam USA enters the 2024 Olympics as the overwhelming favorite to not only win the gold medal but to do so in a dominant fashion, reminiscent of the legendary 1992 Dream Team. With an elite mix of superstar power, including LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry, the team boasts an unparalleled level of talent and experience. These veterans, driven by the prospect of one final gold medal before they retire, provide leadership and a winning mentality that is crucial for success on the international stage.\n\nThe roster's depth is further bolstered by the perfect role players like Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White who offer defensive prowess and versatility. The addition of Joel Embiid, alongside rising stars like Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards, ensures that Team USA has no weaknesses. While formidable opponents such as Serbia, Greece, France, and Canada present strong challenges, Team USA's comprehensive advantages in skill, experience, and depth make them the team to beat. With all elements in place, Team USA is primed for a flawless run to Olympic gold.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Voted As Best Player At Team USA\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

He'd Bring LeBron James, Curry, Durant Off Bench for USA", "body": "USA Basketball and NBA legend Carmelo Anthony gave a unique and unexpected answer when asked who he would start if he was in charge of Team USA at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn an interview with Overtime, Melo said he would go with a young starting lineup comprised of Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum and Devin Booker:\n\nAnthony noted that doing so would allow for established veterans such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry and Jrue Holiday to contribute off the bench.\n\nThe United States men's basketball team for the 2024 Summer Games is arguably more stacked than it has been in quite some time due in large part to James and Curry returning to the squad after opting not to participate in the 2020 Olympics.\n\nAdditionally, Embiid chose to compete for Team USA over both Cameroon and France, plus some youthful exuberance has been injected into the team in the form of Haliburton and Edwards.\n\nThis year marks the first time that James, Curry and Durant have all played together on Team USA in the Olympics.\n\nThat is monumental given that they are arguably the three best players of their era, as all of them have won NBA MVP and NBA Finals MVP awards, while combining for 10 NBA championships between them.\n\nMemorably, James' Cleveland Cavaliers and Curry's Golden State Warriors clashed in the NBA Finals four straight years from 2015 to 2018.\n\nCurry and the Dubs won the first one, James and the Cavs won the second, and then the Warriors won the next two with Durant being named NBA Finals MVP both years.\n\nIt is difficult to envision Warriors and Team USA head coach Steve Kerr bringing James, Curry and Durant off the bench given his respect for LeBron and his experience coaching both Steph and KD.\n\nOf course, Team USA's roster is so stacked that it doesn't necessarily matter who starts or who comes off the bench since all 12 team members figure to get plenty of playing time.\n\nMelo is arguably the greatest Team USA performer of all time with three Olympic gold medals and one Olympic bronze medal to his credit, plus the all-time scoring and rebounding records for the U.S. at the Olympics.\n\nThat means his opinion carries some weight, but given Kerr's five NBA titles as a player and four NBA titles as a head coach, it stands to reason that he'll be able to press the right buttons in his own right.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Team USA will be in Group C, along with Serbia, Puerto Rico and South Sudan. Even with the United States already being heavily favored to win gold in Paris, that is made even easier by the group of opponents they'll face in the first stage before the knockout rounds.\n\nThe United States automatically qualified for the Paris Olympics by finishing as one of the top two countries in the Americas zone at the FIBA World Cup last summer. Team USA finished fourth after losing the bronze medal match against Canada. It was a shocking finish for the American men's team, and no doubt led to an increased interest in competing in the 2024 Olympics by top American talent in the NBA.\n\nIt led to perhaps the most stacked roster for Team USA in quite some time, but with that comes outsized expectations, too. The men's tournament begins on July 27, with Team USA taking the court for the first time on July 2. But prior to that, the United States will take part in a USA Basketball Showcase from July 10-22, where they team will play against five different countries as a tune-up for the Olympics. It'll feature matchups against Canada, Australia, Serbia, South Sudan and Germany.\n\nTeam USA will be led by Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, as well as Gonzaga head coach Mark Few, Clippers coach Ty Lue and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra as assistants.\n\nAs we get closer to the start of the Olympics, here's all the information you need to know about Team USA's roster, schedule and an outlook for the defending world champions.\n\nTeam USA roster PlayerPositionNBA team\n\nBam Adebayo\n\nCenter\n\nMiami Heat\n\nDevin Booker\n\nGuard\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nStephen Curry\n\nGuard\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nAnthony Davis\n\nForward/Center\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nKevin Durant\n\nForward\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nAnthony Edwards\n\nGuard\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nCenter\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nTyrese Haliburton\n\nGuard\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nGuard\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nLeBron James\n\nForward\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nKawhi Leonard\n\nForward\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nForward\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nTeam USA Basketball Showcase scheduleOpponentDateTime (EST)LocationTV/Streaming\n\nCanada\n\nJuly 10\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nLas Vegas\n\nFS1/fubo\n\nAustralia\n\nJuly 15\n\n12 p.m.\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nFS1/fubo\n\nSerbia\n\nJuly 17\n\n12 p.m.\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nFS1/fubo\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nJuly 20\n\n3 p.m.\n\nLondon\n\nFOX/fubo\n\nGermany\n\nJuly 22\n\n3 p.m.\n\nLondon\n\nFOX/fubo\n\nTeam USA 2024 Olympics scheduleOpponentDateTime (EST)Phase\n\nSerbia\n\nJuly 28\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nGroup stage\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nJuly 31\n\n3 p.m.\n\nGroup stage\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nAug. 3\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nGroup stageTBDAug. 6TBDQuarterfinalsTBDAug. 8TBDSemifinalsTBDAug. 10TBDGold/Bronze Medal gamesTeam USA outlook\n\nThe United States has won 16 gold medals at the Olympics, and has captured nothing less than gold since 2004. The Americans enter every Olympic Games as the heavy favorites, and for good reason. They field the best players every four years, and despite putting together a team on a short timespan they still typically manage to bulldoze the competition every four years. But Team USA isn't infallible. In each of the two last FIBA World Cup appearances, the U.S. failed to medal, placing fourth last summer and an even more shocking seventh-place finish in 2019. Granted, those teams did not boast the best talent the United States has to offer, but it's proof that you can't just throw anyone out there with hopes of beating the rest of the world.\n\nBut the 2024 Olympic roster is perhaps the best collection of talent the United States has fielded since the 2008 Redeem Team, which was built to avenge a bronze medal finish at the 2004 Games. We'll get Stephen Curry in his first Olympics ever. Probably the last Olympic appearance from LeBron James, the debut of Joel Embiid, who Team USA was hotly recruiting to join instead of going with France or Cameroon. And peppered in there is a nice blend of older talent like Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis, mixed with the next generation of American stars like Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nHowever, the field at the 2024 Olympics features some of the best international players that will all be chomping at the bit to try and knock the Americans off. Canada has the second-best collection of NBA talent behind the United States, and could very well meet the U.S. in the gold medal match. The same is true of France, which will have Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert patrolling the frontcourt. Even in Team USA's own group, the team will have to face reigning NBA MVP Nikola Jokic and Serbia, which finished second at last summer's World Cup. And then there's Puerto Rico, which earned a berth to the Olympics for the first time since 2004. The last time Puerto Rico were there, the country handed Team USA a shocking loss in the group stage, which sent the Americans on a spiral that resulted in a bronze medal finish.\n\nThe Americans will certainly be favored in every matchup, but they can't afford to take any opponent lightly as there's NBA players on nearly every roster heading to Paris. The biggest weakness for Team USA will be figuring out how to play together on both sides of the floor. They have training camp and five tune-up games to build chemistry, but it's always a little clunky when you have 12 guys who are not used to playing together.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com",

Picking out a starting five is a tough but important task.\n\nPure talent isn't enough to win international competitions anymore. The rest of the world has closed the gap on America. Look no further than last summer's FIBA World Cup, where Team USA finished in fourth place despite bringing All-Stars like Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson.\n\nFinding the group that fits the best together will determine how far Team USA goes in this tournament. Here is their best starting five.\n\nMORE: Why Kawhi Leonard is withdrawing from Team USA for the Olympics\n\nCurry should be one of the first guys who makes it into the starting lineup. This is his first chance at playing for an Olympic gold, but there shouldn't be much of an adjustment period for him. He's the best shooter in the world, and that will translate to any level of basketball. He's also very familiar with the sets that coach Steve Kerr will install.\n\nHoliday isn't the second-best guard on the team, but he's the best fit next to Curry. He can take on tougher defensive assignments that are necessary in the more physical style of international basketball. He embraced that role during the Tokyo Olympics, closing out games for Team USA to help win gold.\n\nHoliday's offense is perfect for this team as well. The starting lineup doesn't need shot creators. Rather, it needs a few role players who can cut well and shoot from 3.\n\nHoliday is one of the best corner 3-point shooters in the NBA, hitting an astounding 60 percent of his looks last season, per Cleaning the Glass. And his off-ball movement was the key in helping the Celtics win a championship.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 12 players on USA Olympics basketball roster\n\nDurant has been one of the best players for Team USA in its history. He's won three gold medals and is first all-time with 435 points. We already know that his game translates well to the Olympics. He's been one of the most clutch players in the world in those settings, helping to close out tight games several times.\n\nJames has a ton of experience himself, winning two golds and one bronze. He's first all-time with 88 assists and is coming off an NBA season in which he made Third Team All-NBA.\n\nHaving LeBron and KD as the forwards provides a very important advantage for Team USA. Scoring has not been a problem. They have lost previous international tournaments because of a lack of size and rebounding.\n\nOffensive rebounds are a much bigger part of international play. LeBron and KD are big and strong enough to keep other forwards off the glass, and they even offer great weak-side rim protection.\n\nMORE: Tyrese Haliburton ready to meet gold standard set by USA Basketball at Olympics\n\nEmbiid is the easy option to start for Team USA. He's the most talented center of the group, the best shooter, has the most size and is also an elite shot blocker.\n\nThat size will be even more valuable in the Olympics, which plays without a defensive three-second rule. Embiid can stay parked right under the rim on defense, where he is incredibly valuable at deterring layups.\n\nAmerica lost in the World Cup last year in large part due to the ineffectiveness of its centers. Jaren Jackson Jr. couldn't grab a rebound to save his life. That won't be a problem for Embiid, who averaged 11.0 rebounds per game in 2023-24.\n\nEmbiid gives this starting lineup five good-to-great shooters, allowing Kerr to play a five-out offensive style and lean into how unstoppable all of his players can be with good spacing. That gives Team USA not only its best lineup but one of the best that it's ever had for any Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors":

They finished in fourth during their 2023 FIBA World Cup run in Manila, which, suffice to say, is a huge disappointment, as it's always gold medal or bust for the most stacked basketball nation in the world. With redemption in the 2024 Paris Olympics as their main goal, the national team committee brought in the heavy hitters, such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant.\n\nKerr and Curry, in particular, go way back; the two have been at the heart of the Golden State Warriors' dynasty that was built at the start of the 2014-15 season. They are 10 years into their partnership -- which is both a frightening reminder of how fast time flies and a helpful nuggets for Team USA's bid to reclaim international basketball supremacy.\n\nIn particular, Steve Kerr plans to utilize all his years of experience in coaching Stephen Curry to bring out the best in him, featuring him heavily in Team USA's playbook with a slew of plays straight from the Warriors' bag.\n\n\"Having Steph on the team is fantastic for a number of reasons. He's obviously a brilliant player, but the comfort level that we have together. We'll run some of the actions we run in Golden State for him. He's very familiar with everything we're doing,\" Kerr told reporters, per NBC Sports Warriors via ClutchPoints Twitter (X).\n\nSteve Kerr clarified that Stephen Curry's impact stretches beyond the tactics they have drawn up on the board. Curry has a level of trust in Kerr thanks to their decade-long partnership with the Warriors that would then help get the rest of Team USA on the same page.\n\n\"But it's not just Xs and Os. He's one of our leaders. For me to have the ear of one of our leaders, and vice versa, I think it helps the communication process with the rest of the team,\" Kerr added.\n\nIt will certainly be a delight for Kerr to have the services of the greatest off-ball player of all time, someone whom opposing defenses cannot leave at any time. Stephen Curry's game-breaking gravity and unselfishness makes him the perfect fit for Team USA, and Kerr will be doing a disservice for everyone if he doesn't maximize Curry's skillset by deploying some Warriors-exclusive strategies.\n\nCould this be the best iteration of Team USA ever?\n\nCalling any other version of Team USA aside from the 1992 Dream Team as the best ever may seem blasphemous, and for good reason. That 1992 squad destroyed every team that came in their way of achieving the gold medal in Barcelona. But since then, there have been great basketball advancements all over the globe, closing the gap between the United States and the world in terms of talent and skill level.\n\nThe 2024 version of Team USA might be the most stacked it has been since 1992; this team will be having the services of four former MVPs in Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Joel Embiid. Curry, James, and Durant may be on the wrong side of 30, with James even turning 40 later this year, but in terms of basketball pedigree at the time of Olympic representation, this 2024 team may be unmatched.\n\nThe 1992 Dream Team only had three MVPs at the time of the Olympic Games (Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson). However, Bird was retired from the NBA by this time, and Johnson only came out of retirement following after he had contracted HIV. Simply put, Bird and Johnson were not exactly the players they once were in 1992.\n\nOf course, it's hard to view Curry, James, and Durant as being in their primes. But they are still playing at an incredibly high level, no ifs or buts.\n\nCurry averaged 26/5/5 for the Warriors last season, James was voted as the best player in Team USA training camp following a season in which he averaged 25/7/8, and Durant was still one of the best scorers in the association last year as he put up 27/7/5 on a nightly basis. Joel Embiid scored 34.7 points a night last season, and him being in the middle for Team USA gives them one of the most formidable scorers in world basketball.\n\nThis is without even mentioning four NBA champions that the 2024 team has in Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Davis, and Jrue Holiday. (The 1992 team had no other champions aside from Jordan, Bird, Johnson, and Scottie Pippen.) The 2024 Team USA squad also doesn't have a token member like the 1992 team did in Christian Laettner.\n\nOnly time will tell, of course, if the 2024 version of Team USA steamrolls opponents the way the 1992 squad did. 32 years ago in Barcelona, Team USA won by an average of 43.8 points, and they didn't even see the need to call a timeout once. But they certainly have the talent and the fit to replicate or even surpass that level of dominance.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

Competing in the Olympics meant sacrificing his summer, but James has been all-in on the preparation since he got the go-ahead, per ESPN's Tim Bontemps.\n\nThis will be the fourth Olympics James competes in, and his first since the London 2012 Olympic Games. He made his Olympic debut in the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, when Team USA fell short of the gold medal and won the bronze medal. Argentine won the gold medal that year. That was the last time Team USA did not win the gold at the Olympic Games. LeBron helped Team USA win gold at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and at London 2012.\n\nJames is joined by Lakers teammate Anthony Davis in competing for Team USA basketball at this year's Olympic Games. They are also joined by fellow NBA stars Stephen Curry, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, Anthony Edwards, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Haliburton, Kawhi Leonard, and Jrue Holiday. They will be the favorites to bring home the gold medal, which would be Team USA's fifth straight if so.\n\nThis could very well be the last time James plays in the Olympics, as he remains uncertain of when he will retire.

But before the tournament begins in earnest, they have a few tune-up exhibition games on the schedule, including a showdown between the two highly-touted North American sides in Las Vegas on Wednesday, July 10.\n\nI take you through my Canada vs. USA predictions and free betting picks as I explain why the Canadians could make this more competitive than oddsmakers believe.\n\nThe road to the Paris Olympics begins in Las Vegas tonight. Or at least it does for two of the teams with the greatest aspirations in the tournament in Team USA and Team Canada. While the Americans are big favorites to win the gold -- and their exhibition match against their northern neighbors on Wednesday -- both are far from a sure thing.\n\nThe world continues to catch up to Team USA when it comes to talent, and in recent years the Americans have proven much more vulnerable than their talent pool would suggest. After a close-run thing to capture gold in the Tokyo Olympics, Team USA failed to medal at the FIBA World Cup last year.\n\nIn part, that's because they sent their B-team in terms of star power. While a few key players from that fourth-placed finishing squad return -- including Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton -- the rest of the team is stocked with the most talented and decorated players in recent American basketball history.\n\nThey have arguably the best to ever do it in LeBron James, the most decorated men's Olympian in Kevin Durant, and first-time appearances by both Steph Curry and Joel Embiid just to name a few. While Durant is sidelined with a calf injury ahead of Wednesday's tilt, the rest of the team is a full go and should prove formidable.\n\nBut the other reason that American team didn't medal at FIBA is because Team Canada beat them in the Bronze Medal game. Canada has their own star power in the form of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray, who form as good a one-two punch in the backcourt as any team in the tournament -- including Team USA -- can muster.\n\nTeam Canada also has a level of continuity that the Americans do not. While this American team is almost entirely different than the one that suited up for the FIBA World Cup, Canada is bringing back almost the same roster with the addition of Murray. Some members of Team USA have played with each other at the international level, and some are teammates, but this mix is one they'll still be working to figure out.\n\nThere is still a ton of uncertainty with Team USA's rotation, and they'll likely use these exhibition games to experiment.\n\nWho stars and who sacrifices is always a tricky dance that Team USA typically takes a few games to sort out. Brandon Ingram was in theory going to be among Team USA's leading players heading into last year's World Cup, but in the end figured very little as Jalen Brunson, Edwards, and Haliburton seized the reins.\n\nThe Canadians come in knowing their roles on both ends, and that should give them something of a leg up when it comes to competing with Team USA's overwhelming talent advantage.\n\nAnd while Team USA theoretically has the ability to play multiple styles with the depth of their roster, they're limited in style of play with their starters. With Embiid presumably getting the nod as the starting center, they will have to play a drop defense with perimeter players fighting over the screen.\n\nJrue Holiday is excellent at navigating those kinds of screens, but the rest of the American guards are certainly not. Canada can have whichever guard isn't guarded by Holiday play pick and roll, and attack Embiid in space.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander and Murray are among the few players who can beat teams strictly from the midrange area, so a drop defense is not going to slow them down as long as they have quality spacing.\n\nTeam USA are deserving favorites, but with some kinks to work out and some notable defensive limitations, I suspect the Canadians will at least keep things respectable on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Ingram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/06e57847-fb95-47c8-a8d0-f8e20f2db9d2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 488, "textEnd": 495}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

They are sending the \"Avengers\" to France, so to speak, and among the stars on USA's loaded roster is no other than Golden State Warriors superstar point guard Stephen Curry.\n\nOn Sunday night, USA Basketball posted an image of Curry in Team USA uniform, and it has people on the internet buzzing.\n\nA lot of commenters loved how Curry looked in Team USA threads while others expressed disbelief that this will just be the future Basketball Hall of Famer's trip to the Olympics.\n\n\"my \ud83d\udc51 looking great,\" said X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) user @TrukTrZ.\n\n\"About time,\" commented @EclecticPoster.\n\n\"Goat is getting his first Gold \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe,\" chimed in @Dubswrld30.\n\n\"Nah I can't believe this is curry's first one damn top players really dropped playing SMH,\" a surprised SOULbeautifulme said.\n\nVia @SmartPicks_ai: \"Looks cool Steph in your first olympics.\"\n\n\"So weird seeing him wear any number but 30,\" stated @JenD_04.\n\n\"The Chef looks clean. Can't wait to watch this team COOK!,\" opined @SteveKBark.\n\nOf course, there will be others who expressed their dislike of Curry's new fit.\n\nEven at 36 years old, there is no denying that the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player can still get the job done. Just last season, he averaged 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game. He shot a middling 45 percent from the floor but was still incredible as usual from behind the arc, knocking down nearly 41 percent of his attempts from range. The Warriors won 46 games and missed the boat to the 2024 NBA Playoffs, but it certainly was not because of a lack of effort from Curry. With Team USA, Curry will not have to worry about support. Surrounded by bona fide NBA stars, Curry should be able to thrive and get plenty of premium looks not just for himself but for his teammates.\n\nJoining Curry on the backcourt of Team USA are the likes of Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns, Anthony Edwards of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jrue Holiday of the Boston Celtics, and Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers. The rest of the team is composed of LeBron James and Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers, Kevin Durant of the Phoenix Suns, Kawhi Leonard of the LA Clippers, Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics, Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, and Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat.\n\nNo shortage of threats to Curry, Team USA's Olympic Gold bid\n\nAlthough USA is still the No. 1 ranked team in the world, it's not enough reason for Curry and the rest of the squad to feel complacent. They just can't rest on their laurels, with the rest of the world having a target on their backs. Among the biggest threats to Team USA in Paris are Canada, Serbia, France, and Germany, which beat the Americans in the semifinal round of the 2023 World Cup in Manila. The United States didn't even score a medal in that tournament, as they lost to Canada in the bronze medal contest. That humiliating finish is what the Americans are looking to avenge, albeit in a different tournament.\n\nTeam USA will kick off their Paris campaign with a showdown right away against a gold medal contender in the form of Nikola Jokic and Serbia.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name":

That starting lineup would boast 12 NBA rings and eight MVP trophies. But it also would stack up as 173 years old, an average age of 34.6 years. Pretty long in the tooth compared to some global rivals. Keep in mind the fabled 1992 Dream Team had only two guys aged 31 or older to this squad's seven. James, Curry and Durant already are older than Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were on their way out the door in '92. And the Dream Team's top five in minutes logged in those Barcelona Games averaged 28.6 years old. How will Team USA spell gold in Paris? \"Gee, old.\"\n\nBrian Martin\n\nHere are the five players I'd choose to start, but I'm just as interested in seeing Steve Kerr's closing lineup when Team USA gets challenged.\n\nAssuming good health (especially with KD missing some of training camp due to calf soreness), I would start the four NBA MVPs in Curry, LeBron, Durant and Embiid, with one spot up for grabs. After a lack of size hurt Team USA at the FIBA World Cup, Kerr could go with Anthony Davis next to Embiid and have three players at 6-foot-10 or taller on the frontline. Or he could go with a more traditional backcourt with Edwards, Devin Booker or Jrue Holiday next to Curry.\n\nWhile the US failed to medal at the World Cup, Kerr raved about Edwards all last summer. His two-way ability and elite athleticism will offer balance to a starting five featuring three players age 35 or older.\n\nThis is a little gimmicky, but also comes with some strategy.\n\nPutting Davis at the four obviously compromises the team's shooting, and I'd be a little nervous about James and Embiid as the primary defenders in a bunch of pick-and-rolls. But good luck scoring in the paint or grabbing any rebounds against five guys who are no shorter than 6-foot-8. Really, who starts doesn't matter. It's not that the United States is unbeatable, but rather that anybody on this roster could deserve to start (or close) games. It's about finding the right mix and the hot hands by the time they get to the quarterfinals on Aug. 6.\n\nMichael C. Wright\n\nDepth affords Team USA flexibility for creativity with various combinations based on situational needs, meaning the starting five likely won't be the group that winds up finishing games.\n\nThis group provides plenty of scoring as all five players in this lineup are virtually unguardable. Curry and James (a two-time gold medal winner) can handle facilitation duties in addition to scoring, and there's no way you keep an Olympics legend like Durant out of the starting five, if healthy, of course. A three-time Olympics gold medalist, Durant has led the competition in scoring average in 2012, 2016 and 2020 and ranks No. 1 in Team USA history for points (435), 3-pointers (74) and free throws (69).", "source": {"uri": "nba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2307, "textEnd": 2313}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

James is a four-time MVP, Curry a two-time MVP and Durant and Embiid have each won the award once.\n\nSince men's basketball became an Olympic sport in 1936, Team USA has won the gold medal 16 times, although the U.S. boycotted the Olympics in 1980 with a team that would have featured future NBA players like Isiah Thomas, Mark Aguirre, Buck Williams, Ronaldo Blackman and Sam Bowie.\n\nTeam USA's 1972 loss to the Soviet Union in the gold medal game is one of the most controversial finishes in sports history. The 1988 team won a bronze medal and led to the U.S. allowing pro basketball players to participate in the Olympics -- which the rest of the world was already doing -- beginning with the Dream Team in 1992.\n\nThe 2004 team, which was James' first foray into Olympic competition, also won the bronze medal and led to a revamping of the process of selecting the Olympic team and the Redeem Team in 2008 featuring Kobe Bryant, James, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony and was coached by former Duke head coach Mike Krzyewski.\n\nThe 2008 team defeated Spain and Hall of Fame center Pau Gasol, 118-107, for the gold medal.\n\nAlmost as a direct result of Team USA sending its NBA stars to the 1992 Olympics and every Olympics after that, basketball exploded on the international stage and we are seeing the results of that with a loaded field in the 2024 Olympics.\n\nEven with all that talent, the country that will almost certainly pose the biggest threat to Team USA in 2024 will almost certainly be Canada. The Canadians have a team unlike any in the country's history and features Nuggets guard and NBA champion Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard and two-time All-NBA selection Shai Gilgeous-Alexander along with more NBA talent like Andrew Wiggins, Luguentz Dort, Dillon Brooks, R.J.

And from there it was like, 'Let's get it.'\"\n\nFor all that Curry, James and fellow future Hall of Famer Kevin Durant have achieved in their careers, they have yet to play together for Team USA. Curry played with Durant during gold medal runs in the 2010 and 2014 World Championships. James and Durant, meanwhile, won gold at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut this summer, the trio of superstars, now deep into their 30s, will take the floor together in international play for the first time. But don't call it a \"last hurrah.\"\n\n\"Nah,\" Durant told ESPN with a smile, when asked if that was how he viewed finally pairing up with both James and Curry on this team. \"These guys are still playing at an elite level. I feel like Bron could play 4 or 5 more and be here in 2028 in [the Los Angeles Olympics]. Steph's still playing great ball. I'm doing all right, too.\n\n\"I don't want this to be a farewell tour or make it just about us three. It's about trying to win this fifth in a row.\"\n\nHeading into Wednesday's Olympics tuneup against Canada in Las Vegas (10:30 p.m. ET), Team USA is a heavy favorite to win that fifth straight gold medal -- in part because of the presence of the NBA's three biggest American stars. Durant can become the first man to claim four Olympic basketball gold medals, having been part of the past three winning Olympic teams. James, his 40th birthday on the horizon, can add a third gold medal to an already impressive international r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAnd then there's Curry, who, after 15 seasons in the NBA, is preparing for his Olympic debut.\n\n\"Yeah, it's really cool,\" Curry said. \"I've played with Team USA before on the world championship stage, but I don't know what to expect when it comes to this challenge and this experience. And so I had the first-practice jitters. I'm sure I'll have it for the game [Wednesday] just because I know it means so much. ...\n\n\"Add the surrealness of who is on this team and all the battles that we've had over the course of our careers and the fact that we get to put that energy together as teammates. So I'm enjoying every minute of this.\"\n\nA sense of awe has permeated throughout the first few days of Team USA training camp. Past Olympic rosters have boasted plenty of talent, but there's a reason this group has been compared -- at times favorably -- to the fabled 1992 Dream Team.\n\n\"Do you see this team?\" center Bam Adebayo, playing in his second Olympics after winning gold at the 2020 Tokyo Games, said Sunday. \"When you put [together] a team like this, and you get compared to, like, the Dream Team, it kind of puts it in perspective how great this team can be if we play the right way.\"\n\n\"We got LeBron, KD and Steph,\" Team USA first-timer Anthony Edwards said. \"So I don't feel like nobody can beat those three by themselves on the court.\n\n\"So I mean, you mix in two of us regular guys, we'll be all right.\"\n\nIt has been striking to see Curry and James finally sharing the court for Team USA after their historic playoff battles: four straight NBA Finals showdowns from 2015 to 2018 and again in the 2023 Western Conference semifinals, where James' Los Angeles Lakers knocked out Curry and the defending champion Golden State Warriors.\n\n\"It was like a healthy resentment of somebody that's standing in your way,\" Curry said of his playoff battles against James. \"But through it all, there's obviously the utmost respect for who he is as a person and player and like how good he is and the challenge of trying to beat him and trying to solve that problem every year.\"\n\nAdded James: \"I know how much he loves to win and how much he loves to be in competition. We've always had like these short moments like either All-Star Games or whatever the case may be, where we had these short pockets of time together and it's been super organic and easy.\"\n\nCurry, James and Durant have spent much of the past two decades fighting against one another for NBA supremacy. For the next six weeks, they'll play side by side and try to enjoy the process of the trio's first -- and possibly only -- Olympic run together on the international stage.\n\n\"I can't speak for those two guys, but for me it's going to be ecstatic excitement, a humbling wow factor,\" James told ESPN. \"The last 15, 17, 18 years, myself, Steph, KD, have been the talk of the NBA. ...\n\n\"We don't know how many more opportunities we're going to have to even play the game. So to be able to have this moment at this point in our careers is just super special.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_bontemps@espn.co.uk", "name": "Tim Bontemps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice Hockey World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0709%2Fr1356619_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Some are even saying it could be the most talented ever.\n\nRegardless of where this iteration of Team USA stands in the all-time conversation, the first matter of hand is the pursuit of a fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. As the journey begins, Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards, who is an Olympic first-timer, made headlines by proclaiming he'll be the team's No. 1 option.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Team USA is talented enough to have a different No. 1 option depending on the pulse of that particular game, but there is likely a particular order in which head coach Steve Kerr and staff would prefer things to go.\n\nWho is the best player on this talented squad? Based on this past NBA season, the FIBA game and circumstance, The Sporting News attempts the near-impossible task of placing 12 of America's best in order.\n\nMORE: A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart headline star-studded USA women's basketball roster\n\nCurry's Olympic debut is sure to be a memorable one. With Golden State's Play-In Tournament elimination, Curry has had the benefit of an extended offseason to prepare for Paris.\n\nThe greatest shooter in the world playing with a shorter 3-point line will be scary for any team that faces Team USA. After shooting 40.8 percent on 11.8 3-point attempts per game in 2023-24, Curry should have a field day.\n\n2. Joel Embiid\n\nEmbiid will also benefit from having a long layoff after Philadelphia's early playoff exit. The FIBA game is beneficial for dominant big men and Embiid is just that. His value will be on full display throughout the Olympics as he'll be surrounded by players who complement his strengths.\n\nIt's easy to forget Embiid averaged 34.7 points in only 33.6 minutes per game in 2023-24.\n\n3. LeBron James\n\nIf this is the last Olympic hoorah for James, you can guarantee he'll make the most of it.\n\nJames, a two-time gold medalist and soon-to-be four-time Olympian, is somehow at the top of his game at 39. He'll be the floor general for a talented team that will benefit from his cerebral approach and playmaking abilities.\n\n4. Jayson Tatum\n\nOn the heels of an NBA title in June, Tatum looks to join the elite group of players to win a championship and Olympic gold in the same summer. After being the focal point of opposing defenses throughout the playoffs, the Celtics star can breathe easily, meaning the scoring should also come easily.\n\nMORE: How the Celtics' championship exemplifies sacrifice and Boston pride\n\n5. Anthony Davis\n\nIt's been 12 years since Davis took the floor on the Olympic stage but he now has an opportunity to apply the wisdom passed to him when he was a 19-year-old incoming rookie. Davis is a defensive mastermind and one of the game's most skilled players.\n\nDavis' rim protection and defensive prowess will be one of the keys to America having a chance to dominate.\n\n6. Kevin Durant\n\nDurant entered Olympic training camp hobbled by a calf injury, or else he'd jump higher on the list.\n\nOne of the purest scorers the game has ever seen, Durant has an opportunity to make it four consecutive gold medals. Even at 35, he still makes it look easy. The Olympics should be no different.\n\n7. Anthony Edwards\n\nTo say Edwards is on the precipice of a superstar leap, his landing at seventh is not meant as disrespect. The FIBA game suits Edwards well, as evidenced by his dominant play during last year's World Cup.\n\nEdwards' scoring is loud, but the other underrated elements of his game is what will pain opponents.\n\n8. Devin Booker\n\nIn 2021, Booker helped lead Team USA to gold as a starter on a team that rang off five straight wins after a stunning loss to open the tournament. He's three years older and an even better player now, and the experience from his first Olympic showing will benefit Booker in 2024.\n\n9. Kawhi Leonard\n\nThis is also the Olympic debut for Leonard, who will head to Paris despite injury woes ending his playoff run early.\n\nLeonard is still an elite two-way talent but a cautious approach could result in a more limited workload for the two-time NBA Finals MVP.\n\n10. Bam Adebayo\n\nIt's important not to understate the importance of the big man in FIBA play. Adebayo led Team USA in rebounding at the Tokyo Olympics and has an opportunity to show just why he's viewed by many as one of the league's more underrated players. Adebayo gets a chance to do a little bit of everything in Paris.\n\n11. Jrue Holiday\n\nHoliday lands at 11 but could very well be the most important player on this roster.\n\nUSA Basketball made it a point to add Holiday, who, as shown during the NBA Finals, is the perfect glue guy to ensure everything goes as it should. His perimeter defense will also stymie opponents.\n\nMORE: Tyrese Haliburton ready to meet gold standard set by USA Basketball at Olympics\n\n12. Tyrese Haliburton\n\nTo be last among the country's greatest players is not a slight but a commentary on how good this Team USA roster is.\n\nHaliburton, who is one of the world's best pure point guards, will be in paradise with the amount of players he can now set up.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And from there it was like, 'Let's get it.'\"\n\nFor all that Curry, James and fellow future Hall of Famer Kevin Durant have achieved in their careers, they have yet to play together for Team USA. Curry played with Durant during gold-medal runs in the 2010 and 2014 World Championships. James and Durant, meanwhile, won gold at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut this summer, the trio of superstars, now deep into their 30s, will take the floor together in international play for the first time. But don't call it a \"last hurrah.\"\n\n\"Nah,\" Durant told ESPN with a smile, when asked if that was how he viewed finally pairing up with both James and Curry on this team. \"These guys are still playing at an elite level. I feel like Bron could play 4 or 5 more and be here in 2028 in [the Los Angeles Olympics]. Steph's still playing great ball. I'm doing all right, too.\n\n\"I don't want this to be a farewell tour or make it just about us three. It's about trying to win this fifth in a row.\"\n\nHeading into Wednesday's Olympics tune-up against Canada in Las Vegas (10:30 p.m. ET), Team USA is a heavy favorite to win that fifth straight gold medal -- in part because of the presence of the NBA's three biggest American stars. Durant can become the first man to claim four Olympic basketball gold medals, having been part of the past three winning Olympic teams. James, his 40th birthday on the horizon, can add a third gold medal to an already impressive international r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAnd then there's Curry, who, after 15 seasons in the NBA, is preparing for his Olympic debut.\n\n\"Yeah, it's really cool,\" Curry said. \"I've played with Team USA before on the world championship stage, but I don't know what to expect when it comes to this challenge and this experience. And so I had the first-practice jitters. I'm sure I'll have it for the game [Wednesday] just because I know it means so much. ...\n\n\"Add the surrealness of who is on this team and all the battles that we've had over the course of our careers and the fact that we get to put that energy together as teammates. So I'm enjoying every minute of this.\"\n\nA sense of awe has permeated throughout the first few days of Team USA training camp. Past Olympic rosters have boasted plenty of talent, but there's a reason this group has been compared -- at times favorably -- to the fabled 1992 Dream Team.\n\n\"Do you see this team?\" center Bam Adebayo, playing in his second Olympics after winning gold at the 2020 Tokyo Games, said Sunday. \"When you put [together] a team like this, and you get compared to, like, the Dream Team, it kind of puts it in perspective how great this team can be if we play the right way.\"\n\n\"We got LeBron, KD and Steph,\" Team USA first-timer Anthony Edwards said. \"So I don't feel like nobody can beat those three by themselves on the court.\n\n\"So I mean, you mix in two of us regular guys, we'll be all right.\"\n\nIt has been striking to see Curry and James finally sharing the court for Team USA after their historic playoff battles: four straight NBA Finals showdowns from 2015 to 2018 and again in the 2023 Western Conference semifinals, where James' Los Angeles Lakers knocked out Curry and the defending champion Golden State Warriors.\n\n\"It was like a healthy resentment of somebody that's standing in your way,\" Curry said of his playoff battles against James. \"But through it all, there's obviously the utmost respect for who he is as a person and player and like how good he is and the challenge of trying to beat him and trying to solve that problem every year.\"\n\nAdded James: \"I know how much he loves to win and how much he loves to be in competition. We've always had like these short moments like either All-Star Games or whatever the case may be, where we had these short pockets of time together and it's been super organic and easy.\"\n\nCurry, James and Durant have spent much of the past two decades fighting against one another for NBA supremacy. For the next six weeks, they'll play side by side and try to enjoy the process of the trio's first -- and possibly only -- Olympic run together on the international stage.\n\n\"I can't speak for those two guys, but for me it's going to be ecstatic excitement, a humbling wow factor,\" James told ESPN. \"The last 15, 17, 18 years, myself, Steph, KD, have been the talk of the NBA. ...\n\n\"We don't know how many more opportunities we're going to have to even play the game. So to be able to have this moment at this point in our careers is just super special.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice Hockey World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0709%2Fr1356619_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The Americans have won the gold in the men's basketball tournament in the Summer Olympics since 2008 and they are unsurprisingly the favorite to win their fifth gold in a row.\n\nAll that being said, winning the Olympics isn't the lock that it used to be for Team USA. The rest of the world has significantly diminished the gap between themselves and the Americans, who will be sending a loaded roster filled with future Hall of Famers to Europe to try and prove to the world once again that when it comes to the sport of basketball, there is not a nation out there better than the United States.\n\nTeam USA will be put to an acid test early in the Paris tournament, with Nikola Jokic and Serbia meeting them for both teams' first games in the 2024 Olympics. Asked about his looming matchup against NBA rival, the Philadelphia 76ers star big man said that it's never his focus.\n\n\"I don't care about Joki\u0107. I'm playing for my national team,\" Joel Embiid said (h/t Justin Russo).\n\n\"It's all about focusing on ourselves and trying to make sure everybody's on the same page. When we get there, we've got to know what we got to focus on. Right now it's just about finding ways to get better every single day,\" added Embiid, who holds French and American citizenship.\n\nJokic and Serbia are among the countries expected to be the biggest obstacles for Embiid and Team USA.\n\nIt can be recalled that during the group phase of the 2016 Rio Olympics, Jokic scored 25 points on 11/15 shooting from the floor with six rebounds and three assists in a close 96-93 loss to the United States. The two teams met again in the gold medal match where the Americans flexed their muscles and crushed Serbia to the tune of a 96-66 score. Jokic scored just six points on 3/5 shooting in that contest.\n\nIn that edition of the Olympics, Team USA had a frontcourt featuring DeMarcus Cousins and DeAndre Jordan. This time around, it's going to be Embiid, Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers, and Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat.\n\nJoel Embiid debuts for Team USA\n\nEmbiid will be getting his first taste of Olympic basketball and he'll be doing it with the No. 1 ranked team in the world. Since he also has a French passport, many initially believed that he'd choose to represent France in the Olympics. A frontcourt that parades Rudy Gobert, Victor Wembanyama, and Embiid would have posed a huge threat to the rest of the competition in Paris. However, Embiid elected to play for the United States.\n\nAfter an early first-round exit from the 2024 NBA Playoffs with the 76ers, Embiid could brighten up his summer with a gold in Paris.\n\nIn the 2023-24 NBA season, Embiid averaged 34.7 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 5.6 assists while shooting 52.9 percent from the field.\n\nTeam USA 2024 Paris Olympics schedule\n\nThe Americans will open their Paris campaign against Serbia on July 28. Then they will go up against South Sudan on July 31 before finishing up their group play schedule with a showdown versus Puerto Rico on August 3. The quarterfinals are scheduled on August 6, the semifinals on August 8, and the gold medal game on August 10.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

The newly minted American citizen recently expressed his excitement about representing Team USA at the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe French national team was an option for Embiid, who is a dual US and Cameroon citizen. However, ultimately, he chose to join Team USA. Even Embiid expects to hear a lot of boos from French fans but remains confident in his choice. He has already begun training with Team USA, which shows that he is ready and willing to do what it takes.\n\nThe power forward of the Philadelphia 76ers isn't worried about French fans booing him during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Rather, he's thrilled about the opportunity and ready to soak up the knowledge that comes with performing alongside world-class players. In a recent video, he said,\" It means so much. It's been a dream for a long time. It's an electric group of guys, especially with such great players and the type of talent that you have. It's fun to be a part of.\"\n\nHe said about the team's environment, \"I'm just enjoying it. I play against them, so I feel like I know a lot about them, but I'm just being around them and learning how to play with each other.\"\n\nPicking a team for the Olympics was tough for the 30-year-old NBA star. Due to his dual citizenship, Embiid had the option to play for France, but he ultimately felt a deep connection with the USA. Embiid has been living in America for a long time, and his son was also born there.\n\nLast October, the 30-year-old posted about his decision on social media. He noted, \"I'm really proud and excited about this decision. It was not easy. I am blessed to call Cameroon, France, and the USA home.\"\n\nHe further added, \"After talking to my family, I knew it had to be Team USA. I want to play with my brothers in the league.

So much so that there was an apparent \"bully\" problem against Team USA, especially when it came to players down in the paint and the front court, but now it has drastically changed with such players as Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid.\n\nIt would make sense how USA was bullied in their size as they were a small lineup with the starting center being Memphis Grizzlies big man Jaren Jackson Jr. who stands at six foot, 10 inches and is usually a power forward. The coaches on the Olympics team even brought up to the players about the players being \"bullied,\" but the seven foot Embiid believes it will be a different story this time around according to Joe Vardon of The Athletic.\n\n\"Probably everybody knows it's hard to bully me,\" Embiid said. \"And it's hard to bully those other guys.\"\n\nBesides Embiid, more size was added with Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis who is much tougher at playing the center position where he even said that when it comes to the FIBA World Cup team, \"they feel like we got bullied last year.\"\n\nBam Adebayo talks about how Team USA will set the tone\n\nAnother addition to the Paris Olympics team on Team USA is Miami Heat star Bam Adebayo who does stand around six foot, 10 inches, but is one of the best defenders in the league as he was a finalist last season for the Defensive Player of the League. He was also on NBA's All-Defense first team and won the gold medal with USA in 2021 as with all the intensity added to Team USA, he believes they \"will definitely set the tone early.\"\n\n\"I feel like we will definitely set the tone early, no matter who is in the game,\" Adebayo said. \"I feel like the tone will be set from the start to the finish.\"\n\nSomeone that Adebayo knows very well that is on the coaching staff for USA is Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra who talked about the areas of need that were addressed whether it be size or physicality. He would even say that on this current iteration, the squad this year has \"Hall of Fame rebounders\" on the roster in Embiid, Davis, and Adebayo.\n\n\"We feel like size, physicality, rebounding ability -- we feel like we've addressed that,\" Spoelstra said, who is an assistant under Team USA's head coach Steve Kerr. \"These are Hall of Fame rebounders that we have on this roster.\"\n\nTeam USA coach speaks on how basketball is played internationally\n\nAnother coach who was on Kerr's USA staff along with Spoelstra was Los Angeles Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue and also talked about how they weren't prepared for the size in the last go around. He would emphasize how internationally, the game is much different compared to the NBA via The Athletic.\n\n\"Over there (internationally) the game is different,\" Lue said. \"Here (in the NBA), you can't really touch guys, can't be physical. Over there (Team USA) found out that they can be physical, they can run guys over, use your hands. It was just a different game, and we weren't prepared for it. And (so) we talked about it (Friday night).\"\n\nAdebayo hypes up Team USA heading into Paris Olympics\n\nSize and physicality will especially be crucial when facing teams like France with Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert or even against Serbia who has superstar Nikola Jokic. Still, the current Team USA has an immense amount of hype, but the players realize that, especially Adebayo who said that people have compared them to the \"Dream Team\" who had such players as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and many more legends.\n\n\"Do you see this team?\" Adebayo said. \"I don't disrespect any other country at all, so. So don't let that be your headline. But, you know, you put a team together like this and you get compared to the Dream Team, it kind of puts it in perspective of how great this team can be. You put a team like this together, and we play the right way, it's going to be hard to beat us.\"\n\nUSA's first exhibition game will be against a formidable rival in Team Canada who beat them in the FIBA World Cup to get the bronze medal as they have Oklahoma City Thunder's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Houston Rockets' Dillon Brooks. The latter would send a warning to Team USA despite their bolstered lineup meaning that despite the game being an exhibition, it should be an intense one that starts at 10:30 p.m. (EST).", "source":

In fact, his confidence, which borders on cockiness, has been a defining characteristic of his basketball career. But now, the Canadian-born player has set his sights on an even bigger goal - winning gold at the Paris Olympics.\n\nCanada, the underdog in this scenario, must eventually overcome a Team USA squad that features some of the NBA's greatest players: LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant. However, despite the daunting task, Brooks and his team still believe they have what it takes to topple Team USA and come away with the gold in Paris.\n\nBeat Team USA before\n\nDillon, a renowned defensive pest in the NBA, has every reason to believe they can beat the American team. After all, it wasn't too long ago that they did just that in the 2023 FIBA World Cup in Manila, Philippines. This victory, even though Team USA didn't bring their big guns, was a significant achievement for Canada. Their 127-118 overtime victory secured them the bronze medal and denied the Americans a podium finish.\n\nMaking that victory sweeter for Brooks was that he unloaded a whopping 39 points on Team USA's defense in that game. These things, along with the presence of proven superstars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray on Canada's roster, fuel Dillon's belief that they can defeat this formidable American squad.\n\n\"The belief was always there; we just had to put it together. Now we've got a lot of players that are committed, willing to build this every single summer to get better and better and build chemistry and build camaraderie,\" the 2023 All-Defense team member told The Athletic.\n\nAlthough Canada's roster looks nothing like Team USA's All-Star-laden roster, it still features several NBA standouts, such as RJ Barrett, Lu Dort, Trey Lyles, Andrew Nembhard, and Kelly Olynyk. In the knockout format the Olympics use in the tournament's latter stages, Brooks believes Canada is capable of winning gold.\n\n\"Our time was last year. And now (it's) our time for this year. But instead of getting bronze, we want the gold,\" the 6-foot-6 wingman boldly asserted.\n\nRelated: Kobe Bryant's former bodyguard compared working for him and other NBA stars: \"Kobe was a sit outside-the-gate person\"\n\nFirst shot at Team USA\n\nBrooks and the rest of his Canadian team get their first shot at Team USA on Wednesday when they square off in an exhibition game. The former Oregon Duck sees this game as an opportunity to show the world what they can do, and what better way to do it than at the Americans' expense.\n\n\"I take it as another game, but me being who I am, I like to make a statement,\" Dillon uttered. \"So I'll be ready to play. Team Canada will be ready to play, and we're gonna go balls to the wall and watch the film after and see if we got better.\"\n\nWith the Olympics only a few weeks away, this game should benefit both teams, allowing them to work out any kinks and fine-tune their strategies and rotations. For Canada, this game would give them an opportunity to see where they stack up against the team that is the odds-on favorite to win the Olympic gold medal.\n\nIn addition to Bron, Steph, and KD, Team USA also has 2023 NBA MVP Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Edwards, and Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nBrooks said he's glad Team USA is bringing its best players, as it would give his team a fair grasp of where they stand against the world's best at this point.\n\n\"You know, I'm happy that they're playing because, you know, we get to test our talents against theirs. And you know, it should be a fun one,\" Brooks shared.\n\nGiven Dillon's history with the likes of LeBron and Steph, this exhibition game should be nothing short of exciting for fans and players alike.\n\nRelated: \"Coop was playing out of his mind\" - Coaches and players rave about Cooper Flagg's performances in Team USA camp", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news",

Headlined by superstars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan, the team also featured eight more Hall of Famers including Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Clyde Drexler, and John Stockton to give it 11 in total.\n\nBut could the 2024 squad be even better? Danny Parkins thinks so.\n\n\"This is the most talented Team USA roster we've ever had. It is top to bottom more talented than the Dream Team,\" Parkis said Monday on The Herd with Colin Cowherd.\n\nThe USA men's basketball roster for the Paris 2024 games consists of NBA superstars Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Anthony Davis, Anthony Edwards, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, Tyrese Haliburton, Kawhi Leonard, and Jayson Tatum.\n\nNot only do most of the key players of Team USA's gold medal run in the pandemic-delayed Tokyo 2020 games three years ago return, such as current Phoenix Suns teammates Durant and Booker and current Boston Celtics teammates Tatum and Holiday, but Lakers duo LeBron James and Anthony Davis make their returns to the national team after extended absences and Golden State Warriors sharpshooter Curry will represent Team USA at the Olympics for the first time in his career.\n\n\"The Dream Team was more impactful, the Dream Team will win by a [greater] margin of victory,\" Parkins said. \"In terms of twelve people on a team together, this team, I agree with [Warriors and USA head coach] Steve Kerr, it's got 12 [future] Hall of Famers.\"\n\nParkins thinks the biggest key for this edition of Team USA to dominate as expected will be in the paint, where Davis is joined by fellow superstar centers Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers and Adebayo of the Miami Heat.\n\n\"I don't see a team with Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embiid getting dominated on the glass, or being out scored in the paint, so the fact that Joel Embiid can play for team USA, I think, tips the scale and takes away the biggest weakness of rebounding in size and now makes it a definitive strength,\" Parkins said.\n\nEmbiid, who has dual citizenship in France and America, made the decision to represent the U.S. instead of the France team alongside reigning NBA rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama and four-time NBA defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert. The French went home with silver in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, reaching the gold medal game before losing to the U.S. -- on a team that did not feature the phenom Wembanyama. France, led by Wembanyama and Gobert in the frontcourt, will be the USA's biggest challenge in the Paris Games as the host nation.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Team USA met for its first set of practices this past weekend and the roster is stacked as it includes some of the league's biggest and brightest stars.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are well-represented as the Americans will be led by LeBron James as well as Anthony Davis. James and Davis were part of the Team USA roster that won gold in the 2012 Olympics in London and 12 years later will look to repeat the feat.\n\nJoining them are fellow stars like Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard and Jayson Tatum. Team USA also features young superstars in Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton, who got their first taste of international play in the 2023 FIBA World Cup. Rounding out the roster is Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker and Jrue Holiday, who are back looking to bring home gold after doing so in 2021.\n\nGolden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr will be leading Team USA on the sidelines, but he's got plenty of help as he's got Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra, L.A. Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue and Gonzaga head coach Mark Few as assistants.\n\nIt's a star-studded group that is considered the favorites to win it all, though the international stage is brimming with talent across all the countries. Canada, France, Serbia and Greece are considered the biggest threats to the U.S., but there are also countries like Germany, Australia and Spain that are lurking in the other brackets.\n\nWith 73 current NBA players representing their respective countries in this year's tournament, the games will likely be much closer than they have been in year's past. However, Team USA has brought home the gold the past four Olympics and it'll be exciting to see if they can make it five consecutive wins.\n\nTheir schedule kicks off with some exhibition games to get ready for the Olympics before heading to France at the end of the month.\n\nUSA vs. Australia, Monday, July 15, 2024, 9:00 a.m. PT, Abu Dhabi, UAE, FS1\n\nUSA vs. Serbia, Wednesday, July 17, 2024,

The four-time NBA champion and two-time MVP is looking to win one of the few pieces of hardware he doesn't already have in his massive trophy case.\n\n\"That's why I'm here,\" Curry said after the team's practice Sunday at UNLV. \"It will mean everything.\"\n\nStars aligned\n\nThe best shooter in NBA history waited for this opportunity for a long time.\n\nCurry, 36, didn't make the Olympic team in 2012. He was hurt in 2016 after winning gold with Team USA at the 2010 and 2014 FIBA World Cup. Curry wasn't part of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, either.\n\nThe reason for his absence at the most recent Games was never explicitly stated. But participants didn't get the full Olympic experience because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Warriors were also looking to bounce back from a disappointing season where they were eliminated in the play-in round. Curry was working on a massive contract extension that was finalized in August 2021 as well.\n\nHis decision to sit out paid off. The Warriors won the NBA title the following season.\n\nThings lined up differently this year. The Games are back to normal, plus Warriors coach Steve Kerr is at the helm of Team USA.\n\n\"I'm feeling as healthy as I've ever been,\" Curry said. \"We didn't make the playoffs, so I had two months to kind of get ready. It's probably realistically my last opportunity to really have a chance to play, so it all kind of aligned the right way. I hope it continues to align with a gold medal.\"\n\nGame changer\n\nCurry could play a big role in whether Team USA emerges victorious.\n\nHis shooting will be vital in opening up space for teammates in the international game. He'll have to adjust to the FIBA ball, but he doesn't foresee any issues with that.\n\n\"I've had plenty of time to get some reps in since the season with it,\" Curry said. \"It's been an adjustment, but like anything the more reps you get, the more comfortable you get. Thankfully we have another two-and-a-half weeks before the first Olympic game to shake out those cobwebs and get used to the spacing on the floor and the feel of the ball and all that. None of that will be an excuse. It's just playing basketball at the end of the day and taking advantage of this window of training camp is going to be huge.\"\n\nHis teammates know even Curry's presence on the court will be a factor once the competition begins. The NBA's 3-point line is about 20 inches farther from the rim than FIBA's, so his shooting could become even more of a weapon.\n\n\"Anytime he moves, two or three people go with him,\" Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards said. \"So you get a lot of open shots playing with him.\"\n\nExcitement level\n\nCurry's presence is a major reason why Team USA, which begins Olympic play against Serbia on July 28, is favored to win gold despite facing the strongest field ever.\n\nOne of the few things that could hold the group back is injuries.\n\nCurry labored through some of Sunday's practice with a bloody hand. Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant, who is attempting to become the first four-time gold medalist in Olympic basketball history, was mostly a spectator because of a sore calf. Durant is considered day to day, Kerr said.\n\nTeam USA will at least get a boost Monday. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is expected to arrive in Las Vegas after missing the first two days of camp for personal reasons.\n\nDon't expect a bloody hand to slow down Curry, either. Not after he's waited this long for his chance to win gold.\n\n\"The whole Olympic experience is something I've never had before so I'm very excited about soaking that all in,\" Curry said. \"But the competition and challenge to win is probably as hard as it's ever been. I think we're up for it and I'm excited to be a part of it. I've had experience at the world championship level, but that was 10 years ago. This is a different level, so I'm excited.\"", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNLV_Runnin'_Rebels_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/19367201_web1_BKO-TEAMUSA-070624-es_007.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 3059, "textEnd": 3066}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports / Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nUSA Basketball is in Las Vegas for their training camp ahead of the Paris Olympics. This Team USA roster is among the greatest ever, as it includes an impressive group of top-tier NBA players. Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry is on the Team USA roster for his first Olympics, and reportedly had a bit of an injury scare during day two of training camp.\n\nAccording to Dalton Johnson of NBC Sports Bay Area, Curry was seen having his right hand checked out after Team USA's scrimmage, and had been looking down at it while continuing to participate in practice:\n\nThis report caused quite the concern among Warriors fans, as it was hard to determine the extent of Curry's discomfort from the initial report. In a follow-up post from Johnson, it was revealed that Warriors and Team USA head coach Steve Kerr was asked about Curry's hand, and said it is not something to worry too much about:\n\nThis is an encouraging update from Kerr, not only for the Warriors and their fans, but for Team USA basketball. It was reported on Sunday by Shams Charania of The Athletic that Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant is dealing with a minor calf strain that has him sidelined to begin Team USA camp, so the team certainly does not want to have any more marquee players unable to go through full practices.\n\nDraymond Green Fires Back at NBA Legend's Outlandish Warriors Statement\n\nMajor Update on Golden State Warriors' Offseason Plans Revealed", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cary, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cary, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_1_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden 1 Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_warriors/01j27h5s73ah0zvbjv7p.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Rich in history, the program has also featured some of the best basketball players in the world. Let's rank the 10 greatest players in Team USA history.\n\n10. Vince Carter\n\n\"Half-man, half-amazing\" that's what they called Vince Carter in the NBA. However, he was also a menace internationally. The six-time NBA All-Star has won the gold medal at the 2003 FIBA Americas Championship and an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\nAt the Olympics, Carter was responsible for arguably the most devastating dunk in international basketball history by putting a seven-foot Frederic Weis of France on the poster.\n\n9. Magic Johnson\n\nThe Dream Team was filled with talented scorers. As a result, they needed a top-tier playmaker to facilitate the offense. Enter Magic Johnson.\n\nFresh from coming out of retirement, Johnson was a co-captain of the Dream Team that captured the gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games. It was a statement campaign made by Team USA to the rest of the world about the talent differential.\n\n8. Scottie Pippen\n\nScottie Pippen proved in the NBA that he was the perfect running mate for Michael Jordan. As a result, there's no question that Pippen complements stars quite well.\n\nTo add to this, Pippen also proved this in the international stage. His two-way play helped the Dream Team capture the gold at the 1992 FIBA Americas Championship before conquering the Olympic gold in Barcelona. Four years later, Pippen repeated as a gold medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.\n\n7. Stephen Curry\n\nAlthough Stephen Curry has yet to make an Olympic appearance, basketball fans won't have to wait any longer, with the four-time NBA champion debuting in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nBut despite not having any prior appearances in the Olympics, it's worth noting that Curry has two of Team USA's last gold medals at the FIBA World Cup. Furthermore, he has yet to lose at the senior level with Team USA.\n\n6. LeBron James\n\nThere's no doubt that LeBron James is the best basketball player in the world. James has done it all in the NBA, breaking the all-time scoring record, winning four NBA titles, four Finals MVPs, and four NBA MVPs. But while his NBA career has been decorated, it's safe to say that his international career has been just as stacked.\n\nHe has won gold medal at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, two Olympic gold medals at the Summer Games along with a bronze, and a bronze at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. With James leading this year's Team USA roster at the Paris Olympics, adding another gold medal will further cement his legacy.\n\n5. Charles Barkley\n\nWhile the 1992 Dream Team took care of business, there's no question that Charles Barkley shined the brightest on a roster full of stars. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points per outing while shooting 71 percent from the field overall en route to a gold medal. Barkley once again wore the national team colors at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where Team USA mounted a gold-medal streak.\n\n4. Kobe Bryant\n\nWhen the world started to close the gap once more, the Redeem Team wasn't complete until Kobe Bryant entered the fray. With Bryant's addition, it's safe to say that Team USA found their missing piece to complete the international puzzle.\n\nThe Black Mamba injected some intensity while inspiring his teammates with his crazy work ethic. Furthermore, Bryant also pulled through in clutch moments, which played an instrumental role in conquering back-to-back Olympic gold medals.\n\n3. Michael Jordan\n\nEven before Team USA started fielding NBA stars, Michael Jordan was able to suit up for the national team as an amateur. In fact, he can add one gold medal at the Pan American Games, one gold medal at the Tournament of the Americas, and a pair of Olympic gold medals to his six NBA championships. With two gold medals, he's tied for the second most in Team USA history.\n\n2. Carmelo Anthony\n\nAt the NBA level, Carmelo Anthony was already a dangerous perimeter scorer. Put him in the international arena, it seems like Melo was even more unleashed. At one point Melo was the leading scorer in Team USA history and has led the team in scoring on numerous occasions.\n\nThe 10-time NBA All-Star has also converted his individual success to one gold medal at the FIBA Americas Championship, a bronze in the FIBA World Stage, and three Olympic gold medals along with a bronze. With three Olympic gold medals, Melo is tied for the most in Team USA men's basketball history.\n\n1. Kevin Durant\n\nFrom being a part of the Redeem Team to carving out his own era in Team USA basketball history, Kevin Durant is deadly both in the NBA and in the international stage.\n\nHe is currently Team USA's all-time leading scorer. Furthermore, he's also tied for the most Olympic gold medals in Team USA men's basketball history. With KD joining the team in Paris, adding another one would put him in the solo lead.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, and Tyrese Haliburton admitted they couldn't do it, while LeBron James revealed he isn't all that great at it either.\n\nThe fact that Curry, one of the greatest players of his generation, can't spin a basketball on his finger, is not something I'd have ever expected. Even LeBron struggles with it, which is just crazy.\n\nWith how disappointed Kevin Durant was, when he found out Haliburton and Embiid couldn't do it, I can only imagine how he'd react to his two great rivals not being able to pull it off either. Durant's Phoenix Suns teammate Devin Booker, meanwhile, certainly had no trouble with spinning the ball.\n\nBooker even tried to keep at it after bouncing the ball off his knee but lost control. Jrue Holiday effortlessly pulled that off, though, and I would give him the title of most skilled in this regard. Anthony Davis appears to be great at it too, and perhaps these two can teach Curry and James how to go about it during this training camp.\n\nNot being able to spin a basketball on their finger certainly hasn't stopped the two icons from dominating on the court, though, which is what really matters. Curry just averaged 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 0.7 steals, and 0.4 blocks per game for the Golden State Warriors in the 2023-24 season.\n\nJames, meanwhile, put up 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.3 assists, 1.3 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game for the Los Angeles Lakers. The two veterans are just very skilled at almost everything apart from spinning a ball on their finger.\n\nCurry and James are also reportedly set to start for Team USA at the Olympics, with the latter playing point forward and the former being off the ball. I always believed they'd make an incredible duo and we'll finally get to see them as teammates for the first time in a competitive setup in France. I'd say get ready for some fireworks when they step out on the court together.\n\nCurry has some extra motivation heading into the Olympics too, as this is the first time that he is ever taking part in the event. This is his only chance at winning the gold and I expect him to leave his all out there on the court. As for LeBron, he is gunning for his third gold medal.\n\nTeam USA is in Group C in the Olympics, alongside Serbia, South Sudan, and Puerto Rico. While the Serbs could pose a challenge, I would be shocked if the U.S. didn't top this group. The first group stage game is against Serbia on 28 July and it'll be followed by a clash against South Sudan on 31 July.

Fans are salivating over the talent that has been curated and selected.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr has called this team the most decorated since the Dream Team. The roster includes LeBron James in his last Olympics, Steph Curry's second Team USA appearance, the debut of sensation Anthony Edwards on the Olympic circuit, and the most decorated player in Team USA history, Kevin Durant.\n\nAlthough the all-time points-scoring leader is sidelined for a week and a half with a minor calf strain, his impact will be felt the second he steps on the court. Some fans have remarked that there is no wrong starting five because the team is so perfectly constructed.\n\nSome fans say that experienced players like Curry, James, and Leonard should start, while younger players like Edwards, Tatum, and Embiid should wait their turn and pay homage. However, with a roster this decorated, any five-man lineup would be stellar. True to his confident style, Anthony Edwards told the media he felt he was the number one option. \"I'm still the number one option. You might look at it differently,\" Edwards said. \"I go out there and be myself, I shoot my shots, play defense. They got to fit in around me. That's how I feel.\"\n\n\"I'm still the number one option. You might look at it differently,\" Edwards told the media. \"I go out there and I be myself, I shoot my shots, play defense.

You have LeBron finding Steph Curry for 3-pointers, with the line being a foot closer these shots seem as if they are layups for Curry.\n\nJayson Tatum has finally arrived after an excused absence for personal reasons. The NBA champion is wearing the number 10 in commemoration of his idol, Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe next phenom from Duke, freshman Cooper Flagg, has impressed at Team USA training camp. He has had the opportunity to play with the younger guys who are running scrimmages with the team as they prepare for Paris. NBA scouts are excited about his potential, and he is projected to be the number one pick in the 2025 NBA draft.\n\nTeam USA will face Team Canada in an exhibition match in Vegas Wednesday. Team Canada, which also has a lot of talent, is vying to be the team that slays the Team USA giant.

That isn't necessarily a given, though, as fans saw Team USA struggle and ultimately fail to earn a medal last year at the 2023 FIBA World Cup. Everyone knows what's at stake for America, including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile Harris is certainly more heavily focused on helping run the country, she knows the Olympics are right around the corner, and it's safe to say she's expecting big things from the athletes that will be representing the country. Harris made a guest appearance at Team USA's training camp in Las Vegas, Nevada on Tuesday, and she relayed her simple message to the team as they prepare for the Games.\n\nKamala Harris hoping to see Team USA win gold at the 2024 Olympics\n\nAfter struggling at the 2023 FIBA World Cup, Team USA loaded up for the Olympics in an effort to prove that they are still the top basketball powerhouse in the world. Given the amount of starpower on America's squad, which is led by LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Jayson Tatum, it's safe to say that expectations are very high for this squad.\n\nHarris seems to feel that way as well. While the Olympics largely focus on the sports and games being played, there is a bit of a political tie-in as well, which is largely why it's on her radar. As is the case with every country, though, there's a sense of nationalism involved too, so it's not very surprising to see Harris pulling for her country's basketball team to go out and do what they are expected to do at the Games.\n\nOn paper, Team USA should absolutely blow the competition out of the water. Their roster is comprised almost solely of All-NBA players, and the only two guys on their roster who weren't All-Stars this past season in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White (who is set to replace Kawhi Leonard after he bowed out on Wednesday morning) just won a championship with the Boston Celtics. Beyond that, they both were part of the All-Defensive second team, so it's not like they are bad by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe game of basketball is played differently in the Olympics, though, so it takes awhile for these players to adapt to the different style of play. Still, the team's talent should prevail, especially when they have so many different options that they can turn to depending on the situation they find themselves facing. Harris wants to see this team win gold, and you can bet that basketball fans all around America feel the same way as she does.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kamala-Harris-sends-1-blunt-request-to-Team-USA-ahead-of-Paris-Games.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Certainly not basketball, he said. Not until his family immigrated to the U.S. and he began to grow into the 7-foot, 280-pound man he is today.\n\nNow, he's a dominant force for the Philadelphia 76ers, an NBA MVP and a member of the USA men's basketball team with all eyes on winning gold next month in the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nDream realized. Dream attained.\n\n\"To think back, my dad was an athlete,\" Embiid said in an interview Sunday after Team USA's practice at the Mendenhall Center on the University of Nevada-Las Vegas campus. \"It's amazing it turned out this way. I chose these guys not because they're so good, but because I felt welcome.\"\n\nAnd he did have choices beyond USA, where he became a naturalized citizen in 2022. He could have played for Cameroon or France, which once held that Central African country as a territory. But he decided that Team USA was the right fit, playing alongside the likes of LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. Playing for coach Steve Kerr, who has won nine NBA championship rings and one Olympic gold medal in his career as player and coach.\n\nFrance, Team USA's toughest opponent in the run for the gold in the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics, wasn't even a consideration when Embiid was weighing his options.\n\n\"My home country of Cameroon, which I dearly love, we didn't make it,\" Embiid said. \"I've been in the U.S. for half of my life. This country means a lot to me. I love my own country, but with my dream and all I've accomplished in this beautiful country, with my son being an American, my family being here. This just made a lot of sense.\"\n\nThere was a time this season when it appeared Embiid might not make it on the Olympic team. He injured his left knee back in February and underwent surgery for a torn meniscus. He didn't return until April 2, having missed 29 games.\n\nThe injury took its toll, Embiid said upon resuming play. \"It was depressing,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe Sixers' playoff run, which fell short in the first round against the New York Knicks, and the potential of playing in the Olympics were enough motivation to inspire Embiid to push his recovery and rehab. Even while he was still out, Philadelphia coach Nick Nurse said he expected Embiid to play in the Olympics, if healthy, and that he had the full support of the organization.\n\nEmbiid overcame the mental apathy and whipped himself back into playing shape.\n\nThe motivation was obvious. The Olympics typically occur every four years. The 30-year-old, often-injured Embiid has eight NBA seasons behind him. Who knows what shape he will be in for the 2028 games in Los Angeles? The opportunity might not come around again.\n\nNow, Embiid is taking advantage and playing for possibly the most talented men's basketball team in Olympic history. Embiid wasn't even born when the first U.S. Dream Team galloped through the 1992 Games.\n\nBut Embiid has his own goals. He'll likely be the starting center on the men's team that has won the last four gold medals and 16 overall. Playing for his own adopted country, he's intent on adding to those gaudy numbers.\n\n\"I'm just here for two things,\" he said. \"Win the gold and realize my dream, which I've always had, and be some part of the Olympic experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barry_m_bloom@sportico.com", "name": "Barry M.

Y'all might look at it differently, but I don't.\" Then he added that \"they've got to fit in to play around me.\"\n\n\"They\" includes LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant.\n\nA little brash, all kinds of cockiness and full-on self-promotion, but the 22-year-old Edwards is the sure top dog of the squad that will make a run at winning the gold medal in Paris.\n\nRelated: NBA MVP race 2024-25: Will the NBA have a new MVP winner?\n\nThe first of five exhibitions is Wednesday against Canada. Team USA is looking to win its fifth straight gold with this roster:\n\n1. Anthony Edwards -- He turned the Minnesota Timberwolves from a perennial doormat to a Western Conference finalist. That's some accomplishment. Edwards is an intense competitor, and the two-time All-Star who averaged 25.9 points last season is ready to seize the throne.\n\n2. Jayson Tatum -- Fresh off his first NBA title with the Boston Celtics, Tatum now resides on the top floor of NBA royalty. Tatum is a supreme team-first player, which is needed on a team full of superstars. He averaged 15.2 points for the 2021 gold-medal team in Tokyo.\n\n3. Joel Embiid -- He's playing for the U.S. for the first time after getting his citizenship in 2022. The lone concern with Embiid is the health of his left knee. It caused him to miss ample time in the regular season and hobble throughout the postseason. This won't be the 2022-23 MVP version but he's one of the best big men in the world.\n\n4. Stephen Curry -- Here's your chance to win a bar bet: Curry is an Olympics rookie. Yep, first-timer. He's looking to add his first gold medal to his hundreds of achievements. Probably also hoping to end his pregame shooting ritual by sinking a 3-pointer from the Eiffel Tower.\n\n5. LeBron James -- James is playing in the Olympics for the first time since 2012. He has two gold medals and one bronze during his Olympic ventures. James will be focused on keeping everyone involved and not trying to take over as the star.\n\n6. Devin Booker -- He is one of five holdovers from the 2021 gold medal squad. Booker is a great fit due to his unselfishness. He's willing to pass the ball and set up others. He averaged 9.3 points in six games in the 2021 Olympics.\n\n7. Kevin Durant -- His Olympic history says he should be ranked higher, but his current calf ailment can't be ignored. Those day-to-day calf injuries often turn into missing three to four weeks. Durant is looking to become the first four-time gold medalist in Olympics men's basketball history (currently tied with Carmelo Anthony). He also holds the U.S. record of 435 career points.\n\n8. Anthony Davis -- Back for the first time since the 2012 team won gold in London. Davis saw an average of 7.4 minutes of action back then and will certainly have a bigger role this time. Having Davis and Embiid on the same floor at the same time will be a headache for opponents.\n\n9. Bam Adebayo -- A valuable player content with focusing on defense and rebounding. He averaged 19.3 minutes in the Tokyo Games and figures to fall around that same range. Important to have a tough guy on the team.\n\n10. Jrue Holiday -- Team USA's third-leading scorer in Tokyo at 11.8 points per game. Another player who is team-first and excels on defense. A loaded roster when he's No. 10.\n\n11. Tyrese Haliburton -- A newcomer to Team USA after his spectacular season for the Indiana Pacers. He'll play a bench role in Paris. Part of his value is due to his ability to play both guard spots at a high level.\n\n9. Derrick White -- While would-be first-time Olympian Kawhi Leonard ranked ninth, we had to shuffle these once he bowed out. White isn't a star player by any means, but he's shown more than capable of being a team player who offers an all-out effort on both sides of the floor.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com",

A big name to look out for is the legendary guard out of the Golden State Warriors, Stephen Curry. While he has donned the Stars and Stripes for the FIBA World Cup, it will be his first time representing the country in the oldest sporting event in the world. So, how is he doing under the Steve Kerr-led squad, and has Trayce Jackson-Davis made an impact alongside him despite being in the Team USA Select team?\n\nIt is almost unbelievable that this will be Stephen Curry's first run at the Olympics. The Warriors legend did commit to playing in Tokyo back in 2020 but that fell through. So, the 2024 Paris Olympics will be the debut for him. Curry could not believe that this was happening and was just ecstatic about the whole situation, via Mark Medina of Sportskeeda.\n\n\"When you with this type of talent, the best in our league and the best in the world, we want to continue our dominance as Team USA. It's the whole Olympics experience, something that I've never had before. I'm very excited about just taking it and soaking it all in. But, the competition and challenge to win is probably going to be as hard as it's ever been. I think we're up for it. I'm excited to be part of it knowing I've had Team USA experience at the world championship level. That was 10 years ago and this is a different level. So, I'm excited,\" the Warriors guard declared.\n\nHow has Warriors star Stephen Curry been doing in Team USA scrimmages?\n\nIn one of the Team USA practices, Curry was looking down at his right hand a lot. Steve Kerr had already ruled out the possibility of it being a serious injury. The Warriors guard had an unfortunate clash with Brandin Podziemski on Day Two of their Olympics preparation. Curry does not think that this is all serious as well and even had some praise for Podz and Trayce Jackson-Davis.\n\n\"I had a little blood going on. Between him and Trace, these are the same experiences we've had earlier in my career. I was selected in my rookie year to be on the 2010 World Championship team. So, you get to kind of experience the game and get tested a little bit, work on some stuff, and make the most of the summers. It's kind of cool seeing them go through that same process. He bel0ngs on every court, that's what you need. Hopefully, I carry it over to the season,\" the Team USA 2024 Paris Olympics star said.\n\nThere is a lot to be thankful about for Warriors fans. One of them is that they will get to see their franchise star hopefully win a gold medal. Another is the fact that he did not get injured during practices for the Olympics.

With a star-studded cast highlighted by Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Anthony Edwards and more, the only thing on their mind is bringing a gold medal back to the United States.\n\nCheck out our Sneakers news for more upcoming releases and breaking content!\n\nAs is the case with any special occasion like the Olympics, the players will have the chance to showcase their signature footwear in new Red/White/Blue iterations to match the colors of their uniform and flag. We've already seen glimpses of what a few athletes will be wearing, but we now have first looks captured by @NBAKicks as to what players are lacing up for the first few rounds of team practices. Check out our breakdowns of each sneaker!\n\nLeBron James - Nike LeBron 21\n\nLeBron James will be making his fourth appearance for Team USA, which ties Kevin Durant's total for most all-time. He'll be making history as he enters his 22nd year in the NBA and will play alongside his son Bronny James. He was seen rocking a white colorway of his latest Nike LeBron 21 sneakers ahead of Team USA practice. Featuring red laces and a multi-colored Nike Swoosh on the inside, The King is going with a clean sneaker to begin his chase for gold. He's no stranger to Olympic-themed sneakers and he adds another to his collection with this LeBron 21.\n\nAnthony Edwards - Adidas AE 1\n\nArguably the most successful signature sneaker we've seen over the last year, Anthony Edwards will make his first Olympics appearance in the latest USA-themed Adidas AE 1. We caught a sneak-peek of these prior to his debut of them and we know they'll come in three separate colorways. The navy blue pair has already been slated for release, but Edwards came out hot with this white pair for the first practice. The Adidas AE 1 has been known for its innovative combination of colorways due to the futuristic design, and here we a navy blue sockliner with a contrasting red toe. Be on the lookout for Edwards' other pairs as he likes to switch his shoes often from game to game.\n\nKevin Durant - Nike KD 17\n\nKevin Durant will also be making his fourth appearance for Team USA as the most decorated member of this Olympic squad. Always taking the opportunity to represent his country, Durant is the all-time leader for Team USA in points (435), PPG (19.8), field goals (146), 3-pointers (74), and free throws (69). We saw him debut this colorway when he showcased the Team USA uniforms for the first time just a few days prior. The Nike KD 17 is the latest in his illustrious line with Nike and he continues to put out some of the best footwear for mobile big men like himself. The clean red-to-blue gradient along the rubber supports adds to the overall look of these.\n\nKawhi Leonard - New Balance Kawhi 4\n\nKawhi Leonard is back in action and makes his first appearance for Team USA in the red, white, and blue. He's one of the best talents in our game today and after an NBA Playoffs where he wasn't much of a factor, fans are excited to see him playing basketball again. He'll be wearing his newest New Balance Kawhi 4, which was unveiled just a few months ago as the newest continuation with his signature line. New Balance has grown into a solid voice in the basketball space with signings like Tyrese Maxey and Jamal Murray, but Kawhi Leonard was NB's first poster child when he signed back in 2018.\n\nHis newest Kawhi 4 features a sleek low-top cut with intermittent blue panelling along the sockliner and midsole. The laces are done with red and white speckles and we see Kawhi's logo along the tongue - a solid debut shoe for his first Team USA runs.\n\nJrue Holiday - Nike Sabrina 2\n\nJrue Holiday is coming into this offseason as a winner and NBA Champion with the Boston Celtics. He's also making his second appearance for Team USA, where he scored 71 points and was third in scoring behind Kevin Durant and Jayson Tatum back in 2020. He's one of the best defenders in the league and his presence will be valued throughout this tournament. He's also been the NBA's biggest supporter of the Nike Sabrina 1 sneakers, Sabrina Ionescu's debut shoe, and wore the model more than any other player in the league.\n\nWith her second Nike Sabrina 2 already out, Sabrina Ionescu's shoe will waste no time in making it to the international spotlight. Here we see Holiday lacing a clean white pair with red flywire details throughout.\n\nJoel Embiid - Sketchers SKX Float\n\nJoel Embiid ended up choosing the United States over countries like France and Cameroon where he owns citizenship, so it'll be interesting to see him alongside his USA teammates for the first time. In a massive move, Joel Embiid signed his first signature sneaker deal with Sketchers and has been rocking the SKX Float model for much of last season. Here, we see Embiid lacing a white and navy blue pair of the Floats. Given his MVP-caliber season last year, it's clear why he's favoring this as his sneaker of choice for the Olympics.\n\nStephen Curry - UA Curry 12\n\nAlthough he's had experience playing for Team USA in the FIBA World Cup, Warriors' Steph Curry will be making his Olympic debut after a number of final selections to the team in the past. The greatest shooter of all time will look to showcase his skills on another international stage as he takes the court wearing his latest Under Armour Curry 12 sneakers. Signed to UA since 2013, Curry has carved a path for himself and has the brand's most successful basketball line ever. Here, we see a navy blue edition of the Curry 12 with a clean white midsole, a nice diversion from the mostly-white sneakers we've seen debuted at training camp.\n\nDevin Booker - Nike Book 1\n\nDevin Booker will return to Team USA following his appearance in 2020 as he help the United States bring home a fifth-consecutive gold medal. His signature Nike Book 1 sneakers stood out at team practice in this vibrant red colorway. We see the shoes contrasted with white and they seem to feature a gum bottom, creating a balanced overall look to these. The Nike Book 1 has been extremely popular as a lifestyle sneaker as well, so it's cool to see an eye-catching colorway like this.\n\nTeam USA will play their first game in the Group Stage against Serbia on July 28, 2024 - tune in to the 2024 Paris Olympics to catch all these stars and more in-action on the biggest stage!", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Spears, USA Basketball's managing director Grant Hill said James' commitment to Team USA has been impressive to watch over the last few months:\n\n\"It's a credit to him. At this stage with all that he's done, he wants to do this. When Joel committed. LeBron texted me, 'Good job.' He's in. Not only is he in, he's emotionally invested. I didn't know LeBron that well. I'm a little old school. But I've gotten to know him and connect with him more so over this last year. I've just been impressed with his passion for the game, his passion for USA Basketball and his desires. You would think he's Year 3, never won, hungry. All that he's done, he is approaching this as if he's accomplished nothing. And that's in part what makes him so unique and certainly one of the best to ever do it.\"\n\nJames declined to play in the 2016 Rio Olympics for rest purposes and sat out the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 due to his film commitment to Space Jam: A New Legacy. The Paris Games will be his fourth Olympics, as he won a bronze medal in Athens in 2004.\n\nThe 39-year-old is a member of a star-studded Team USA roster that includes fellow former NBA MVPs Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Joel Embiid.

Jeff Chiu/Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS -- LeBron James called Stephen Curry last fall with a simple proposition: Let's go to France together.\n\nThe basketball megastars had known each other since James, then 23, made a point to watch Curry, who had just turned 20, play for Davidson in the 2008 NCAA tournament. From 2015 to 2018, their friendship turned into a healthy rivalry as James's Cleveland Cavaliers and Curry's Golden State Warriors became the first teams in NBA history to face off in four consecutive Finals. Though both had represented the United States at major international tournaments, they were never on the same team unless it was an NBA All-Star Game.\n\nWhat's more, James had won Olympic gold with Kevin Durant, and Curry had teamed with the 35-year-old Phoenix Suns star to win a pair of championships with the Warriors. The 2024 Paris Olympics, the trio realized, was an opportunity to join forces for the first time and put their many Finals battles behind them.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to being off the floor with Steph and being able to enjoy those moments,\" the 39-year-old James said Sunday as he participated in USA Basketball's four-day Olympic training camp. \"The game of basketball doesn't last forever. You don't want to have a relationship (expletive) up by 'LeBron versus Steph - they should never smile, and they should hate each other.' As much as me and KD have gone head-to-head and me and Steph have gone head-to-head, I'm able to not listen to the false narratives.\"\n\nJames, the Los Angeles Lakers star who hadn't played internationally since 2012, said he first checked with his wife, Savannah, who gave her blessing for the summer abroad. Curry was lured by the chance to win his first Olympic gold medal and to play for Steve Kerr, his coach with the Warriors. Durant didn't need any convincing: After he led the Americans' triumph at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, victory in Paris would make him the first men's basketball player to win four Olympic golds.\n\n\"He's almost 40 years old, and he's still playing at an elite level,\" Durant said of James. \"That's inspiring to me. ... I know it's important to a lot of people to be the only man to do (something historic). That stuff never really moved me. The journey is what's cool to me. Just knowing I have these memories to lean back on at any time is cooler than looking at the medals or championship trophies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith those three committed, soon enough USA Basketball had compiled one of the deepest and most accomplished rosters in its illustrious history. Even after replacing six-time all-star Kawhi Leonard, who had been working back from a knee injury, with Derrick White on Wednesday, the Americans have 11 players who have earned All-Star nods, four former NBA MVPs, three former Finals MVPs and seven players who have won NBA titles. And then there are Kerr and assistants Erik Spoelstra and Tyronn Lue, who have combined to coach seven NBA championship teams since 2012.\n\nThe Americans will bring an embarrassment of riches to Paris as they seek their fifth consecutive gold medal. After completing training camp Tuesday, Kerr's team will play five exhibitions before its Olympic opener against Serbia on July 28. The first tuneup is Wednesday against Canada at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nTo win gold Aug. 10, the Americans must advance out of a four-team group and then win three consecutive games in the knockout round. France, Canada and Serbia are among the medal contenders in the 12-team field, but the Americans are the overwhelming favorites.\n\n\"Do you see this team?\" Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo exclaimed. \"The rest of the world is trying to catch up, but if you put a team like this together and we play the right way, it's going to be hard to beat us.\"\n\nThe buzz around the team is at its highest point since Kobe Bryant, James and Durant won gold at the 2012 London Olympics. Hundreds of fans have lurked at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, screaming in delight when Curry and Durant have worked their way through USA Basketball's makeshift headquarters. Autograph hounds braved 117-degree heat on the final day of camp, and upper-bowl tickets for Wednesday's exhibition were being listed for more than $500 on resale sites. Vice President Harris even made a cameo at Tuesday's practice, shaking hands with James and posing for photographs with Curry.\n\n\"It's a really cool vibe,\" Curry said. \"I had first-practice jitters, and I'm sure I'll have it for the first game. There's a surrealness of who is on this team and all the battles we've had over the course of our careers. (James, Durant and I) get to put that energy together as teammates. This will probably be my only time having this experience.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacing ever-present gold-or-bust expectations, Grant Hill, USA Basketball's managing director, and Kerr sought substance to complement the superstar sizzle. At the Tokyo Olympics and the 2023 FIBA World Cup, the Americans fielded versatile but undersized teams that occasionally looked overmatched.\n\nThe Americans lost to France in their opener in Tokyo before winning a rematch in the gold medal game. At the World Cup, the heavily favored Americans suffered losses to Lithuania, Germany and Canada while finishing a disappointing fourth.\n\nWhen Kerr brought this team together, he screened video from the World Cup losses to help explain what had to change. A survey of this year's competition only reinforced the need to add frontcourt reinforcements. France will deploy Victor Wembanyama, the unanimous rookie of the year, and Rudy Gobert, the defensive player of the year, in an imposing combination. Serbia is expected to be led by three-time MVP center Nikola Jokic, and Greece boasts two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nTo prepare for those matchups, USA Basketball recruited Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, who also was eligible to play for France and Cameroon. Embiid, the 2023 MVP, will team with Anthony Davis and Adebayo to form an excellent interior rotation. Given that all of them are comfortable on the perimeter, Kerr will be able to deploy supersized lineups with two of the three playing together.\n\n\"It's hard to bully me,\" Embiid said. \"It's hard to bully (Davis and Adebayo). I'm just excited to get the ball in the post and have Steph, KD and LeBron cutting.\"\n\nThe Americans have excellent size across the board. Kerr can deploy the 6-foot-9 James as a point forward when he wants to ramp up the pressure, and Durant will be joined on the wings by Jayson Tatum, who has excellent length and physicality. Jrue Holiday and White serve as sturdy defensive-minded complements to Curry and pass-first point guard Tyrese Haliburton in the backcourt, while Anthony Edwards and Devin Booker round out the roster as scoring guards who can space the court.\n\nJames joked that USA Basketball has assembled \"the greatest AAU team of all time,\" but Kerr is bracing for \"an enormous challenge.\" He made it clear that he and Curry \"won't be playing 36 holes of golf on game days,\" as Coach Chuck Daly and Michael Jordan famously did as the Dream Team waltzed through the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\n\nIn a reminder that unforeseen challenges can surface, Durant suffered a minor calf injury that sidelined him for training camp and Leonard departed before the first exhibition. Still, the Americans will journey to Paris with high hopes and immense faith in their headliners.\n\n\"We've got LeBron, KD and Steph,\" Edwards said. \"I don't feel like nobody can beat those three by themselves on the court. You mix in two of us regular guys, and we'll be all right.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com",

LeBron James and Stephen Curry are going to be teammates for Team USA. The Golden State Warriors superstar is going to represent the Stars and Stripes for the first time in the Olympics. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers legend is a veteran when it comes to showing up for his country. These two might have varying levels of experience but they are bonded with one goal, to win a gold medal. Even Steve Kerr could not fathom how great these two have been.\n\nBefore the assembly of the 2024 Paris Olympics Team USA squad, LeBron James and Stephen Curry had only ever joined forces on All-Star Weekend teams. So, when the roster was announced, it was a welcome surprise to most of the avid spectators of the sport that these two would be on the same squad. They are a perfect complement to each other. The Lakers great is a generational ballhandler with insane passing skills. Meanwhile, the Warriors legend knows his way around off-ball movement and knocking down shots from outside.\n\nSteve Kerr shared this very same sentiment. The Team USA head honcho even expected the two to have greater chemistry once the 2024 Paris Olympics start, via Arash Markazi of The Sporting Tribune.\n\n\"Today was the first day out of the first three that we've played them together in the scrimmage. It's fun to see them together, their games complement each other perfectly. I think they are really enjoying it. Just watching them, I know they like playing together. They've been such incredible competitors over the years. It's nice for them to finally compete on the same side,\" Steve Kerr said.\n\nIf there is anyone who knows how much these two would do good together, it would be the Warriors and Team USA head honcho. Kerr has seen how LeBron James and Stephen Curry battled it out in the middle of the 2010s up to the present moment.\n\nHow is Team USA looking before the 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nThere are some early bumps in the road when it comes to this team's preparation. The injury bug hit them quite early. Stephen Curry had a bleeding hand after some contact during their scrimmages. Kevin Durant was also sidelined with a calf injury for a large chunk of the Team USA practices. Kawhi Leonard's injury management continues to be up in the air amid all of these too. So, Coach Kerr and the rest of the staff need to refine how they'll manage the rotation with guys like Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, and Tyrese Haliburton all still fatigued from their deep postseason runs.\n\nBut, the talent is still there regardless of how many issues this Paris Olympics squad faces. Overall, it will just be up to how they rotate the ball and execute the agreed-upon schemes that determine the success of this squad. Their squad will face Serbia, South Sudan, and Puerto Rico. All games have Team USA winning by a sizeable margin.

White, 30, will join the national team less than a month after winning an NBA title and signing a lucrative contract extension with Boston.\n\nThis is not the first time that White will represent America on the international stage, but this time, he has an opportunity to play an even greater role in Team USA's efforts.\n\nHere is what makes White an ideal candidate to join this roster.\n\nMORE: Why Kawhi Leonard is withdrawing from Team USA for the Olympics\n\nWhite is an ideal replacement as he is one of the most malleable players in the NBA.\n\nA 6-4 combo guard, White can guard multiple positions on the wing at a high level, resulting in All-Defensive Team selections in the past two seasons. Offensively, he averaged 16.7 points and 4.1 assists while shooting 40.4 percent from deep during the Celtics' title run in 2024.\n\nAs shown with Boston, White is the perfect type of connective player to play around the caliber of superstar talent present on the Team USA roster. He'll be a menace defensively and will benefit from the playmaking abilities of Team USA's stars on offense, most notably LeBron James and Jayson Tatum.\n\nOpposing defenses will have tough decisions to make on the perimeter as half of Team USA's 12-man roster shot at least 38.0 percent from 3-point range during the 2023-24 NBA season.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that Team USA would have better off replacing Leonard with a forward, but White's appeal is clear.\n\nMORE: Why Joel Embiid is playing for Team USA at the 2024 Olympics\n\nIn 2018, White played for Team USA's World Cup qualifying team, averaging 9.5 points and 5.0 assists over two games. In 2019, White was named to the 12-man roster for Team USA at the FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nWhite appeared in eight of the team's 10 games.\n\nAfter going a perfect 8-0 in group play, the 2019 squad lost the first two games of the knockout phase and finished seventh in the tournament.

While he's never made an All-Star game, he drew serious consideration last season.\n\nThe Celtics would not have won a title without White fulfilling the role of overqualified glue guy on their team.\n\nOn the surface, that would make him a terrific replacement for Kawhi Leonard, who pulled out of Team USA on Wednesday afternoon. But delve deeper, one thing becomes clear: White was the wrong choice.\n\nMORE: Why Kawhi Leonard is withdrawing from Team USA for the Olympics\n\nWhite has made a living fitting into any situation, but this is unlike his previous stops for a couple of different reasons.\n\nWhite's defense is not going to be as useful in this type of international setting. While he's one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA and has made two consecutive All-Defensive teams, the international game is much different from the NBA. Team USA has underachieved in previous international tournaments because they have not adjusted for the increased importance of size.\n\nOffensive rebounding is a much larger part of FIBA rules for a couple of different reasons, including no offensive goaltending and a smaller court where play is more congested. Team USA finished fourth in last summer's World Cup because of that inability to match up with bigger teams.\n\nWhite is a good rebounder, but he does get targeted on defense by bigger players. At just 6-4 and 190 pounds, he doesn't have the strength to guard up in position.\n\nCompounding this problem for Team USA is that Stephen Curry is likely going to start and play a lot of minutes. Curry is also undersized and has issues defending bigger guards.\n\nIf Team USA was going to bring another guard on the roster, they should have gone with one that is more switchable. Alex Caruso is a similar player to White, for example, but Caruso regularly guards power forwards in the NBA.\n\nMORE: Here's the answer to Team USA's toughest question\n\nWhite is redundant on this team, through no fault of his own, because the USA will now have half of the roster filled with guards. He will be the sixth one added to a squad that can take only 12 players to France.\n\nThe only forwards on the team are LeBron James, Kevin Durant (who is battling a minor injury) and Jayson Tatum. There are three centers as well -- Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo and Anthony Davis.\n\nInternational play features only five fouls before players foul out of a game, instead of the six in the NBA. Team USA will not only be short on big men but there will be less margin for error if any of them gets into foul trouble.\n\nThat is going to be even more important because many of Team USA's opponents have some very big frontcourts, Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama on France chief among them.\n\nLeonard should have been replaced by another forward instead of leaning into an even smaller team. Future No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg would have been an interesting addition. Aaron Gordon could fill White's glue guy role, but add much more rebounding and size. Paul George would have given Team USA size, shooting and defense.\n\nPutting White on Team USA isn't totally fair to the Celtics, as the Olympics roster already features Tatum and Jrue Holiday. Boston played the longest of any team into the postseason, and now it will put even more miles on their bodies before having a chance to defend the title.\n\nThe Celtics face even more challenges because they will be holding an early training camp and play in Abu Dhabi. There will be some tired Celtics when the playoffs roll around next year.\n\nUltimately, it was White's choice to agree to accept the invitation. He's earned that due to his fantastic play over the past few seasons. The selection committee should have taken that decision out of his hands, though, both for his benefit as well as the team's.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Derrick%20White%20and%20Kawhi%20Leonard%20071024%20USA.jpeg?itok=Q9t_n_5b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The United States are one of 12 countries who will be competing in men's basketball in the 2024 Paris Olympics, and per usual, they have a stacked roster. The best American talent is teaming up again in a trend that has occurred in every summer Olympics since the Dream Team took form in 1992.\n\nThe 2024 squad is being coined as the Redeem Team 2.0, as Team USA is out for revenge after not medaling at the 2023 FIBA World Cup. The United States has revamped the basketball roster and assembled a squad consisting of true megastar players in the quest to bring home Olympic gold for the 17th time. In this article, we will take a look at exactly who it is that will lace up their shoes and step foot on the hardwood for Team USA. Here are all 12 players on the United States' roster, ranked.\n\n12. Jrue Holiday: Boston Celtics - Los Angeles, California\n\nJrue Holiday isn't the high-level scorer or an MVP-caliber player like some of his Team USA teammates, but he will serve as the team's glue. Holiday brings in winning experience and a winning style of play. He is fresh off contributing to his second championship in the NBA, this one of which came in his first season with the Boston Celtics.\n\nHoliday might not be the megastar that his Olympic peers are, but he will surely find minutes in Steve Kerr's rotation. On a team where everyone needs touches, yet there is only one ball to go around, Holiday will be a player who doesn't need to get too many shots up.\n\nHis usage rate will be low offensively, and he can instead focus on being the defensive hound that he is. Holiday is one of the best perimeter defensive players in the world, and defense will be his role for the United States.\n\n11. Derrick White: Boston Celtics - Parker, Colorado\n\nKawhi Leonard is out, and Derrick White is in for the United States Olympic men's basketball roster. Leonard, who earned the 12th and final roster spot, has been in jeopardy of losing his spot for weeks because of lingering injury issues. Now, Jrue Holiday's backcourt partner takes his place, and we have White ranked just above Holiday in these rankings.\n\nWhite took his game to new heights last season. He has forever been an elite defensive player, but he improved drastically on offense during a year when many thought he was worthy of an All-Star spot. Now, Team USA has three players who are fresh off of a championship, and that certainly won't hurt as the Americans try and become world champions at the Olympics.\n\nWhite is a somewhat comparable player to Holiday, and he only edges him out on the Team USA player rankings because he was a more effective scorer last season. He will do a lot of similar things to Holiday for this roster, though. Defense and hustle will be the priority for the guard who has worked his way up from Division II basketball all the way to the highest basketball stage in the world.\n\n10. Tyrese Haliburton: Indiana Pacers - Oshkosh, Wisconsin\n\nTyrese Haliburton ranked outside the top 10 for the best players on Team USA when we first wrote this article, but that should not be viewed as a slight. Now, he nudges into the top 10 with Kawhi Leonard's departure from the team.\n\nThe fact that the Pacers' point guard was able to make the Olympic roster despite being only 24 years old is extremely impressive. Haliburton has established himself as one of the best up-and-coming players in the NBA, and the basketball world got to know him well as he led an elite offensive team in the Pacers all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHaliburton is an offensive engine, and he makes the Pacers run on that side of the ball. Part of the reason for Indiana's offensive success his because of Haliburton's scoring ability. Although it is unorthodox, the Iowa State product gets shots to fall. However, scoring his not his primary role with the Pacers, and it definitely won't be on Team USA.\n\nAs mentioned with Holiday, there are only so many shots to go around, so Haliburton will focus on what he does best, and that is playmaking. Haliburton is one of the best passers in the world, and he just led the NBA in assists per game. He will focus on setting up his teammates for easy looks in the Paris Olympics.\n\n9. Bam Adebayo: Miami Heat - High Point, North Carolina\n\nTeam USA has an impressive center rotation, as Bam Adebayo will only be the team's third-stringer at that position despite being a top-five center in the NBA. The big man's unique skillset will be incredibly valuable for the Americans, though. Adebayo has traditional big man skills. He is an incredible rebounder and one of the best rim protectors in the world. He can also score effectively in the painted area.\n\nIt is the things that he does that most centers can't do that separates him, though. Adebayo has the rare ability for a big man to put the ball on the ground and make something happen off of the bounce. He is also one of the best passing centers in the NBA. The United States will be playing a number of European teams, where passing big men are more of the norm, so having a center who can do that in their own right will be valuable.\n\n8. Anthony Davis: Los Angeles Lakers - Chicago, Illinois\n\nAnthony Davis is one of two Lakers players on the Team USA roster. His level of play last season and recent statistics are extremely close to his Los Angeles teammate, who we will get to in a second. Davis is fresh off of his best and healthiest season in years, and the United States will hope he can bring that momentum to the Olympics.\n\nDavis is an elite shot blocker, and he will be one of many bigs making life hard for Olympic opponents in the paint. He also has an impressive offensive game. Although his shooting efficiency was down last year, Davis is more than capable as a jump shooter, and he always has a dominant interior game to fall back onto.\n\n7. LeBron James: Los Angeles Lakers - Akron, Ohio\n\nLeBron James is one of the best basketball players ever and still playing at an extremely high level. While entering year 22 in the NBA, though, the kid from Akron is no longer the clear-cut best player in the NBA like he once was. In fact, he only ranks as the seventh best player on Team USA's roster this year.\n\nEven so, what James is doing is defying the odds, unlike anything we've seen from a basketball player before. James is more than deserving of a spot to play with the United States in Paris, and the leadership he possesses and the respect he has from his teammates will be vital for a run at Olympic gold.\n\nTo this day, James is still a versatile player. He is a freak athlete who can score, rebound, and assist at a high level. James first played in the Olympics back in 2004, and he has always done a little bit of everything for Team USA. He ranks top five in points (273), rebounds (95), three-pointers (95), and steals (36), and his 88 assists are the most in Team USA's history.\n\nKing James skipped the last two Olympics, but he is back now, 20 years after first suited up for Team USA. The team won't be as reliant on him as they have been in the past, but he will still play a big role in Paris.\n\n6. Devin Booker: Phoenix Suns - Moss Point, Mississippi\n\nDevin Booker started in five of Team USA's six games in the 2020 Olympics. It is still to be determined whether Booker will be a starter again this year or if he will come off of the bench. Either way, Booker is arguably the best shooting guard in the world, and he will have a big impact in Paris.\n\nBooker can score at will from all three levels of the floor. His shot making will be a nightmare for opposing defenses, especially considering they can't give him their undivided attention with so many other stars on the team. After a disappointing first-round exit in the 2024 NBA playoffs, Booker will look for redemption in the Olympic Games.\n\n5. Jayson Tatum: Boston Celtics - St. Louis, Missouri\n\nAn Olympic gold medal would make it quite the summer for Jayson Tatum. He already won the NBA Finals, so a championship in Paris would make it a plentiful summer for winning for the Celtics star. Tatum is a two-way player who has been atop of the basketball world his whole career.\n\nTatum has made it to at least the conference finals in five of his seven NBA seasons, and he already won a gold medal in the 2020 Olympics. Experience under the bright lights is not an issue for Tatum, despite being only 26 years old, and he is surely riding an all-time confidence high after the NBA postseason.\n\n4. Kevin Durant: Phoenix Suns - Washington, DC\n\nKevin Durant is the best player in Team USA history, yet he only ranks fourth for the most talented players on the team this year. Team USA's record books are littered with Durant's name. He has won gold all four times he played for Team USA, including the three prior times he was in the Olympics.\n\nOther countries have not been able to figure out how to slow Durant down. He ranks first in Team USA history in points (435), three-pointers (74), and free throws (69). Durant scored 156 points in the 2012 Olympics and 155 points in the 2016 Olympics, both of which rank first and second for single-tournament scoring in Team USA history. He even has the highest single-tournament point per game average from when he scored 20.7 points per game in the 2020 Olympics.\n\nDurant has been a go-to scorer throughout his basketball career, both in the NBA and for the United States. This is illustrated by the Team USA record 38 points he put up against Lithuania in the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\nThe current Phoenix Suns star hasn't slowed down when it comes to putting the basketball in the bucket, either. Durant can score any way he wants, and that will likely remain true in the 2024 Olympics. The Slim Reaper is nearly 7-foot tall, yet he is unstoppable in the mid-range, from deep, and off the drive.\n\n3. Anthony Edwards: Minnesota Timberwolves - Atlanta, Georgia\n\nRanking Anthony Edwards above a player as accomplished in world play as Kevin Durant was hard, but Ant Man announced himself to the world as one of the five or six best active basketball players during the Timberwolves run to the Western Conference Finals. While Durant is in the twilight of his career, Edwards is just getting started.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the former first overall pick isn't ready to make an impact now, though. He has the killer mentality and will to win of a champion. Edwards has already confirmed that he believes that he is Team USA's number one option, and he believes that the team should revolve around him.\n\nWhile you can chop up Edwards' comments to his playful personality, his belief in himself isn't delusional. Edwards was by far Team USA's best player last year during the 2023 FIBA World Cup, and the United States men's basketball team didn't really get going until after Edwards cemented his place as the squad's top dog. Edwards will need to embrace a team-first approach during the Olympics, but he has the skills the dominate the competition.\n\n2. Steph Curry: Golden State Warriors - Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nSurprisingly, this will be Steph Curry's first time on an Olympic roster. Despite having tons of success in FIBA play, Curry has never actually suited up for Team USA at their highest stage. Curry is now finally adding that to his resume; a resume that already has tons of accolades.\n\nAs the NBA's all-time three-point leader, Curry is already the best shooter the game has ever seen, and he even has a case as the best point guard ever. His prowess from deep will help spread the floor for the rest of the great athletes playing for the United States. Curry has also long been an underrated playmaker, and that attribute will be valued amongst his teammates.\n\nCurry already has two gold medals, but both came in the FIBA World Cup/Championship. An Olympic gold is the missing hardware for Curry's career.\n\n1. Joel Embiid: Philadelphia 76ers - Cameroon\n\nJoel Embiid is the one player who wasn't born in the United States who will be playing for Team USA. The Cameroon native moved to the United States to focus on basketball when he was 16 years old, and he has been a citizen since 2022. Embiid is also a citizen of France, so his decision to play for the United States over France or Cameroon was controversial for some.\n\nTeam USA is more than happy to have him, though, as he is arguably the team's best player. Embiid has finished second or first in NBA MVP voting in three of the last four seasons, and he was the frontrunner to win the NBA's most prestigious individual award last season before he went down with an injury.\n\nEmbiid is a dominant big man, capable of forcing his will inside and using high-level skill outside. All three American centers are inside-outside players on both sides of the play, which will give Team USA plenty of schematic options to utilize.\n\nStarters\n\nThe basketball community is wondering how Steve Kerr will navigate playing time for such a loaded roster. That predicament will be a lot harder for the Golden State Warriors/Team USA coach now than it was during FIBA play last year, and we still don't even know who will start for the team.\n\nOur best guess is Steph Curry will be Kerr's first choice to start. Obviously Kerr has familiarity with the point guard who has played the last 10 seasons for him, and the duo have won four championships together. Curry won't get the starting gig just because he is close with Kerr, though, but he is more than worthy of starting at the point guard position.\n\nCurry's three-point shooting prowess makes everything easier on his teammates, so he is the perfect fit in the starting lineup, as spacing is always key in the modern game. Additionally, Curry is by far the team's best lead guard as the point guard position is arguably Team USA's weakest, considering Jrue Holiday and Tyrese Haliburton ranked at the end of the above list.\n\nAlongside Curry in the backcourt, we think Devin Booker will get the nod. Booker was Team USA's starting shooting guard in the last Olympics in which they won the gold, so it doesn't make much sense to fix something that isn't broken.\n\nBooker's teammate, Kevin Durant, makes the most sense to start at the small forward spot. Durant is not only familiar with his Suns teammate, but he also previously played under Kerr and alongside Curry with the Warriors. Durant's chemistry with the starters is one reason to start him, but the obvious one is he is Team USA's most accomplished Olympic player ever.\n\nAlthough we didn't rank LeBron James in the top five current Team USA players, we can't see a world where he isn't a starter. Sacrifices have to be made on the Olympic team, but James has started 1,490 of his 1,492 NBA games. James isn't the type of player who comes off of the bench, and he has done enough in his career to warrant a starting spot.\n\nWe think the starters will be rounded out with Joel Embiid at the five. Plenty of fans have made a case that the 76ers center is the best player in the world, and his two-way talent will fit great alongside the other starters.\n\nLineups\n\nIt is possible we see Kerr use platoon swaps to get in substitutes, and there are likely situations for all 12 players on the roster to play. If there is a clear-cut sixth man, though, we think it will be Anthony Edwards. Edwards gained the trust of Kerr during the FIBA World Cup, and the Timberwolves star has the raw scoring ability to work as a spark plug scorer off of the bench on this roster.\n\nKerr will likely use players situationally, rather than having a well-defined rotation. He played all 12 of his players in all eight of the FIBA World Cup games in 2023, so a player being stuck on the bench likely isn't realistic. If Kerr does limit his rotation to 10 players, then Bam Adebayo and Tyrese Haliburton are the two players most likely to get the short end of the stick.\n\nAdebayo is almost certainly only going to be the team's third option at center, and it is hard to find minutes for three big men. Meanwhile, Haliburton is the second youngest player on the team, and there is a world where he loses minutes to the more defensive-minded Jrue Holiday.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com",

KD and LeBron James will be making their fourth appearance at the Olympics. His three gold medal haul in the games is the most among its current team members.\n\nLooking back at his history playing for the flag in the Olympics, Team USA's all-time leading scorer thinks that the 2024 Dream Team is the deepest team he's played on.\n\n\"It is definitely the deepest team I've played on since I've been with USAB,\" said KD during an interview with Yahoo's Vincent Goodwill. \"From top to bottom, everybody is the guy on their team. \"\n\nThe More star-studded team\n\nDurant was the team captain of the last U.S. Olympic Dream Team. That team lost to France in their 2021 Olympic opener but came on strong and got its revenge over the Frenchmen in the gold medal game. But after last year's U.S. men's basketball team to the FIBA World Cup three times and finished just in fourth place, USAB had to enlist the best team possible for Paris.\n\nAside from Durant, USAB is also returning Devin Booker, Bam Adebayo, Jrue Holiday, and Jayson Tatum for a second straight Olympics. But with guys like LeBron James, Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis, the 2024 U.S. men's basketball team is definitely the more star-studded team than its immediate predecessor.\n\n\"I mean, the last Olympics we had a couple of younger, you know, role players in the league that grinded their way up in camp and got that opportunity, which was cool, but they wasn't like the best players on it. Like these guys are Hall of Famers, all-stars, you know, so I'm excited about this,\" added Durant.\n\nThe best American players available\n\nThat 2021 team had role players Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee stepping in for Brad Beal and Kevin Love. But even if you had the original members, the 2024 Dream Team still pales in terms of star power and depth.\n\nWhen Durant played for the Rio Olympics in 2016, his team also had players like Deandre Jordan, Draymond Green, and Kyle Lowry, who, while former all-stars, were more role players when they made the team. In 2012, KD also played with guys like Andre Iguodala, Tyson Chandler, and Deron Williams, who, while All-Stars and DPOY that year, weren't really the best players that USAB could send.\n\nHowever, after the close call in 2021 and last year's debacle, USAB isn't taking any chances for the 2024 Paris Olympics. They are sending arguably the best team - at least on paper, possible. It may not be better than the original Dream Team. Still, it's definitely the deepest among the four teams Durant has played for.", "source": {"uri": "basketballnetwork.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Basketball Network - Your daily dose of basketball"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@basketballnetwork.net", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keldon_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keldon Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Chandler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Chandler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaVale_McGee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JaVale McGee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deron_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deron Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.basketballnetwork.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk1OTM5OTg4OTcyNTEyMjgy/kevin-durant.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Boston Celtics point guard and recent NBA champion Jrue Holiday might've been the only one in the video wearing someone else's signature sneaker as he donned the Nike Sabrina 2.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers star LeBron James laced up his Nike LeBron 21. Whereas Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star Anthony Edwards could not wait to break into his Adidas AE1 Low editions on the court.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers star center Joel Embiid was rocking the Skechers SKX while fans got to see Kawhi Leonard grinning ear to ear as he was putting his New Balance Kawhi 4 in Team USA colors to test on the floor.\n\nThe team comprised for the Olympics this year headlines three superstars, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry. This will be the first time all three players will be playing on a national team together. And based on the talent of these three players alone, it is understandable for KG to be hyped.\n\nMany have considered Team USA to be overpowered and unfair to the rest of the world. However, there are some other national teams to look out for in the upcoming Paris Olympics.

The Olympic 5\u00d75 Men's Basketball draw and schedule are out and the United States is in Group C with Serbia, Puerto Rico, and South Sudan. To win the group and advance to the quarterfinals, Team USA -- which includes former Kentucky Wildcats Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, and Bam Adebayo -- will have to take down one of the top players in the NBA, a fellow former Cat, and some former Louisville Cardinals.\n\nTeam USA will begin play vs. Serbia on Sunday, July 28 at 11:15 a.m. ET on NBC. Serbia is led by Nikola Jokic, a six-time NBA All-Star, three-time NBA MVP, and the MVP of the 2023 NBA Finals. NBA players Bogdan Bogdanovic, Aleksej Pokusevski, and Vasilije Micic are also on the Serbian National Team, which finished in the top ten of the FIBA Eurobasket Tournament in 2022.\n\nA few days later, Team USA will face South Sudan, whose roster includes former Cat Wenyen Gabriel, who played with Bam Adebayo on the 2016-17 Kentucky team. Bol Bol, the son of NBA Hall of Famer Manute Bol, is also on South Sudan's team, along with Thon Maker and former Louisville Cardinals Carlik Jones, Deng Adel, and Mangok Mathiang. That game takes place on Wednesday, July 31 at 3 p.m. ET on NBC.\n\nTeam USA will close group play with Puerto Rico on Saturday, August 3 at 11:15 a.m. ET on NBC. New Orleans Pelicans point guard Jose Alvarado is the most well-known name on Puerto Rico's squad, but you'll also recognize Tremont Waters, who played for LSU from 2017-19.\n\nTeam USA is the favorite to bring home gold for the seventeenth time. In addition to a trio of former Cats, the roster includes LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Edwards. Steve Kerr serves as head coach of the squad, which has won gold in the last four Olympic Games. Devin Booker and Bam Adebayo were part of the team that took home gold from Tokyo in 2021, while Anthony Davis hasn't suited up for the national team since 2012 when Team USA brought home gold from London.\n\nTeam USA will warm up for Paris in the USA Basketball Showcase, an exhibition series featuring Canada, Australia, Serbia, South Sudan, and Germany in Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, and London. Team USA's first game is tomorrow night vs. Canada, whose roster includes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Trey Lyles, Jamal Murray, and RJ Barrett. You can watch it live Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. on FS1.\n\nThe game comes at the end of Team USA's training camp, which started late last week in Las Vegas. For the past several days, the 12-man roster has been practicing and scrimmaging against one another and the USA Select Team, which includes current NBA or G League players and Duke incoming freshman Cooper Flagg, who apparently is stealing the show. The current Kentucky team will get to face Flagg and the Blue Devils in the Champions Classic in November in Atlanta.\n\nHere are some more sights and sounds from training camp:", "source": {"uri":

After cutting Steve Kerr, Sean Elliott, Rex Chapman and Mark Macon and struggling to score in a 1988 semifinal loss to the Soviet Union, John Thompson said, \"The people that we have, we made the decision to take.\" As FIBA unconscionably gave the Soviets three chances to inbound the ball after Doug Collins appeared to have clinched victory for the U.S. in the 1972 gold medal game, coach Hank Iba refused the suggestions from staff members to pull his team off the floor. \"I don't want to lose this game later tonight, sitting on my butt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThere they are: Three of the greatest coaches in the history of the game. Brown is the only man to coach champions in both the NBA and NCAA. Thompson is the first Black coach to win the NCAA Division I title. Iba was the first ever to win NCAA championships in consecutive years. And for each of them, regardless of all they accomplished, an American loss at the Olympics remains a stain on each of their resumes.\n\nWhy would any coach want to step into such a thankless position?\n\nAnd why would any player sign up to play?\n\n\"How can you not? How can you not want to do this?\" Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton told The Sporting News. \"We watched our role models and guys that we looked up to represent USA Basketball, and I knew I wanted to be a part of that. Because people that I looked up to were part of that, and people they looked up to were part of that.\n\n\"I think that's the great part about USA Basketball is you're right: There is a gold standard. Especially in the United States, it's gold medal or you fail. But I think that pressure is good for us. That pressure is exciting.\"\n\nMORE: LeBron James, Kevin Durant headline Team USA roster for 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nThe USA Basketball men's Olympic team began gathering in Las Vegas July 5 for a four-day training camp in advance of the first exhibition game, July 10 against Canada (FS1, 10:30 p.m. ET). The team will remain together in advance of the July 28 Group C opener, with two exhibition games scheduled for each of Abu Dhabi and London.\n\nBefore Haliburton, Anthony Edwards and Jayson Tatum, there was the Redeem Team of LeBron, CP3 and Kobe. Before them, there was the Dream Team of MJ, Magic and Bird. And before all that, there were two sets of collegians whose mission was to retrieve the gold medal that had been forfeited (Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin in 1984, following the 1980 boycott of the Moscow Games) or stolen (Phil Ford, Adrian Dantley and Scott May, after the debacle of 1972). And before them there was the transcendent 1960 group featuring icons Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas and Jerry West, who won their eight Olympic games by a composite 339 points and went on to transform the way the sport was played at the NBA level.\n\nMORE: Full schedule for men's, women's USA Olympic teams\n\nEvery one of those players understood the mission, and the consequences. It was a little like what Tatum faced in the most recent NBA playoffs. For the Boston Celtics to fall short of a championship after they'd won 64 regular-season games, and after they'd reached the conference finals in three of the previous four seasons, would have been adjudicated as a colossal failure. With the Olympics, though, the wait to try again is four years.\n\nIt was different for Haliburton. The Pacers hadn't been in the playoffs since 2020, and this was his first full season with the team. Reaching the Eastern Conference finals was an impressive step for the team, and he was a huge reason for the advance. Although there was significant disappointment in their inability to take their best shot - Haliburton injured his hamstring in Game 2 against the Celtics and didn't return to the series - the Pacers accomplished a lot.\n\n\"We're all competitors. We all want to win. I think there are some guys on our team who - they deal with that every postseason, as well,\" Haliburton said. \"I think that's just a part of public perception and a part of us as competitors. I wanted to be a part of that.\"\n\nThe men's basketball competition has been staged at the Olympics 20 times, at every games since 1936. The United States has won 16 of those, or 80 percent. They failed to medal just once - because their nation boycotted the 1980 Games in Moscow. They have played 149 total games over the years. They've lost six times. That's a .960 winning percentage established over nearly a century.\n\nThey've won the past four Olympic gold medals.\n\n\"This is a unique experience,\" USA head coach Steve Kerr told reporters. \"The NBA season is a marathon, and FIBA is really more of a sprint - especially for Team USA. We generally have a different team every summer, whereas a lot of the teams that we're playing against have the continuity that comes with having a very similar roster year after year.\n\n\"Our strength is the depth of talent that we have in this country ... We have to try to mold the team quickly, and that comes via practice but also with travel and bonding, with the experience of flying overseas and playing in different venues, different cultures.\"\n\nMORE: Anthony Edwards call himself 'No. 1 option' for Team USA\n\nThe strength of USA Basketball since 2005, since former Suns owner and USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo recruited Duke's Mike Krzyzewski to rejuvenate the senior men's program, has been getting the best to participate. Kevin Durant already owns three gold medals. LeBron James has two. Anthony Davis, Devin Booker and Tatum have one each.\n\nThey're back again, though, and taking on what could be viewed as thankless challenge is to be admired.\n\n\"I think winning the gold medal is the top of the sport - that and the NBA Championship,\" Haliburton said. \"I don't think anything you can do individually can trump those. We play this game to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton",

Shoot my shots, play defense. They've got to fit in to play around me.

Now that Team USA's training camp has begun, Embiid discussed playing for Team USA as a longtime dream.\n\n\"It means so much. It's been a dream for a long time. It's an electric group of guys, especially with such great players and the type of talent that you have. It's fun to be a part of.\"\n\nEmbiid wants to enjoy the experience and learn how to play with these elite stars around him.\n\n\"Just enjoying it. I play against them so I feel like I know a lot about them, but just being around them, and learning how to play with each other.\"\n\nEmbiid averaged 34.7 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 5.6 assists in 39 games last season, losing out on a potential MVP campaign and another scoring title due to the injuries that kept him out for over half the season. Despite the struggles he had with health over the season, Embiid is determined to represent Team USA and be one of their most impactful players.\n\nEmbiid chose to represent Team USA over France or his home country of Cameroon in a decision many have derided him for, especially because he turned down France. With his arrival, Team USA has finally filled the center hole which has limited them at previous international tournaments.\n\nJoel Embiid Will Do Whatever It Takes To Win\n\nEmbiid spoke candidly about his participation on Team USA this season. The center discussed how he feels he won't be bullied by other centers and how excited he is to play in a lineup with all-time NBA legends.\n\n\"Everybody knows it's hard to bully me, and it's hard to bully those other guys. I think we've got enough size and basketball IQ. ... Honestly, I'm just excited to get the ball in the post and having Steph, [Kevin Durant], 'Bron cutting.\"\n\nEmbiid's dedication to winning at the Olympics knows no bounds, with the center saying he'd be willing to take 0 shots and only play defense due to the incredible caliber of his teammates.\n\n\"I'm playing with a lot of great, amazing basketball players. So if I've got to take zero shots and play defense, I'm happy with it. ... I don't see [my teammates] as competition. I just want to enjoy them.\"\n\nThe 2023 NBA MVP may have upset fans by declaring for Team USA instead of France, but it was a decision he made as someone who went to school and college in the United States before building a life in the country. His children are full American citizens and the country has given Embiid all the professional glory he's received.\n\nHe is more American than French anyway, with Embiid not having the professional or familial ties with France that he has with the United States. Now that he's made the decision to represent the greatest basketball nation in the world, he has to live up to their trust in him by dominating opposing big men during the Olympics.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Led by Olympic legends such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant and flanked by the games' latest stars like Anthony Edwards and Bam Adebayo, the USA go into the Olympics looking to repeat as gold medal winners, but are looking for redemption after failing to medal in the FIBA World Cup. The old guard like James and Durant are coming in for one last ride after not playing in the Tokyo Olympics, but this is also the debut appearance for Stephen Curry and Joel Embiid. While the US is still believed to win the whole thing, the rest of the world is catching up, and Team USA needs a strong showing in Paris to solidify their place at the top of the basketball world.\n\nHere's how Team USA shakes out on their quest for gold in Paris.\n\nTeam USA are in Group C, along with Serbia, Puerto Rico and South Sudan.\n\nSerbia are led by perennial MVP candidate Nikola Jokic, along with NBA players Nikola Jovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Aleksej Pokusevski and Vasilije Micic. Of course, Jokic will be the one to get all of the attention, but the Serbian national team has had their fair share of success in international play, most recently finishing in the top ten of the FIBA Eurobasket tournament in 2022.\n\nSouth Sudan might not have the star talent of Serbia or Team USA, but they have a lot of length and defensive potential. Led by NBA players Bol Bol, Wenyen Gabriel and JT Thor, South Sudan is going to be a problem on the defensive side of the court. Most will remember Puerto Rico for the 92-73 beatdown they gave the USA in 2004 when former Utah Jazz guard Carlos Arroyo scored 24 points. Well Puerto Rico is back in the Olympics after a thrilling victory in qualifying over Lithuania, where New Orleans Pelicans PG Jose Alvarado scored 23 points. You can see how much the Olympic berth means to Alvarado and Arroyo, who were in tears after the victory:\n\nHere's what the USA's fixtures will look like in group play:\n\nFrom there, the US will enter the quarterfinals where their opponent is based on how many games they win in group play. The quarterfinals will start Aug. 6.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_acosta@sbnation.com", "name": "Joseph Acosta", "type":

Years of hearing how the \"world is catching up\" and one year removed from a pathetic fourth place showing at the FIBA World Cup has lit a fire under the United State to prove its still the dominant global force in basketball, and that nobody can touch Team USA when it sends its best players.\n\nCouched in the discussion of global basketball in Paris is Joel Embiid, who has chosen to represent Team USA at the games. A Cameroon national who moved to the USA at age 16, Embiid's participation in the games is being slammed on social media, fueled by accounts with large followings branding Embiid's decision as \"taking the easy way out.\"\n\nIs there anything to this? Is it fair to label Embiid as a medal-chaser? No -- and also no.\n\nIn the above tweet, which has been liked over 35,000 times and shared almost 4,000 times it positions Jose Alvarado as a paragon of virtue for lifting Puerto Rico up by its bootstraps, while Embiid simply accepted a position on a team that was given to him.\n\nHere's the problem: Alvarado wasn't born in Puerto Rico. He was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Queens -- and didn't accept an invite to join Puerto Rico until 2022, when he was actively recruited by national team manager Carlos Delfino.\n\nAlvarado has Puerto Rican heritage through his father, but has no further connection prior to 2022 when he was actively courted by the team to play for them. Of course, none of this really matters either because ...\n\nAnthropologists and sociologists have agreed on this point in peer-reviewed journals as early as the 1960s. The essential argument is that geopolitics and colonialism have no fundamental bearing on which ethnic groups or nationalities that someone identifies with.\n\nThis was of particular prevalence during more overt colonial periods where nations were under clearer foreign occupation and governance, such as England's control over India, Dutch rule in South Africa, and Eastern Bloc states which were part of the USSR.\n\nIn these cases native, indigenous people rarely identified with their occupiers socially, culturally, or anthropologically, which led to a school of thought which mandated that personal identity was far more important to ethnicity and nationality than simply a factor of where someone was born.\n\nNow, Embiid might considered a more extreme case since he didn't move to the USA until age 16, but that's of no consequence sociologically. He has lived his entire adult life in the United States, he has chosen to raise a child here, in two years time he will have spent more time in the USA than he did in Cameroon. If he personally identifies as \"American,\" then that's all that matters.\n\nPart of what makes the Embiid story more pronounced was a global \"courtship\" of sorts, which saw Cameroon, USA, and France all being potential teams Embiid would join. A driving force behind much of the ire isn't coming from Cameroon (which didn't qualify for the Olympics in the first place), but France, who feels like they were spurned by Embiid when he was granted French citizenship and expected to play for the host nation, only to change his mind and join Team USA.\n\nEssentially we have a 30-year-old NBA MVP whose country of birth didn't qualify for the Olympics, and he was coveted by numerous countries. In the past we've seen some frankly hilarious examples of players representing other countries for the Olympics either because their birth country didn't qualify, they had no chance of getting on Team USA, or they believed their medal chances were better playing for another nation.\n\nAll of the above were accepted as fine, largely because they were mid-tier players and not elite NBA superstars. Still, this doesn't change the fundamental fact that people have been choosing their nationalities forever when it comes to the Olympic games.\n\nIt's unclear what the future holds in basketball for Joel Embiid. The Sixers once again figure to be in the mix for an NBA championship -- especially with the addition of Paul George, but that has also been the case for much of Embiid's career. Philadelphia routinely fall short of expectations, and now as injuries rear their head and Embiid rounds 30 there's a very good chance the Paris Olympics will be his best chance to win a major team award in basketball.\n\nTrying to dunk on Embiid for not representing Cameroon is dumb. It's been established that ethnicity and nationality are a personal decision which shouldn't be defined by geographic boundaries -- and even if they were there's been an established history of players competing for other nations when it comes to the games.\n\nAt the end of the day Embiid is free to play where he wants in the Olympics, and while there was a prolonged process to work out where he would play, we don't get to decide if he's worthy of representing Team USA. That's up for Embiid and the selection committee to decide, and they made their decision.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's fine, but you better win.", "body": "LAS VEGAS -- The question was simple. The answer was blunt.\n\nI asked Team USA center Joel Embiid if he was looking forward to facing Serbia's Nikola Jokic in the opening game of the Olympics group phase on July 28.\n\n\"I don't care about Jokic,\" Embiid said after a spirited scrimmage Wednesday at UNLV's practice gym. \"I'm playing for my national team.\"\n\nWait. What? Activate the Nuggets Nation group chat. Let's head over to Speer Boulevard and raise some Troel Embiid signs. Or maybe even raise a few missing persons milk cartons in his honor.\n\nEmbiid remains an easy target for Nuggets fans' vitriol. He hasn't played in Denver since 2019. When he sat out in January as a late scratch with a sore knee, he made a little boy cry. The kid's birthday present was a flight to Ball Arena from California to see his favorite player. Instead, all he got was overpriced concessions and flimsy napkins to wipe his tears.\n\nWhen Embiid responded the way he did Wednesday, my knee-jerk reaction was to sizzle him like everything else in the desert's 117-degree heat. Put Embiid anywhere in the country, and he's Wilt Chamberlain with better range. Place him in Denver, and he's Kris Bryant -- a ghost in street clothes.\n\nBut this is the thing about the Olympics. It is more \"we\" than \"me.\" And while Embiid makes Nuggets fans' skin crawl, his response was not wrong. Irritating. Annoying. But not wrong.\n\nWhile he should care about Jokic -- and he better, because there are no trainer's rooms to escape to in France -- Embiid's priorities are more macro than micro. And that is appropriate with the first game three weeks away.\n\n\"It's all about focusing on ourselves and trying to make sure everybody is on the same page,\" Embiid said. \"When we get there, we don't know what we gotta focus on. But right now it's about getting better.\"\n\nThe race is on. When it comes to Team USA and the Olympics, there is no second place. There are no Capri Suns, orange slices or flaky croissants for effort. There is the gold medal. Nothing else. The Americans have won four straight.\n\nWatching Team USA practice against the American Select Team, it is clear the red, white and blue remain a work in progress. Incoming Duke freshman Cooper Flagg, only 17, was the best player on the floor during the media viewing period. He drained 3s, put defenders on skates and delivered a one-handed, flailing put-back on a missed jump shot that featured everything but an exclamation point.\n\nIt circles back to what Embiid was saying. Team USA needs reps together. Nobody cares that the players have only 40 days to microwave chemistry, while showing humility and character. Egos must be checked like charter baggage.\n\n\"I think our country is going to be very proud of our team,\" Team USA coach Steve Kerr said.\n\nIn 1992, there was The Dream Team, anchored by Michael Jordan. In 2008, there was the Redeem Team, led by Kobe Bryant. In 2024, there will be the Meme Team if the Americans don't stand on the highest podium. This is the reality when a squad features 12 potential Hall of Famers.\n\n\"That's the standard of USA Basketball. It's never going to change. That's the honor and privilege of wearing this jersey, and I don't think any of us would have it any other way,\" said Pacers star guard Tyrese Haliburton. \"I think we all welcome the pressure.\"\n\nThere is a sense of urgency that wasn't necessary 32 years ago when Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and Larry Bird wandered into Barcelona like the Beatles. The days of rolling out the basketballs, routing an inferior opponent and signing autographs on the court afterwards have long since vanished.\n\nRemember, the Americans lost their first game at the Tokyo Games in 2020, spent several days staving off elimination and barely claimed the gold medal with a nervy 87-82 victory over France.\n\nFive players return from that team, including Kevin Durant and Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum, a newly minted champion. It is a reminder that Embiid's apathy toward Jokic -- as silly as it is -- can serve a purpose.\n\n\"It's about trying to win a gold medal. That's all that matters. Not who's starting or how many points you average,\" Tatum said. \"All that matters is that we come home with a gold medal. Having that mindset, guys understand that they have to change a little bit. We all have to change in our roles.\"\n\nEmbiid is chief among them. Despite checking in at 7 feet, 280 pounds, Embiid lives on the perimeter. In the international game, that must change. Team USA needs him to spend more time around the basket than the Easter Bunny.\n\n\"He's a very dominant scorer down low,\" Kerr said. \"He (typically) spends a lot of time near the foul line, and he's good there. And we will get him the ball there. But his physicality and ability to score in the FIBA game is going to be very important.\"\n\nIt begins with a Game 1 matchup against Jokic. A faceoff between the two most recent MVPs. There is no time for feelings. No one will care what Embiid thinks about the Nuggets icon if the Americans avoid red faces and win gold in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver

But with Team USA, coach Steve Kerr anticipates Embiid playing more in the low post than in the NBA.\n\nThat's because of the size the U.S. will face during the Olympics in Paris, from France's Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, to Serbia's Nikola Jokic. There are also looser basket interference rules in FIBA competition, allowing players to touch the ball off the rim even if it is still in the imaginary cylinder. On the opposite end of the floor, there is no defensive three seconds violation.\n\n\" READ MORE: Joel Embiid joins Team USA at training camp, taking another step toward Olympic dream\n\n\"His physicality and his ability to score [down low] in the FIBA game should be really good,\" Kerr said of Embiid following Monday's practice at UNLV.

Canada is peppered with NBA talent such as 2024 NBA MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, and Dillion Brooks. The Americans, however, boast a star-studded roster headlined by LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, and Kevin Durant. They are all now on a fast track to gain on-court chemistry.\n\n\"When you're playing with some of the great players of all time, you've got to adjust,\" Embiid said. \"You've got to learn how to play.

The team features several superstars including LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant. Of course, with multiple stars comes debate. Bill Simmons took to his podcast to discuss whether James or Tatum should start for the summer team.\n\nSimmons began by making his proposition for Team USA's backcourt and frontcourt lineup before proposing the question on Tatum and James.\n\n\"Edwards and Curry as the back-court, Embiid as the Center, and I think Durant starts because he has that long Olympics thing. Then the next question for me is, is it Tatum or is it LeBron starting, and I can't imagine LeBron not starting,\" Simmons said, via the Bill Simmons podcast.\n\nSimmons' guest, Ryen Russillo, said James would start, which prompted an elaborate response.\n\n\"Tatum's not going to start? He just won the title. He's in his prime, he's like the perfect international player but I don't think he starts. I think Durant and LeBron start over him. So it's Embiid, Durant, LeBron, Edwards, Curry? Or does Kawhi get the Edwards spot? And they go Embiid, LeBron, Durant, Kawhi, Curry and they don't have a two guard,\" Simmons replied.\n\nBill Simmons brought up a valid point. Jayson Tatum is fresh off an NBA championship with the Celtics. In addition, Tatum made the All-NBA Third team after averaging 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 1.0 steals. However, LeBron James is also highly touted.\n\nJames has not seen as much success with the Los Angeles Lakers as he would like. Yet, he remains highly effective, as he made the All-NBA Third Team after the 2023-24 season.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Team USA handles its talent problems ahead of an exciting Olympics.\n\nAnother Team USA is under fire from fans before the Olympics\n\nOne of the other interesting points Simmons brought up was the health status of Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard. Leonard missed most of the 2024 NBA Playoffs with yet another devastating injury. Thus, fans are upset that he has elected to play for Team USA. ClutchPoints' Clippers Beat Reporter Tomer Azarly provided more insight on the matter.\n\n\"Kawhi Leonard is healthy enough to play with the Olympic team this summer, which is clearly a once in a lifetime opportunity. However, in recent weeks, fans have expressed their frustrations that Leonard is available to play for these Olympic Games, but not for the Clippers in the playoffs. In fact, Leonard has been affected by injury in four consecutive postseasons. He suffered the torn ACL during the 2021 playoffs, and the rehab also took him out of any availability for the 2022 play-in games which the Clippers lost,\" Azarly wrote.\n\nFans were unhappy with Leonard's newfound availability, but the star forward emphasized that his injuries were out of his control. He wanted to suit for Los Angeles in every postseason game he has missed. But unfortunately, he did not get a \"perfect script.\" Hopefully, Leonard stays healthy during his opportunity with Team USA. He, LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, and the rest of the team's stout contributors will go for gold once again.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bill-Simmons-debates-LeBron-James-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

One by one, some of the sport's greatest players -- LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard -- made their way through the Thomas & Mack Center doors for Team USA's four-day training camp.\n\n\"It was surreal in some instances,\" Gonzaga men's basketball coach and Team USA assistant Mark Few said. \"Just to have that type of talent ... all gathered in the same room. I mean, it's kind of an iconic group, and then to get them out there on the floor and watch how they interact and see what they bring. It was awesome.\"\n\nAs the group of 12 NBA All-Stars joined forces over the weekend during a record-high heat wave in Las Vegas, they expect to face a different kind of heat throughout their quest for a fifth consecutive gold medal in basketball.\n\nWhile the Americans have dominated the Olympics since the 1992 Dream Team set the standard, the rest of the world has upped its game over the past three decades. Look no further than the slew of foreign talent that has ascended to the top of the NBA -- four of the five players named to the 2023-24 All-NBA First Team weren't from U.S. soil. Over 1/4 of opening night rosters were filled with international players, headlined by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, former MVP and champion Nikola Jokic, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, and Victor Wembanyama.\n\n\"I mean, listen, [the players] get it. They're highly competitive, and they have a lot of pride,\" Few said. \"If we can just be aggressive, but be ourselves and be who we are, and especially at the defensive end, we should be in great shape.\"\n\nFew has been well aware of basketball's influence on the world during his time at Gonzaga, which has developed into quite a pipeline for foreigners looking to carve their path to the NBA. Four of his pupils -- Kelly Olynyk (Canada), Andrew Nembhard (Canada), Rui Hachimura (Japan) and Filip Petrusev (Serbia) -- appear poised to represent their respective home countries in Paris as well. Domantas Sabonis (Lithuania) has reached All-NBA caliber, while Brandon Clarke (Canada) could've represented the Canadians in the 2024 Games if not for an Achilles injury last year.\n\nThe Paris Games won't be Few's first taste of international competition either -- he served as head coach of the 2015 U.S. Pan American Men's Basketball Team, a squad composed of collegiate players that won the bronze medal. He was also was an assistant coach for the gold medalist 2012 USA U18 National Team. But the Americans have failed to medal in each of the past two FIBA World Cup tournaments.\n\nEven so, Few recognized last summer's fourth-place blunder in Manila as the turning point for Team USA. Not long after the 2023 FIBA World Cup, players like James, Curry and Durant voiced interest in wearing the red, white and blue for the Paris Games.\n\n\"I think probably one of the best things that happened is right after we got done last summer, I mean, these guys started volunteering that they were in [for USA Basketball] and for this right away,\" Few said. \"So I think that kind of shows that collective competitive spirit that they all have.\"\n\nWith the group of NBA All-Stars assembled, it's on Few and the coaching staff to figure out how all the pieces will fit together on the court. That is probably the best problem to ask for as a coach given the amount of flexibility and star power across the board, and one Few has managed numerous times over the years when constructing the Zags' rotation. In regard to handling these professional athletes, Few has a \"keep an eye on the prize\" mentality.\n\n\"Just telling everybody that probably the biggest thing is nobody will really remember who the leading scorer was on this team,\" Few said. \"We're all just going to be judged on how we finish. I mean, I would take it a step further and not even worry about that. If we could just tap out everything and get this entire group, if we could all play together and everybody brings their best, I mean, this thing would be pretty incredible.\"\n\nAside from predicting the starting five, plenty has been made in the media about who will play point guard between James or Curry -- a topic Few said \"everybody's making way too big of a deal\" given how \"position-less\" the roster is constructed.\n\nFew hammered home that point with what he felt was the best play from the team's first practice Saturday -- a dribble-handoff, or \"zoom action,\" between Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo, in which Davis found Adebayo for a score.\n\n\"Everybody's comfortable pushing the ball up the floor, and there's huge parts to this that are position-less in many ways,\" Few said.\n\n\"Again, we're just all driven to collectively come together and hopefully feel that this is bigger than all of us, or, our own individual accomplishments and what we have could be something really, really, really special that we'll all remember for the rest of our lives.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The squad has combined to have 78 All-Star Game appearances. No other team in USA Basketball history has combined to have over 70 combined all-star appearances.\n\nThe U.S. is coached by Warriors coach Steve Kerr, an alum of what is now known as Palisades Charter High School. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue is among the assistant coaches, along with Gonzaga coach Mark Few and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra.\n\nCanada's 15-player roster includes 10 NBA players, among them Houston Rockets forward Dillon Brooks, best remembered by Lakers fans for calling James old following Game 2 of a 2023 first-round playoff series when he played for the Memphis Grizzlies, and for getting ejected in Game 3 after receiving a flagrant foul for hitting James in the groin.\n\nThe team is coached by Brooklyn Nets coach Jordi Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez.\n\nThe U.S. tops the rankings under FIBA, basketball's international governing body and based on results in official FIBA competitions and their qualifiers over an eight-year-period. Canada is ranked seventh.\n\nThe 7:30 p.m. game will be televised by FS1.\n\nThe exhibition is the first of five for the U.S., which will next play Australia Monday at 9 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Americans will begin Olympic play July 28 against Serbia in Lille, France, where group play will be held. The knockout and medal rounds of the 5\u00d75 Olympic tournament will be played in Paris.\n\nThe U.S. has won four consecutive Olympic gold medals in 5\u00d75 men's basketball and seven of the eight since professionals were first allowed to play in the 1992 Barcelona Games.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

KD and LeBron James will be making their fourth appearance at the Olympics. His three gold medal haul in the games is the most among its current team members.\n\nLooking back at his history playing for the flag in the Olympics, Team USA's all-time leading scorer thinks that the 2024 Dream Team is the deepest team he's played on.\n\n\"It is definitely the deepest team I've played on since I've been with USAB,\" said KD during an interview with Yahoo's Vincent Goodwill. \"From top to bottom, everybody is the guy on their team. \"\n\nThe More star-studded team\n\nDurant was the team captain of the last U.S. Olympic Dream Team. That team lost to France in their 2021 Olympic opener but came on strong and got its revenge over the Frenchmen in the gold medal game. But after last year's U.S. men's basketball team to the FIBA World Cup three times and finished just in fourth place, USAB had to enlist the best team possible for Paris.\n\nAside from Durant, USAB is also returning Devin Booker, Bam Adebayo, Jrue Holiday, and Jayson Tatum for a second straight Olympics. But with guys like LeBron James, Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis, the 2024 U.S. men's basketball team is definitely the more star-studded team than its immediate predecessor.\n\n\"I mean, the last Olympics we had a couple of younger, you know, role players in the league that grinded their way up in camp and got that opportunity, which was cool, but they wasn't like the best players on it. Like these guys are Hall of Famers, all-stars, you know, so I'm excited about this,\" added Durant.\n\nRelated: \"Talk about changing the entire dynamics of your franchise\" - Charles Barkley commends the Warriors and Nuggets for keeping their stars\n\nThe best American players available\n\nThat 2021 team had role players Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee stepping in for Brad Beal and Kevin Love. But even if you had the original members, the 2024 Dream Team still pales in terms of star power and depth.\n\nWhen Durant played for the Rio Olympics in 2016, his team also had players like Deandre Jordan, Draymond Green, and Kyle Lowry, who, while former all-stars, were more role players when they made the team. In 2012, KD also played with guys like Andre Iguodala, Tyson Chandler, and Deron Williams, who, while All-Stars and DPOY that year, weren't really the best players that USAB could send.\n\nHowever, after the close call in 2021 and last year's debacle, USAB isn't taking any chances for the 2024 Paris Olympics. They are sending arguably the best team - at least on paper, possible. It may not be better than the original Dream Team. Still, it's definitely the deepest among the four teams Durant has played for.\n\nRelated: Anthony Edwards on playing alongside LeBron, Steph, KD, and Tatum for Team USA: \"I'm still the number one

While Team USA will be parading a stacked roster led by LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant, they will still face some fierce competition in Paris. For this piece, let's rank the 10 biggest threats to Team USA at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n11. Japan\n\nJapan will be entering the Olympics as the biggest underdogs. While they proved that they were the best-placed Asian team at the 2023 FIBA World Cup, Japan needs to further elevate their performance if they want to make a splash at the Paris Olympics.\n\nFortunately, the addition of Rui Hachimura helps while maintaining the strong core of B. League players along with former NBA vet Yuta Watanabe. However, it will require Japan to pull off upsets for them to advance.\n\n10. Brazil\n\nBrazil punched their ticket to the Olympics after ruling the FIBA OQT in Riga, dominating the host Latvia in the final game. Team USA better keep tabs on Golden State Warrior Gui Santos as well as former NBA players Cristiano Felicio, FIBA OQT Tissot MVP Bruno Caboclo, and the ageless Marcelinho Huertas.\n\nWhile it seems like Brazil doesn't have a lot of depth, this well-seasoned squad makes up for it with physicality and athleticism. However, Team USA may be a tough assignment for them.\n\n9. South Sudan\n\nConsidered to be the hottest team out of FIBA Africa, South Sudan pulled off a major surprise at the 2023 FIBA World Cup by becoming the best-placed African team to punch a ticket to the Paris Olympics.\n\nWith the program spearheaded by NBA veteran Luol Deng and the team coached by former NBA player Royal Ivey, South Sudan will have the potential to pull some surprises. Moreover, they also have a handful of players with NBA experience at their disposal including Wenyen Gabriel, Thon Maker, and naturalized player Carlik Jones.\n\nBut the name that stands out in their roster is the potential arrival of Suns big man Bol Bol. South Sudan will have a lot of length and athleticism that can potentially test Team USA, especially if they catch them on a bad night. Furthermore, look for former NBA players Luol Deng and Royal Ivey to devise a game plan that will allow South Sudan to at least be competitive.\n\n8. Puerto Rico\n\nPuerto Rico had an amazing tournament on their home turf, dramatically punching an Olympic ticket for the first time in 20 years at the FIBA OQT in San Juan, led by the fine play of New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado, who won the FIBA OQT Tissot MVP.\n\nWhile the NBA is used to seeing Alvarado defensively, he's tasked to carry the team's load offensively, which Team USA may not be used to. With Puerto Rico in the same group, Team USA needs to keep their scorers in check, including Alvarado and former NBA player Tremont Waters.\n\nTheir big men Isaiah Romero, Christopher Ortiz and Arnold Toro are also unafraid of getting physical with the best big men in the world.\n\n7. Spain\n\nSpain qualified for the Olympics thanks to a solid stand on their home court in Valencia. What's scarier is they didn't seem like they faced any major resistance with exception to a gallant stand by the Bahamas in the final.\n\nWith the No. 2 team in the world punching an Olympic spot, Team USA should watch out for this European powerhouse, especially if they field naturalized player Lorenzo Brown, national team mainstays Rudy Fernandez and Sergio Llull, NBA veterans the Hernangomez twins, FIBA OQT MVP Santi Aldama, and former Golden State Warrior Usman Garuba.\n\n6. Greece\n\nLike Spain, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Greeks punched their Olympic ticket through the FIBA OQT. They also achieved it on their home floor.\n\nShould they succeed, Team USA should watch out for the Antetokounmpo brothers of Giannis and Kostas. While Thanasis is sidelined indefinitely, with shooters and former NBA big man Georgios Papagiannis surrounding the size and athleticism of the Antetokounmpo brothers, there's plenty to worry about.\n\n5. Australia\n\nAustralia finally secured a medal at the international stage after taking bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. After that, Australia opted to enter into a rebuilding chapter. They struggled at the 2023 FIBA World Cup, parading a depleted and young roster.\n\nHowever, they will be fielding a tougher lineup at the 2024 Paris Olympics, which should concern Team USA. With a mix of grizzled veterans both at the NBA and FIBA level, Australia has never shied away from giving Team USA a run for their money.\n\n4. Canada\n\nCanada will easily be a top contender at the 2024 Paris Olympics, making them a major threat to Team USA's gold-medal hopes. Of course, this was also the same team that prevented Team USA from bringing home a medal in last year's 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nWhile Team USA will enforce a better roster, so will Canada. With already a team that's been proven to win at a world stage, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the team will also get stronger with the addition of NBA champion Jamal Murray.\n\n3. Germany\n\nAnother team that defeated Team USA at the 2023 FIBA World Cup is the world champions themselves. Germany will roughly maintain the same championship roster. With a lineup that's built on quickness and blitz scoring, an aging Team USA should figure out how to slow down the world champions led by Brooklyn Nets guard Dennis Schroder and the Wagner brothers.\n\n2. Serbia\n\nSpeaking of the 2023 FIBA World Cup, Silver medalist Serbia will be keen on not only beating Team USA but to win gold. Although they came close last year, the exciting addition of three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic should easily bolster their chances. Serbia will have a variety of offensive weapons to choose from.\n\nFurthermore, don't forget about their head coach Svetislav \"Kari\" Pe\u0161i\u0107, who led them to silver last year and was the brains behind coaching FR Yugoslavia to a win over Team USA back in the quarterfinals of the 2002 FIBA World Championship. Right from the get-go, Team USA will be tested by Serbia in the Olympic opener.\n\n1. France\n\nThe host team should have plenty to be excited about, which should worry Team USA. France has already tested Team USA in the past few meetings with France winning two of their last three. Team USA of course won the 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold medal at the expense of France in their last outing.\n\nHowever, France will be parading a literally much bigger roster, with the upcoming Olympic debut of the NBA Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama. With France enjoying home-court advantage, Team USA will have to watch out.\n\nOf course, France will make their home fans happy by parading NBA players Nicholas Batum, Evan Fournier, and four-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert, who will form a formidable twin-tower combination with the Spurs rookie.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

It didn't take much time for reports to emerge regarding who would replace the former Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nMarc J. Spears reported for Andscape that Boston Celtics star role player Derrick White would be tabbed to replace Leonard on Team USA. White had a career year for the reigning champs, averaging 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game.\n\nWhite's familiarity with Steve Kerr's Olympic scheme and his teammates were likely the driving factors in the decision. He played on the 2019 FIBA World Cup team, when Kerr was an assistant, and of course just finished a title run with Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday. Now the trio will go for gold together.\n\nWhite's skillset and defending will be paramount to Team USA's gold medal quest this year. He's outstanding locking down opposing guards and plays bigger than his size in the paint. Offensively White is a good passer and connector who is perfectly content to get zero shots up if it means his team wins. Being able to impact the game without dominating the ball is a crucial skill for an American side featuring all-time greats like Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant, all of whom are best with the ball in their hands.\n\nIt's tougher than ever for Team USA to dominate on the world stage. White is now part of the journey to try and earn the country's fifth straight first place Olympic finish.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Derrick White to Replace Kawhi Leonard on Team USA for Paris Olympics, per Report .", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_mckeone@thestate.com", "name": "Liam McKeone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andscape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andscape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/50b1t7/picture289921954/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/dfcbd25a-f69d-4c1c-a04d-1476b8487581", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But his only focus is winning a gold medal after donning the red, white and blue during Team USA practices at UNLV this week.\n\n\"I've known these guys for a long time, so it made it easy to be a part of this special team and this country, which I love and where I'm raising my family and my American son,\" Embiid said Monday. \"It's fun to be around so many great players, but everything is serious. We have a goal to accomplish, so it's all about maximizing the amount of time we have together to get on the same page and try to get better every day.\"\n\nThe decision\n\nEmbiid, 30, declined to say why he picked the United States in October, saying he has addressed the topic already.\n\nHe was previously linked to the Cameroon national team, but he did not play a game for the country during the 2017 FIBA AfroBasket tournament. Cameroon ultimately didn't qualify for the 2024 Olympics in men's basketball after losing to Latvia on Saturday.\n\nFrance was also an option after Embiid was granted French citizenship despite never having lived in the country. He became a U.S. citizen in 2022 as well. There was some thought he would join French standouts Rudy Gobert, Victor Wembanyama and Evan Fournier and challenge Team USA's Olympic dominance.\n\nEmbiid's decision became clear in October. He ultimately wanted to compete for the country where his son Arthur was born.\n\nEmbiid arrived in the U.S. when he was 15-years-old and has stayed since. He played at Kansas for a year and has starred for the Philadelphia 76ers since being drafted third overall in 2014.\n\nHe has often said his son changed everything in his life. Arthur is now a factor in every choice Embiid makes.\n\nHappy to have him\n\nEmbiid's American teammates welcomed him with open arms.\n\n\"Jo is a great friend,\" Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum said Monday. \"We've had so many battles in the regular season and playoffs, but that's the fun part of this. You get to be on the same team as some of these guys you compete and battle and fight against. That's the unique and cool part of Team USA. Guys you usually need to have an extra edge to play against now coming together to try to do something special.\"\n\nEmbiid's next job is finding his role within the team.\n\nHe's a force in the paint and beyond the arc in the NBA, where he's won two of the last three scoring titles. Coach Steve Kerr may ask Embiid to drift out to the 3-point line less with Team USA.\n\n\"He's a great passer out of the post,\" Kerr said. \"Very dominant scorer down there, too. I think the difference for Joel will be that we're going to ask him to be down near the hoop more than he is in the NBA. He spends a lot of time at the foul line area and he's good there and he'll get the ball there for us too, but his physicality and ability to score down low here in the FIBA game is going to be really important for us.\"\n\nThat's fine with Embiid.\n\nHe understands everyone will have a different role on this roster than they do with their NBA team.\n\n\"Nothing changes,\" he said. \"I'll still be dominant like I always am.\"\n\nFeeling good\n\nOne of the few things that has held Embiid back in his career is health.\n\nHe played just 39 games last season because of a left knee procedure.

It appears that neither Curry nor LeBron are able to execute the simple task of spinning a basketball on their finger.\n\nYou know, the little trick you typically learn as a third-grader?\n\n\"I can do a lot of things with a basketball, a lot of things,\" Curry said. \"But that is the one thing that I can not do.\"\n\nIf you haven't seen the video of the Team USA players being asked if they could accomplish the trivial task or not, it's worth a watch. So far, the video has over 2.2 million views on X. Most players are successful, but a surprising few -- Tyrese Haliburton and Joel Embiid along with James and Curry -- are unable.\n\n\"As a little kid, don't you just sit around and practice this all day?\" Jrue Holiday rightfully asks.\n\nThe reactions of others, like Kevin Durant and Bam Adebayo, when they find out that some can't do it is what makes the video so great. Adebayo delivered a perfect response when being told that Haliburton was unable.\n\n\"Gen Z,\" the Miami Heat center said with an eye roll.\n\n\"Joel? That's sickening,\" Durant added. \"I thought he had more coordination than that.\"\n\nIt's not a shock that 100% of the team can't spin a ball on their finger, but the fact that Curry is unable to still remains mindblowing. As a man who is so artfully skilled with the ball, and routinely able to knock down pre-game trick shots and in-game circus shots, it feels like he would have to be able to do this.\n\n\"That is one of the most embarrassing things,\" Curry said. \"You've got me nervous just thinking about it.\"\n\nMaybe his teammates can teach him how while they are together in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nRelated: Anthony Edwards' Comedic Entrance at Team USA Training Camp is Turning Heads", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_neel@postandcourier.com", "name": "Zachary Neel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_Pavilion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haas Pavilion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Golden_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Golden Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/02/002fe992-466f-53a2-b54d-9fbc3dbc4f91/668c03905ed51.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Spears of Andscape. He joins a star-studded squad and will give Team USA another versatile defender and an off-ball threat to balance things out on offense. An incredible teammate in Boston, White should fit right in with the rest of the Team USA roster, both on the court and off.\n\nWhile he's never been an All-Star like everyone else on the team, White is coming off an NBA championship with the Celtics and a season where he averaged a career high 15.2 points off nearly 40 percent shooting from downtown. He was named to the NBA's All-Defensive Second Team for a second straight year, after he averaged 1.2 blocks and 1.0 steals per game during the regular season.\n\nWhite will be joining Boston teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday on the 12-man roster, as the trio of Celtics look to add a gold medal to their trophy collection. We could potentially see White and Holiday play alongside each other in the Olympics, which would give Team USA the same lockdown backcourt as the championship Celtics.\n\nThough he wasn't on the team with Tatum and Holiday when Team USA won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, White does have some experience on the international stage.

So when the 76ers' superstar big man finally slipped on a No. 11 Team USA jersey on Saturday, it represented another step toward his longtime goal that will be accomplished in Paris later this month.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was going to be volleyball or basketball, but [becoming an Olympian] was definitely the dream,\" Embiid told a small group of reporters following Team USA's first practice. \"So I'm just excited to have that chance of realizing that dream.\"\n\nEmbiid, the 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player and two-time scoring leader, is part of an American squad so stacked that it is drawing comparisons to the 1992 Dream Team. LeBron James is playing in his first Olympics since 2012. Stephen Curry and Kawhi Leonard are about to take part in their first Games. And this will be Embiid's first FIBA competition of any kind, following a significant decision on which country to represent.\n\nHe is a citizen of the United States and France, the silver-winning team in Tokyo in 2021 that boasts NBA stars Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama. Or, Embiid could have played for his native Cameroon, which was still in the running for an Olympic bid until losing to Latvia in the Olympic qualifying tournament over the weekend.\n\nEmbiid reiterated Saturday that he picked the U.S. partially because it's where his 3-year-old son, Arthur, was born, and where he has now lived for nearly half his life. Also, France put a deadline on his decision, prompting an October commitment to play for the U.S.\n\n\"Thankfully, he chose us,\" teammate Anthony Davis quipped Saturday.\n\nEmbiid and Davis, plus fellow All-Star Bam Adebayo, will create a formidable frontcourt that, under FIBA's rules, can park in the paint for longer than three seconds. Those players also will aim to rectify Team USA's most glaring flaw in recent international play, when the Americans were pushed around by opposing centers.\n\n\"Everybody knows it's hard to bully me, and it's hard to bully those other guys,\" Embiid said. \"I think we've got enough size and basketball IQ. ... Honestly, I'm just excited to get the ball in the post and having Steph, [Kevin Durant], 'Bron cutting.\"\n\nThat talent overflow was evident following Saturday's practice, when Embiid chatted with Curry (and Utah Jazz coach Will Hardy) while demonstrating moves with the ball in his hands. During Sunday's scrimmage against the Select Team, Embiid shared the floor with Curry, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker, and Kawhi Leonard (and, later, Anthony Edwards). After that practice, Curry took a seat next to Embiid for another conversation while Hardy approached the big man for an emphatic high five.\n\n\"I know he has a lot of questions and thoughts about how to put himself in position to be successful and help the team,\" said Curry, noting his relationship with Embiid stems from their past shoe deals with Under Armour. \"That's been what most of our conversations have been about. ... You can tell we're all just hyped to be here, and he's been all smiles since Day 1.\"\n\nAdded Embiid: \"I'm playing with a lot of great, amazing basketball players. So if I've got to take zero shots and play defense, I'm happy with it. ... I don't see [my teammates] as competition. I just want to enjoy them.\"", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Morning Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gina_mizell@mcall.com", "name": "Gina Mizell", "type": "author",

Expectedly, this team will enter the competition as heavy favorites to retain its Olympic gold medal. Amidst the anticipation over this roster, Rachel Nichols outlined the expectations around them, garnering the fans' attention.\n\nDuring the latest UNDISPUTED episode, she claimed this roster to be at par with the historical national teams. Consequently, the supporters expect this team to win nothing but gold for the USA. Justifying the demands of the fans, Nichols stated,\n\n\"Would be hugely embarrassing [if they lost] because the way this team is being viewed and hyped, it's one of the best Olympics teams the USA has had ever. You're gonna compare them to the Dream Team, to that Redeem Team. Other than that, they are right up there... I still think the USA should absolutely win this tournament... There is a reality that they have better players and therefore the perception is they should win\".\n\nAmidst the high expectations, her words portrayed a near-accurate picture of the circumstances. After all, this roster possesses NBA champions and future Hall of Famers such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis. These players are set to lay a strong foundation for the rest of the team.\n\nOn top of this, experienced stars such as Devin Booker, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Jrue Holiday, and Jayson Tatum provide this team with unfathomable depth. Additionally, young All-Stars such as Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton add much-needed balance to this squad. As a result, on paper, none of the rival nations come close to matching this team's strength.\n\nHowever, basketball is a game that is not played on paper. So, on their day, any other competitor can humiliate this side.

One NBA insider currently covering the practices for this year's team made the case for why it is not a wild idea.\n\nThere really is no better assemblage of active players than 1992's men's Olympic basketball team. For decades, the best amateur players in the nation did an admirable job representing the nation on the world stage. However, the team that gathered in Barcelona over two decades ago featured the very best players the NBA had to offer at the time.\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 moments in USA Olympic Basketball history, including the 1992 Dream Team\n\nIt just so happens that the '92 team included quite a few of the greatest players of all time. The legendary \"Dream Team\" featured Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and a cornucopia of other Hall-of-Famers.\n\nYet not only were they a team-up of some of the best basketball players ever, they completely dominated the field that year. Ever since, every team after has been compared to the \"Dream Team.\" The only group that many believe was as good is the group known as the \"Redeem Team\" which featured future Hall-of-Famers like Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, and Dwayne Wade.\n\nHowever, at least one NBA insider believes the 2024 edition of the men's USA Basketball team has the potential to be just as strong as the \"Dream Team.\"\n\n\"There's been inevitable comparisons to the 1992 \"Dream Team\" and that happens during every Olympics, but I think that can actually be a valid case here,\" veteran NBA reporter Mark Medina told Sportsnaut this week. \"You have the NBA's all-time leading scorer Lebron James. You have the NBA's best shooter ever, Stephen Curry. You have one of the most efficient scorers ever in Kevin Durant. When you look at the talent, they have a very interesting blend of experienced players and young and up-and-coming players.\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 USA Olympics track victories ever, including Jesse Owens and Wilma Rudolph\n\n\"... Durant is really the only player who has been there and done that in consecutive Olympic games since 2012. Obviously, this isn't Lebron James' first rodeo, but he hasn't played since 2012 ... Curry hasn't played in the Olympics until now. Didn't even make the team in 2012 -- that's ridiculous. Then when you look at the rest of the group, there's just a lot of good, prime, and young up-and-coming talent. Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton. It's weird to say Jayson Tatum's young but he's in his prime and already won a gold medal in Tokyo.\"\n\nIt's a fair case and this year's team is stacked.

'That is the one thing I can't do.'\n\nPopularized by the Harlem Globetrotters and mastered by everyone from Dr. J to middle school gym teachers, the trick requires the performer to balance a ball on an index finger while using the other hand to spin the sphere with enough centripetal force for it to remain in place.\n\nThe hardest part is getting started. Both hands are needed to send the ball into a rapid rotation before shifting one underneath to support the weight of the spinning orb. Some experts recommend getting the ball on top of a fingernail in order to reduce friction.\n\n'That's one of the most embarrassing things,' Curry continued as he tried and failed to accomplish the feat for the cameras. 'You got me nervous even thinking about spinning a ball on my finger.'\n\nThe game's most prolific 3-pointer shooter has one embarrassing flaw on the court\n\nMalika Andrews (L) talks with Stephen Curry as he leaves a news conference after a practice\n\nCurry's embarrassment is understandable.\n\nWhen one spends as much time on a basketball court as he has, an ability to do these sorts of tricks is expected. Clearly has no such issues with shooting or dribbling - two areas of the game where he's considered a master.\n\nBut fortunately for the Golden State Warriors star, he's not the only member of Team USA who can't perform the trick.\n\n'I'll try - ain't really my thing' said LeBron James, who also struggled to pull of the maneuver.\n\nRead More Two NBA stars BRAWL during heated international match between France and Germany\n\nCoincidentally (or not), James was born in the same Akron, Ohio hospital as Curry, whose father was playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers at the time of his birth. So, perhaps, there is something in the water Akron General Medical Center.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid wasn't born in Akron, but rather Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, not that it makes any difference. Like Curry and James, the naturalized American citizen is also incapable of spinning a ball of his finger.\n\n'I'm probably the only guy on the team that cannot,' Embiid said, unaware that Curry and James also failed.\n\nPhoenix Suns star Kevin Durant didn't hesitate to express his disappointment in Embiid.\n\n'That's sickening,' Durant said. 'I thought he had more coordination than that.'\n\nAnthony Davis had no problem spinning a basketball on his finger, proving Jrue Holiday wrong\n\nDurant was also surprised to learn that Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Halliburton struggled in this area as well.\n\n'At the point guard [and he] don't know how to do that?' Durant asked.\n\nBoston Celtics point guard and two-time NBA champion Jrue Holiday had no problem, although he misfired when he predicted that LA Lakers star and Team USA center Anthony Davis would be unable to duplicate the skill.\n\n'C'mon Jrue, you know me better than that,' Davis said while effortless spinning the ball on his finger.\n\nTeam USA's stars would have a hard time competing with former Pacers, Magic, Lakers and Suns coach Frank Vogel.\n\nNow 51, Vogel was an eight grader growing up in New Jersey when he made an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. Remarkably, Vogel was able to spin a basketball on the end of an elongated toothbrush while simultaneously cleaning his teeth.\n\nTeam USA has a warmup vs. Team Canada on July 10 in Las Vegas before exhibitions in Abu Dhabi and London later this month.\n\nThe US will defend its Olympic gold medal beginning on July 28 against Serbia.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Globetrotters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harlem Globetrotters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.B._King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B.B.

Rhode Island women's basketball head coach Tammi Reiss was named Assistant Coach under Rizzotti.\n\n\"Two accomplished coaches will lead our 3\u00d73 efforts in Paris,\" said Jim Tooley, USA Basketball CEO. \"We are grateful to Jen and Joe for their ongoing commitments to USA Basketball and proud to have the opportunity for both 3\u00d73 teams to compete at the Olympic Games.\"\n\nRizzotti, a longtime member of the USA Basketball family, will be at the helm for the defending Olympic gold medalist women. Last year, Rizzotti coached three gold-medal-winning teams, including the 2023 USA 3\u00d73 Women's World Cup Team, 2023 USA 3\u00d73 Women's AmeriCup Team and 2023 USA 3\u00d73 Women's Pan American Team. She made her 3\u00d73 coaching debut in 2022 on the FIBA 3\u00d73 Women's Series.\n\nRizzotti, who has USA Basketball 5-on-5 and 3\u00d73 coaching experience, won gold as an assistant coach to Dawn Staley at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She currently chairs the USA Basketball Women's National Team Committee (5-on-5), which will select the 2024 USA Women's National Team.\n\n\"I am absolutely honored to be continuing my USA Basketball journey as the head coach of the 2024 USA 3\u00d73 Women's National Team,\" Rizzotti said. \"It has been the joy of my career to coach athletes who are representing our country on the biggest stage at the Olympic Games. This sport is exhilarating to watch, challenging to coach and extremely rewarding to be a part of. I am grateful for all the people who were instrumental in helping us qualify for Paris and I look forward to preparing the athletes for one of those most competitive environments I will ever be a part of.\"\n\nJoining Rizzotti as assistant coach is Tammi Reiss (University of Rhode Island). An assistant under Rizzotti at the FIBA 3\u00d73 World Cup, Reiss has additional 3\u00d73 coaching experience as the head coach for the 2023 USA U24 Team on the FIBA Women's Series and at the 2023 USA 3\u00d73 Nations League Final.\n\n\"Tammi is the perfect complement to me,\" Rizzotti said. \"I am thrilled to have her by my side. She is passionate, detail oriented, focused and fun to be around. She is also one of the few coaches who understands 3\u00d73 like I do and I know she will work tirelessly to make sure that we are ready for the competition.\"\n\nLewandowski, who has been coaching and advising the USA Basketball 3\u00d73 program since 2014, will lead a team of men making their 3\u00d73 Olympic debuts. With over a dozen USA Basketball coaching assignments, Lewandowski most recently led the 2023 USA 3\u00d73 Men's Pan American Team to the gold medal and the 2023 USA 3\u00d73 Men's World Cup Team to silver.\n\nLewandowski has been a coaching fixture at nearly every level and is currently the head coach at Butler County Community College in Oak Hills, Pennsylvania. A standout player, Lewandowski's collegiate career began at Butler County, where he was named a National Junior College Athletic Association All-American before transferring to Slippery Rock University.\n\n\"There is no greater honor than representing your country and wearing USA across your chest at the Olympic Games,\" Lewandowski said. \"This is incredibly humbling. I am beyond blessed and thankful for the opportunity to represent USA Basketball in Paris this summer.\"\n\nAdditionally, James Fraschilla (Capital City Go-Go) will serve as assistant coach for the men's squad. Fraschilla previously assisted USA Basketball's Team Washington DC and Team Omaha on the 2023 FIBA 3\u00d73 Men's World Tour.\n\n\"It is very exciting to work with James as we prepare our athletes for Paris,\" Lewandowski said. \"He is a tireless worker on the journey to pursue USA Basketball's first 3\u00d73 men's Olympic gold medal. We are looking forward to the challenge.\"\n\nFIBA previously announced that USA Basketball automatically qualified men's and women's 3\u00d73 teams for the 2024 Olympics. In each category, the United States was one of three countries that qualified based on FIBA 3\u00d73 world rankings as of Oct. 31, 2023, and will bypass the 2024 Olympic Qualifying Tournaments. For more information about Olympic qualification, click here.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics are set for July 26-Aug. 11, with the 3\u00d73 basketball competition set for July 30-Aug.5 at Place de la Concorde. More information, including 2024 USA 3\u00d73 National Team training camp details and complete competition schedule, will be announced at a later date.\n\nDifferent than 5-on-5, 3\u00d73 is played on a half-court with a 10-minute game clock and 12-second shot clock. Play is continuous, as teams \"clear\" the ball behind the 2-point line following a made basket, defensive rebound or steal. The first team to score 21 points via 1-point field goals or 2-pointers behind the arc is victorious; or if time expires then the team leading wins.", "source": {"uri": "abc6.com", "dataType": "news",

The athletes hail from coast to coast, and from San Diego to the Bay Area and beyond, many of them have ties to the Golden State - whether they grew up here or currently play for a California team.\n\nOf course, California is an athletic powerhouse and some of the best athletes in every sport have California here. But here, we're going to focus on hoops.\n\nThe 12-member men's team players were selected by the USA Men's Basketball Team managing director, Grant Hill. As one of the most respected names in the sport, Hill is an Olympic gold medalist and spent 19 years playing in the NBA. The 2024 roster is bursting at the seams with skill, technique and athleticism, showcasing a combination of battle-tested veterans and the young and hungry future faces of the league.\n\nBelow is the full roster for the 2024 USA Basketball Men's 5 x 5 Olympic Team:\n\nIn addition, the men's national basketball team coaching staff is equally impressive as the roster. Two of the coaches for Team USA also have California ties. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr serves as the head coach of the program and LA Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue is one of the assistant coaches, along with Erik Spoelstra (Miami Heat) and Mark Few (Gonzaga University).\n\nCalifornia connection:\n\nStephen Curry has roots all across the U.S. He was born in Akron, Ohio, like fellow NBA legend, LeBron James. He grew up in North Carolina, where he elevated his game at Davidson College. After three seasons, he was selected by the Golden State Warriors as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. Since then, as one of the faces of the league, he has fully embraced life in the Bay Area on and off the court. Curry is a four-time NBA champion and ten-time NBA All-Star.\n\nCalifornia connection:\n\nNBA superstar Anthony Davis has been playing for the Los Angeles Lakers since 2019. He's one-half of one of the best duos in the league with LeBron James. The Chicago native attended the University of Kentucky and was then selected first overall in the 2012 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Pelicans where he quickly became one of the best big men in the game. The nine-time All-Star, who won All-Star MVP in 2017, has previously won two other gold medals - the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2012 Olympic Games. Davis is also the eighth player in history to have won an NBA title, an NCAA championship, and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nCalifornia ties:\n\nJrue Holiday is coming to Paris after winning his second NBA championship. He won his first NBA title in 2021 with the Milwaukee Bucks and earned his second with the Boston Celtics last month. He is one of the three Holiday brothers, and his siblings Justin and Aaron also play in the NBA. The Holidays were born and raised in Southern California and attended Campbell Hall in Studio City. Jrue Holiday went to UCLA for a year before he was declared for the NBA Draft. In 2009, he was selected 17th overall by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nCalifornia connection:\n\nAs the oldest active player in the NBA and on the Olympic roster, LeBron James continues to be a force on the court. James, along with Kevin Durant, will suit up for Team USA for the fourth time.\n\nWhile his roots are in Ohio, the NBA legend has been a Los Angeles Laker since 2019 and recently, he signed a two-year deal. Next season, he will begin his 22nd season in the league and has an extensive list of accolades to show for it. The four-time NBA champion and 20-time NBA All-Star won his first gold medal in 2001 at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival. He won three others at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, as well as the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games. As his time in the league nears its end, this will be his final Olympic run.\n\nCalifornia ties:\n\nKawhi Leonard is a two-time NBA Finals MVP who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers. He was born in Los Angeles before he moved to the Inland Empire. As a teenager, he became a standout at Martin Luther King High School in Moreno Valley. Leonard played for two seasons at San Diego State University before declaring for the 2011 NBA Draft, in which he was selected as the 15th overall pick. He won championships with the San Antonio Spurs and the Toronto Raptors and has since brought his talents back to his hometown.\n\nCalifornia ties:\n\nKareem Maddox's Olympic profile describes him as \"one of the most decorated American athletes in the discipline\" in reference to the 3x3 game. While he may not be as commonly known as his fellow Team USA athletes, his resume proves he shines in the worldwide stage. He was born in Los Angeles and attended Oak Park High School and attended Princeton University for four seasons. He won gold medals at the 2023 Pan American Games, 2022 FIBA AmeriaCup, the 2021 FIBA AmeriCup, the 2019 Pan American Games and the 2019 FIBA World Cup - all on 3x3 teams.\n\nThe WNBA is exploding in popularity. The USA women's basketball team athletes were selected by the USA Women's National Team Committee and approved by the USA Basketball Board of Directors.\n\nFans will be able to see the star-studded Olympic team take on the WNBA All-Stars during the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game in Phoenix on Saturday, July 20.\n\nChelsea Gray was born in Manteca, a mid-sized city located between Stockton and Modesto. Data from Team USA indicates she is 25-3 in a USA Basketball uniform and she has previously won gold medals at the 2020 Olympics and the 2022 FIBA World Cup. Gray has won three WNBA championships - two with her current team, the Las Vegas Aces, in which she won WNBA Finals MVP in 2022, and her first with the LA Sparks in 2016. Before going pro, she played four seasons at Duke University where she became the first player in the program to record two triple-doubles.\n\nCalifornia ties:\n\nKelsey Plum is another player for the Las Vegas Aces with California roots. Plum was born in Poway and attended La Jolla Country Day before she spent her college year at the University of Washington. She was the first overall pick in the 2017 WNBA Draft and was selected by the San Antonio Stars before they relocated to Sin City. It's no surprise she has four gold medals under her belt - the 2013 FIBA U19 World Cup, the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the 2020 Olympic Games 3x3, and the 2022 FIBA World Cup.\n\nCalifornia ties:\n\nSabrina Ionescu is one of the most recognizable faces in the game. You've probably seen her highlights on social media or seen her face in a commercial, and the 26-year-old's game is worth the hype. She was born in Walnut Creek and attended Miramonte High School in Orinda (Contra Costa County). Her popularity exploded during her four seasons at Oregon and in 2020, she was the first overall pick in the WNBA Draft. Like several of her Olympic teammates, her accolades include numerous gold medals, which she earned at the 2022 FIBA World Cup, the 2019 Pan American Games (3x3), the 2014 FIBA U17 World Cup, and the 2013 FIBA Americas U16 Championship.\n\nCalifornia ties:\n\nIf there was a Mt. Rushmore of the WNBA, Diana Taurasi would certainly be on it. Taurasi was born and raised in Chino and attended Don Antonio Lugo High School. She began gaining national attention while at the University of Connecticut, where she won three consecutive NCAA championships. At 42 years old, the 3-time WNBA champion isn't slowing down anytime soon. The Phoenix Mercury superstar is no stranger to the Olympic Games and holds the record for most Olympic titles in US basketball history - having won gold medals at Athens 2004, Beijing 2008, London 2012, Rio 2016, and Tokyo 2020.\n\nCalifornia connection:\n\nDearica Hamby is having a stellar season with the LA Sparks. She was selected to the 3x3 team in late June after her teammate, Cameron Brink, suffered an injury earlier this season. The spot is rightfully hers as she's been a dominant force on the court. She previously won a gold medal at the 2023 FIBA 3x3 AmeriCup. She was also on the 2023 USA Women's National Team and the 2022 USA Women's World Cup Qualifying Team.\n\nYou can get a first look at the 5x5 teams very soon. The men's team plays an exhibition game against Team Canada on Wednesday, July 10 in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the women's team will take on the WNBA All-Stars at the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game in Phoenix on Saturday, July 20.", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los

LeBron or Curry off the bench?", "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Don't read too much into who is starting for Team USA when it takes the court Wednesday night against Canada.\n\n\"We are purposely going to just throw all kinds of different combinations out there...\" USA head coach Steve Kerr said. \"I imagine I'll change the starting lineup for the first few games, just try different ones. Everybody understands this is a very unique situation. They're all not only starters, but superstars, future Hall of Famers. So they all deserve to start but only five can. We will figure it out.\"\n\nKerr has options, but if we don't see the Paris starting five against Canada -- and we definitely won't with Kevin Durant out -- then who will start in Paris? Let's break it down.\n\nSteve Kerr learned a hard lesson at the World Championships in the Philippines last summer -- his small-ball lineups don't work the same way in the physical game allowed internationally as they do in the NBA. The USA struggled to match up with size.\n\nEnter Joel Embiid -- the most dominant physical big man in the NBA (or, at least tied with Nikola Jokic). If Team USA takes home another gold it will be because Embiid -- along with some help off the bench from Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo (who Kerr seemed to use together in scrimmages, bumping Bam to the four) -- could match up physically inside with anyone. Kerr added this style of play may be an adjustment for Embiid because he'll be down on the block more.\n\n\"Nothing changes,\" Embiid responded. \"I'll still be dominant as I always am. I'll just see a few more touches in the low post and go from there.\"\n\nThere is a political element to being USA basketball coach and with this team in particular -- Kerr has to start these three legends. Even on a team of superstars, these three icons can't come off the bench.\n\nThis is also not a bad thing. The plan in scrimmages appears to have been LeBron as a point-forward initiating the offense, with his elite decision-making and passing setting everyone up, then have Curry working more off the ball and as the secondary shot-creator. (Still, the USA Select team was quick to double Curry once he got the ball and started making a move.) Durant will fit into that nicely once he returns from his calf soreness.\n\nHowever, don't be shocked if Kerr ultimately asks one of these guys to be the sixth man as he works through his thought process because some other lineup combo just works better. It would be weird to see Curry or LeBron coming off the bench, but it's not out of the question.\n\nThis final spot could go a lot of directions, but whoever it is has to take on the 2008 Olympics Kobe Bryant's \"just tell me who to stop\" defensive mindset.\n\nI'll take Leonard. He's still one of the best on-ball defenders in the league, physical (which will play well in FIBA ball), long, and just knows how to play the game. Tell him to just shut someone down, and they'll be toast.\n\n\"It's fun coaching Kawhi, just seeing him up close,\" Kerr said. \"Just the physicality, the strength, the skill. And it's great to see him back on the court.\"\n\nIf not Leonard, Kerr could go a number of directions here: Jayson Tatum or Anthony Edwards can step into this role, or if the USA needs to go bigger against an opponent Anthony Davis can start. If Kerr wants to go smaller, there is Jrue Holiday or maybe Devin Booker.\n\nAll that versatility gets to the key point with Team USA: What matters is not who starts games but who finishes close ones. Kerr will have options when that happens, he can play through his roster in these games and then ride a hot hand at the end -- maybe it's\n\nBooker's night or Holiday's night or Tyrese Haliburton's night. Kerr can just go with it.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type":

Notably, both Anthony Davis and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers are a part of the team.\n\nWhen it comes to different iterations of Team USA, there are plenty of egos to manage and that is something head coach Steve Kerr has to deal with this time around as well. But by having a training camp in Las Vegas, it allows for players to mesh with one another and start building up chemistry.\n\nWhile there is an adjustment period for players, who are regularly the first or second option of their respective teams, most stars already have positive relationships with one another. After spending a couple of days together at camp, Davis revealed that he believes L.A. Clippers star Kawhi Leonard is the funniest player on the team, via Tim Reynolds of AP News:\n\nThis could be surprising to some due to Leonard's calm and neutral demeanor. He is a player that does not have social media and therefore no one knows what he is doing on a day-to-day basis. For someone to even catch the Clippers star with a smile on his face is a rare occurrence.\n\nHowever, it looks like he enjoys being around other stars, which is allowing him to open up and show a different side that those covering the NBA are not familiar with. There is certainly pressure stacking up on Team USA to perform and win the gold medal after coming up short in the FIBA World Cup, but if they can joke around and have fun then that will help alleviate some of that.\n\nAs noted, chemistry is important when it comes to these situations and humor can help relieve some of that pressure as they prepare for Paris. All in all, this is a great sign for Team USA as they are already enjoying the presence of one another and hopefully that continues to be the case throughout the Olympics.\n\nA lot has time passed since Anthony Davis last participated in the Olympics for Team USA as he was just 19 years of age when he was on the squad in 2012.. Now, he is 31-years-old and is frankly a completely different player than he was back then.\n\nAnd this time around, Davis is likely going to be an integral part of potentially winning a gold medal this summer and he discussed what that will look like compared to 2012 when he warmed the bench.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_valento@lakersnation.com", "name": "Matthew Valento", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anthony-Davis-Kawhi-Leonard.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

But before that begins the Olympics are going to be action and three Boston Celtics are involved to help Team USA claim another gold medal yet again. If they were to do that then that would be five straight dating back to 2008 in Beijing.\n\nThis year's team features Steph Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant but then you have Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum, and Payton Pritchard representing the green team in France.\n\nYou're probably thinking, \"Pritchard? I thought he wasn't on the team.\" Yes, you're right he's not but he is a part of the USA Basketball Men's Select Team. If you are unsure of what this team consists then here's a quick explanation.\n\n\"The USA Select Team features a roster of 12 current NBA or NBA G League players; two players with NBA, NBA G League, international, and USA Basketball experience; and one incoming college freshman with USA Basketball experience.\" (h/t USA Basketball).\n\nPritchard was most notable for his clutch buzzer-beater heave during Game 5 of the NBA Finals that sent the entire TD Garden into chaos.\n\nIt may not be the entire Celtics roster that's playing in the Olympics or is on the USA select team but for key guys like Tatum (superstar), Holiday (glue-guy), and Pritchard (sixth-man) this only elevates them much more. The results will surely be reaped and become infectious (in a positive manner) within the locker room and on the court next season.\n\nThere's so much good that will come out of this opportunity as they'll be able to share their experiences, basketball strategies and ultimately bring the roster closer than they already are (crazy to think about considering what has happened.)\n\nThis needs to be looked at delightfully, it will serve Joe Mazzulla and his team well. Improvement is bound to happen and will continue to give them greater odds of winning the NBA championship once more.\n\nBanner No. 19 looks like more of a real possibility as the clock continues to wind.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3373,h_1897,x_0,y_37/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01j2bwz7jq3rfx8nyj02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

We have a goal to accomplish, so it's all about maximizing the amount of time we have together to get on the same page and try to get better every day.\"\n\nThe decision\n\nEmbiid, 30, declined to say why he picked the United States in October, saying he has addressed the topic already.\n\nHe was previously linked to the Cameroon national team, but he did not play a game for the country during the 2017 FIBA AfroBasket tournament. Cameroon ultimately didn't qualify for the 2024 Olympics in men's basketball after losing to Latvia on Saturday.\n\nFrance was also an option after Embiid was granted French citizenship despite never having lived in the country. He became a U.S. citizen in 2022 as well. There was some thought he would join French standouts Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama and challenge Team USA's Olympic dominance.\n\nEmbiid's decision became clear in October.

With that in mind, there's the need to address the twin elephants in the Team USA room: Kawhi Leonard and Joel Embiid.\n\nAs the American men wrapped a four-day camp here Tuesday, the most significant goal was reached -- Embiid and especially Kawhi, who couldn't finish yet another NBA season because of injury, showed no physical issues or concerns.\n\nThis was a matter of high importance, not only for Team USA but obviously the Sixers and Clippers, given the fragility of those two players. In fact, Team USA officials privately expressed concern last month whether Kawhi, specifically, might be an injury scratch altogether or ask for restrictions.\n\nAs for any restrictions: That was non-negotiable for either player, according to those team officials. It was either all-in, or the search for replacement(s) would hastily begin.\n\nThe good news as Team USA prepares for Wednesday's exhibition with Canada is there's no news. Both have been full participants in practices and scrimmages (unlike Kevin Durant, out with a mild calf strain). Neither the players, or their teams, have asked coach Steve Kerr to be placed on a minutes leash.\n\nAnyway, the players themselves badly wanted to be here; this is the first Olympic experience for Kawhi and Embiid, both highly decorated franchise players in search of expanding their own legacies.\n\nEmbiid: \"I've dreamed of this moment, being part of the Olympics, ever since I was a kid, watching it growing up.\"\n\nKawhi: \"I always wanted to be with other talented players, to learn from them, win with them. Been my dream.\"\n\nKawhi was thrilled and honored when chosen for 2024 -- injuries prevented him from previous Team USA selections -- and his 33-year-old body initially cooperated once he accepted the invite last spring. He played 68 games last season, most since 2016-17, and averaged 34 minutes. The Clippers, who wanted to place a heavier emphasis on the regular season compared to years past, were mainly hands-off; he even played back-to-backs.\n\nHowever, two games into the postseason, he was done, plagued by swelling in his repaired right knee. It was the fourth straight postseason he ended by pulling up lame.\n\nSo he has a history, then. And tacking on a month of summer practices and games seemingly would be problematic for someone with that history.\n\nBut Kawhi said, with some caution, he is refreshed and as rejuvenated as he can be:\n\n\"I'm ready to go. Everything's been good so far. I'm playing now so I'm happy. Hopefully it stays that way.\"\n\nHe did admit to a skittish summer process where everything had to go right physically, though, and there was no guarantee of his Team USA presence. He underwent daily treatment (though no surgery) leading up to camp. He responded \"yeah\" when asked if he had initial doubts about playing in the Games following his latest injury.\n\n\"But I took the time,\" he said. \"I was able to turn around over the last two weeks.\"\n\nKawhi seems at peace, to a degree, about his body and the constant struggles with injuries and rehabbing from them.\n\n\"I can't lay out the perfect script for me,\" he said. \"Last year I tried to play as much as possible and felt great, and then after a certain period of time I couldn't go. I don't want to be in the situation where I (find myself) in but I have to take it for what it is.\n\n\"I motivate a lot of people (with injuries) so I got to keep doing what I'm doing. I might be the most known for injuries, so just for me to be able to keep going is going to motivate the next guy. So I'll keep going until I can't. Just going to keep it steady.\"\n\nThere were no ultimatums given by the Clippers regarding his status for Team USA; on the contrary, actually.\n\n\"Everything felt good for him on the lead-up (to USA camp),\" said Ty Lue, an assistant coach on Team USA and also Clippers coach. \"He's moving good right now so I'm just happy that he's feeling pretty good. Hopefully he'll keep moving along and feel 100% when the season starts.\"\n\nEmbiid's injury history isn't as deep but costly and significant as well. Last season he played just 39 games because of knee issues, ruining what shaped up as a historic effort -- he averaged more points (34.7) than minutes played during that stretch yet was ineligible for postseason awards.\n\nIn the playoffs, the former Kia MVP labored, a big man placing pressure on that knee and doing it in the intensity of the postseason. Nonetheless, he was tremendous against the Knicks -- he had a 50-point performance in that first-round series -- while playing 41 minutes a night.\n\nTherefore, like it did with Kawhi, the possibility of bypassing the Olympics in favor of preservation was raised by Embiid -- for about a minute.\n\n\"It came up,\" he said, \"but I never worry about injuries because the moment I do I feel I'm not going to be the same. I think if something happens then it was meant to happen, so I just go with the flow.\n\n\"For me, being part of the Olympics was always the goal. It was an opportunity and a chance I couldn't pass up. And I don't think there is a big risk.\"\n\nThis is important for the American men, because size was a big issue last year during the World Cup; only Bam Adebayo offered much in the middle in terms of proven talent. Embiid said he's out to change that in Paris.\n\n\"As everybody knows it's hard to bully me,\" he said. \"We got enough size. And we got the shooters and talent everywhere. I'll be excited to get the ball in the post, because when I usually play I see double teams every time I touch the ball. So it'll be fun to see single coverage.\"", "source": {"uri": "nba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

The only returning players from that team are Tyrese Haliburton and Anthony Edwards. Added for the Olympic tournament are some guys you might have heard of -- LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant (though he'll miss the game Wednesday night with a calf strain), Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, and Jrue Holiday, just to name a few.\n\nAlso, Joel Embiid will be making his Team USA debut. The 2022-23 NBA MVP was raised in Cameroon, but was made eligible to play for the Americans in time for the Olympics.\n\nSo, yeah. While Canada has added some key reinforcements as well -- Jamal Murray, Andrew Nembhard and likely Trey Lyles -- it's not quite the same, though Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nembhard are as a good a guard rotation as any team in the tournament, Team USA included.\n\nBut for all the feel-good moments the Canadians generated with their run at the World Cup last summer, opening their exhibition schedule against the defending Olympic gold medallist brings home the challenge ahead of them.\n\nIt's not the be-all and end-all, given it's just the first exhibition game for each team. Sure it's being shown live in both countries and the arena will be filled, but it doesn't really count.\n\n\"I mean it's a cool experience because of the stage, right?\" said Canadian head coach Jordi Fernandez after his team's practice Tuesday evening. \"And a lot of people are excited to watch the game. But we have a plan to be the team that is pretty physical and runs a lot, and our conditioning is important. As you guys can tell, our guys work really hard. And (Wednesday's) game is just a part of our plan -- I think we have 17 days to get to that day in the best shape (with) our lives connected and ready to fight.\n\n\"... We're gonna try to win every single game, but I'm telling you, I'm not gonna run any of my players to the ground because ... we have a plan and we have to follow it and you know, the emotions ... it would not make sense to play somebody 30 minutes.\"\n\nBut it's still a special moment. In some ways Canada's journey to being a medal favourite in France began this time of year in Las Vegas two summers ago when men's team general manager Rowan Barrett and then-head coach Nick Nurse asked for a core of players to commit to preparing each summer for World Cup qualifying, the World Cup and, eventually, the Olympics.\n\nWhen Gilgeous-Alexander was the first to step up and declare he wanted to be part of it, a new chapter in Canadian basketball began to be written.\n\nA preview of what could easily be a gold-medal final is a great way to start the slow build to what could be a spectacular payoff.\n\nBut then again, it's just an exhibition game.\n\n\"I think no matter who we play, it's gonna be very exciting just because we know the opportunity that's coming up,\" said Gilgeous-Alexander, who had a World Cup All-Star nod sandwiched between consecutive first-team all-NBA honours. \"We all love basketball, and we all love the bright lights, the stage, so I think regardless of who it is, we're going to be very excited, we're going to be jittery. I might dribble it off my foot the first play, but once the ball goes up and down once or twice, it's basketball and we're doing what we love.\"\n\nHow they do it will be crucial. If Canada has a weakness, it's their relative lack of size across their front line. Among Team USA's many strengths is that they have three world-class centres in Embiid, Davis and Bam Adebayo. Any of them pose a problem for Canada, collectively they represent a nightmare.\n\nWe should get a feel for how Canada plans to manage teams that can play with multiple bigs -- France poses a similar challenge with Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert, who are seven-foot-four and seven-foot-two, respectively.\n\n\"It's a good challenge for us,\" said Fernandez. \"We're gonna run a lot. That's how we're gonna handle it. And, you know, we're young, we've trained very well, and we're ready to play. They have one of the best centers in the world (Embiid), well, two of them (Embiid and Anthony Davis) ... they are very, very good players. (We have) a lot of respect for the team and the program. They're No. 1 in the world, and we got to do this work. So one day in the future, we're in that No. 1 spot, so we're excited to play them and face all that adversity with the size.\"\n\nWhile Canada's bigs -- Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell and potentially two of Lyles and Khem Birch -- don't necessarily match up with a front line like Team USA can put on the floor, guarding them won't be a one-on-one effort.\n\nCanada's got some excellent defenders among their wing contingent -- Gilgeous-Alexander led the NBA is steals, while Lu Dort, Dillon Brooks, Nembhard and Nickeil Alexander-Walker are all considered strong to elite NBA defenders. They can cause problems with their help, can make it difficult for teams to properly get the ball to their bigs and can speed the game up to take them out of their comfort zone.\n\n\"Be disruptive, (be in) passing lanes, ball pressure, make it tough to enter the ball,\" said Gilgeous-Alexander. \"And then we do have really physical bigs despite them not being seven feet. They're physical, they've played a lot of basketball, they've matched up against all kinds of players. We've also confident in their ability to man-up and guard the basketball down low, too.\"\n\nIt's a tall order against one of the biggest and best teams in international basketball, but that's exactly what this edition of the Canadian men's team signed up for when they committed to their Olympic journey.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnet"}, "authors":

Last summer's World Cup team struggled with size and physicality, leading to significant losses. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embiid are now poised to change that narrative, as reported by Joe Vardon of The Athletic.\n\nAnthony Davis highlighting the importance of addressing the team's weaknesses said:\n\n\"They feel like we got bullied last year.\"\n\nDavis, with his 7-6 wingspan and recent first-team All-Defense honor, is a crucial addition to bolster the team's interior presence. He emphasized the need to stop the bullying and set a new tone for Team USA. Davis finished the season averaging 24.6 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game.\n\nJoel Embiid, the former MVP, exuding confidence said:\n\n\"Probably everybody knows it's hard to bully me.\"\n\nEmbiid, standing at 7 feet and weighing about 280 pounds, brings immense scoring and defensive abilities. His career-high 34.7 points per game last season for the Philadelphia 76ers, along with 11.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks, underscores his dominant presence on the court.\n\nBam Adebayo, although the shortest of the trio at 6-9, has proven his mettle as Team USA's starting center during the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"I feel like we will definitely set the tone early, no matter who is in the game.\"\n\nAdebayo, coming off a first-team All-Defense season, echoed the sentiment of toughness and resilience. He emphasized the importance of establishing dominance from the start.\n\nThe addition of these three defensive stalwarts aims to counteract the weaknesses exposed in the previous World Cup, where the U.S. was often outmuscled in the paint. Their presence is expected to transform Team USA's approach, focusing on physicality, rebounding, and interior defense.\n\nWith the first exhibition game against Canada approaching, the team is set to demonstrate their newfound strength. The trio of Davis, Embiid, and Adebayo, along with contributions from LeBron James and Kevin Durant, aim to redefine Team USA's identity, making them formidable contenders for the gold medal in Paris.\n\nAs Bam Adebayo aptly put it, \"You put a team like this together, and we play the right way, it's going to be hard to beat us.\"\n\nFrance Is The Only Team Which Can Match Up To Team USA\n\nFrance, with their towering defensive duo of Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, stands as the only team that can truly challenge Team USA at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Gobert, standing at 7-1, and the 7-5 rookie sensation Wembanyama, have both showcased their defensive prowess by finishing as the winner and runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award this season.\n\nThe combination of Gobert and Wembanyama creates a formidable presence in the paint, capable of disrupting even the most potent offenses. Gobert's shot-blocking and rebounding abilities are well-documented, having anchored the Utah Jazz's defense for years and now with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nHis experience and positioning make him a vital piece for France's defensive scheme. On the other hand, Wembanyama's unique blend of height, agility, and shot-blocking instinct adds a new dimension to the French defense. His ability to alter shots and protect the rim makes him a significant threat to any team attempting to score inside.\n\nOne of the critical advantages for France is the absence of the NBA's three-second rule in international play, allowing their big men to camp in the paint and deter any drives to the basket. This rule difference plays perfectly into the hands of France's defensive strategy, making it difficult for opponents to penetrate and score easy baskets.\n\nTeam USA, with its array of superstar talent, including LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry, will need to be at their absolute best to overcome this defensive juggernaut.\n\nThe presence of Gobert and Wembanyama means that the Americans will have to rely heavily on their perimeter shooting and ball movement to find open shots. Penetrating the French defense will be a significant challenge, and Team USA's guards and wings will need to be precise and efficient in their execution.\n\nThe perimeter players for France, including seasoned veterans and rising stars, are also crucial in supporting their defensive anchors. Players like Evan Fournier and Nicolas Batum bring experience and versatility, capable of both scoring and defending at a high level. Their ability to stretch the floor and create opportunities will be vital for France's overall performance.\n\nFrance's combination of elite defense, anchored by Gobert and Wembanyama, and a solid supporting cast, positions them as the primary challengers to Team USA's quest for Olympic gold. The showdown between these two basketball powerhouses promises to be a thrilling and high-stakes battle on the global stage.\n\nRelated: Kawhi Leonard Withdraws From Team USA For 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Short, sweet and to the point,\" said Team USA center Bam Adebayo, summarizing the vice president's message.\n\n\"A great reminder of the fact that we're playing for our country,\" added Team USA coach Steve Kerr, who has met Harris, an Oakland, Calif., native, several times. \"I think the guys really listened to every word. It was great.\"\n\nHarris, in the state of Nevada to make a campaign appearance and speech Tuesday, strode across the court at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas following the Americans' final practice in preparation for Wednesday's exhibition game against Canada -- the first 2024 Olympics tune-up for both countries.\n\nThe entire team, coaching staff and large USA Basketball support staff gathered around the vice president for a short speech, which was out of earshot of reporters, and then posed for pictures.\n\nHarris is a noted Golden State Warriors fan, where Kerr coaches in the NBA and Stephen Curry stars. She was present when the Warriors visited the White House in celebration of their 2022 NBA championship, and on Tuesday posed privately for a picture with Kerr and chatted with Curry after her speech.\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, is also a noted NBA fan, though he roots for the Los Angeles Lakers (LeBron James and Anthony Davis of the Lakers are on Team USA this summer).\n\n\"Pretty special moment for the entire group,\" said Erik Spoelstra, an assistant coach with Team USA. \"She just mentioned that we represent our country and everybody is going to be watching and rooting for us. It's a big responsibility.\"\n\nAdebayo, who was on the Olympic team three years ago in Tokyo, when strict protocols were still in place due to COVID-19, said that the group of gold medalists didn't

He sported the number in his Olympic debut in 1984 before he ever played in the NBA, and he returned to No. 9 as a member of the 1992 Dream Team.\n\nJordan isn't the only star American basketball player to switch up their jerseys at the Olympics.

Here's a look back at where the tradition started and what NBA and WNBA stars will sport in Paris.\n\nWhy do USA Basketball teams only use jersey numbers 4-15?\n\nOld international basketball rules restricted players to Nos. 4-15 to make it easier on game officials to communicate with hand signals, per NBC Olympics' Nick Zaccardi.\n\nFIBA dropped the rule in 2014, but USA Basketball still uses Nos. 4-15 for its men's and women's teams to maintain a level of tradition.\n\nDo USA Basketball players wear the same jersey numbers they do in the NBA and WNBA?\n\nNot every USA Basketball player can wear their NBA or WNBA jersey number at the Olympics.\n\nOf course, not every Team USA player wears a jersey number between 4-15 on their professional team. Additionally, multiple members of an Olympic team could wear the same number in the pros.\n\nJust two players on the U.S. men's basketball team for the 2024 Olympics will wear their NBA jersey number in Paris: Anthony Edwards (No. 5) and Bam Adebayo (No. 13). Not a single player on the U.S. women's basketball team will do the same with their WNBA jerseys.\n\nTeam USA men's basketball jersey numbers for 2024 Olympics\n\nTeam USA women's basketball jersey numbers for 2024 Olympics\n\nDo other countries also follow the old Olympic basketball jersey number rule?\n\nTwo other countries joined the U.S. by only using Nos. 4-15 on their basketball rosters: Australia (men's and women's) and China (women's).", "source": {"uri": "necn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NECN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_molski@necn.com", "name": "Max Molski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.necn.com/2024/07/web-240709-steph-stewie.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Team USA and Canada now have an understanding of which squads they will need to get through in their respective groups during their quests for gold medals.\n\nIn the meantime, both powerhouses have five exhibition games scheduled so each team can get more comfortable playing together. The first such Showcase game takes place in Las Vegas on Wednesday (10:30 p.m. ET, FS1, Fubo) and pits them against each other -- U.S. vs. Canada -- in the most star-studded friendly match of the summer.\n\nThe teams will then travel to Abu Dhabi and London for more exhibitions, then to Paris for the start of the Olympic games on July 27 and 28. It's a wild stretch of hoops, but both the Americans and Canadians have said they're ready to show up and show out for their respective countries.\n\nLet's dive into the details of Wednesday's exhibition between Team USA and Team Canada, then make an official prediction for the game. We will then take a look at each team's roster and full Olympic schedule, as well as all 12 teams' odds to win gold.\n\nAs of right Tuesday afternoon, no odds have been made available for this exhibition match in Vegas. Sportsbooks probably don't want to take on too much liability with a friendly USA Showcase match, especially so early in the summer when nobody quite knows what kind of usage certain stars will see.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada top the sportsbooks' odds to win the 2024 Olympics, so it stands to reason that neither USA head coach Steve Kerr nor Canadian coach Jordi Fernandez want to give away too much strategy weeks before the actual Olympic games begin. How these squads play Wednesday could very well differ from how they plan at the end of July and beginning of August.\n\nThat said, expect Team USA to still run the show. This team serves as one of the better rosters ever constructed in Olympic hoops, and the U.S. has a reputation to uphold with 16 gold medals including one for each of the past four summer games (Tokyo 2020, Rio 2016, London 2012, Beijing 2008). Once the Olympic field of 12 was set following the FIBA last-chance qualifiers, the USA opened as a massive -390 favorite to win it all once again.\n\nThis USA squad has the size to contend with big men like Serbia's Nikola Jokic and Greece's Giannis Antetokounmpo, perimeter defense and outside shooting to match those international focuses, and proven winners (with 16 combined NBA championships between the 12 players). Comparatively, Canada has very little size and just one player with an NBA championship ring -- Jamal Murray -- since Andrew Wiggins will not play this summer due to medical reasons.\n\nUSA checks every box, and it's tough to imagine this team losing even one game this summer. Even in a friendly exhibition game, this squad should come out on top thanks to size, sheer volume of talent on both ends of the floor, and incomparable depth. It will still be a fun watch because this might be the best Canadian team of all time -- but Team USA should take care of business on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType":

The pair shared their all-time starting five for Team USA and happened to name the same five players.\n\nPG: Stephen Curry\n\nSG: Michael Jordan\n\nSF: Kobe Bryant\n\nPF: LeBron James\n\nC: Shaquille O'Neal\n\nThe pair explained why both came up with this lineup.\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis: \"We've got a dominant big and we've got a four-man who can play the point and pass the ball. We have the best shooter ever and we've got two of the best two-way players and the greatest mentalities ever. It's finished.\"\n\nBrandin Podziemski: \"I feel like it just makes sense... A little bit of everything\"\n\nThat is a phenomenal five-man lineup to use for an all-time Team USA team. While the names are more attractive than their actual production on the biggest stage, no national team lineup could beat these five in their prime.\n\nLeBron James has the third-most points in Team USA history (273) and could win his third Gold medal in Paris 2024. Michael Jordan's presence in the 1992 Dream Team is what allowed that team to transcend culture, with his influence catapulting USA Basketball to new levels.\n\nKobe Bryant has won one Gold medal, but Stephen Curry has never represented Team USA in the Olympics. Naturally, Podz and TJD had to mention their franchise superstar, but his inclusion based on history is the weakest.\n\nTwo notable omissions have to be mentioned when you talk about Team USA, namely Kevin Durant and Charles Barkley.\n\nDurant could become the greatest basketball Olympian by winning his fourth Gold medal in Paris this year, so his status in a list like this should be unquestionable. He's also the all-time points leader for the USA in international basketball with 435 points on 19.7 points per game.\n\nBarkley was the best player on the iconic 1992 Dream Team, with coach Chucky Daly featuring Barkley as the primary scorer due to his size and agility making him virtually impossible to guard. He averaged 16.3 points and 6.7 rebounds over that Olympic run.\n\nAlmost every all-time great American player has played for the national team since the 1990s, with their predecessors playing as collegiate athletes before being barred from competing in the Olympics as NBA players. In terms of all-time names, these five players are arguably the highest-profile players to have donned the jersey.\n\nEven with the achievements of Durant and Barkley, their status is not as high as the other five. Even though it's a Team USA starting five, it's almost impossible to make a 'bad' choice when it comes to an all-time list.\n\nBig Season Ahead For Podziemski And Jackson-Davis\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have seemingly avoided falling into flux by maneuvering Klay Thompson's departure into a sign-and-trade that landed them Buddy Hield and Kyle Anderson, along with the signing of De'Anthony Melton. But these are surrounding pieces behind a core that features Stephen Curry and the young stars on the team.\n\nPodziemski's emergence as a rookie probably allowed the Warriors to allow Klay Thompson to walk as a free agent, as Podz averaged 9.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.7 assists. He took the starting spot from Klay at points last season, so it's clear he'll retain that position to start the 2024-25 season, coming off an All-Rookie First Team nod.\n\nJackson-Davis seems to be the center for the future for the Warriors, falling to them with the 57th pick in the 2023 Draft. He averaged 7.9 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks, giving the Warriors center insurance behind Kevon Looney for the first time in years. He should expect to play bigger minutes, but a starting role isn't penciled in especially if Draymond Green moves to being their full-time center.\n\nRelated: Ranking The Greatest USA Dream Teams Including The 2024 Avengers\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Last summer's World Cup team struggled with size and physicality, leading to significant losses. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embiid are now poised to change that narrative, as reported by Joe Vardon of The Athletic.\n\nAnthony Davis highlighting the importance of addressing the team's weaknesses said:\n\n\"They feel like we got bullied last year.\"\n\nDavis, with his 7-6 wingspan and recent first-team All-Defense honor, is a crucial addition to bolster the team's interior presence. He emphasized the need to stop the bullying and set a new tone for Team USA. Davis finished the season averaging 24.6 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game.\n\nEmbiid, standing at 7 feet and weighing about 280 pounds, brings immense scoring and defensive abilities. His career-high 34.7 points per game last season for the Philadelphia 76ers, along with 11.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks, underscores his dominant presence on the court.\n\nBam Adebayo, although the shortest of the trio at 6-9, has proven his mettle as Team USA's starting center during the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"I feel like we will definitely set the tone early, no matter who is in the game.\"\n\nAdebayo, coming off a first-team All-Defense season, echoed the sentiment of toughness and resilience. He emphasized the importance of establishing dominance from the start.\n\nThe addition of these three defensive stalwarts aims to counteract the weaknesses exposed in the previous World Cup, where the U.S. was often out-muscled in the paint. Their presence is expected to transform Team USA's approach, focusing on physicality, rebounding, and interior defense.\n\nWith the first exhibition game against Canada approaching, the team is set to demonstrate their newfound strength. The trio of Davis, Embiid, and Adebayo, along with contributions from LeBron James and Kevin Durant, aim to redefine Team USA's identity, making them formidable contenders for the gold medal in Paris.\n\nAs Bam Adebayo aptly put it, \"You put a team like this together, and we play the right way, it's going to be hard to beat us.\"\n\nFrance Is The Only Team Which Can Match Up To Team USA\n\nFrance, with their towering defensive duo of Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, stands as the only team that can truly challenge Team USA at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Gobert, standing at 7-1, and the 7-5 rookie sensation Wembanyama, have both showcased their defensive prowess by finishing as the winner and runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award this season.\n\nThe combination of Gobert and Wembanyama creates a formidable presence in the paint, capable of disrupting even the most potent offenses. Gobert's shot-blocking and rebounding abilities are well-documented, having anchored the Utah Jazz's defense for years and now with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nHis experience and positioning make him a vital piece of France's defensive scheme. On the other hand, Wembanyama's unique blend of height, agility, and shot-blocking instinct adds a new dimension to the French defense. His ability to alter shots and protect the rim makes him a significant threat to any team attempting to score inside.\n\nOne of the critical advantages for France is the absence of the NBA's three-second rule in international play, allowing their big men to camp in the paint and deter any drives to the basket. This rule difference plays perfectly into the hands of France's defensive strategy, making it difficult for opponents to penetrate and score easy baskets.\n\nTeam USA, with its array of superstar talent, including LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry, will need to be at their absolute best to overcome this defensive juggernaut.\n\nThe presence of Gobert and Wembanyama means that the Americans will have to rely heavily on their perimeter shooting and ball movement to find open shots. Penetrating the French defense will be a significant challenge, and Team USA's guards and wings will need to be precise and efficient in their execution.\n\nThe perimeter players for France, including seasoned veterans and rising stars, are also crucial in supporting their defensive anchors. Players like Evan Fournier and Nicolas Batum bring experience and versatility, capable of both scoring and defending at a high level. Their ability to stretch the floor and create opportunities will be vital for France's overall performance.\n\nFrance's combination of elite defense, anchored by Gobert and Wembanyama, and a solid supporting cast, positions them as the primary challengers to Team USA's quest for Olympic gold. The showdown between these two basketball powerhouses promises to be a thrilling and high-stakes battle on the global stage.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

That USA team was nicknamed Dream Team after routing the competition in the 1992 Barcelona Games and is widely considered the greatest basketball team of all time.\n\nAs USA Basketball's managing director, Hill has put together his own elite collection of Americans for the 2024 Paris Games led by the NBA's career leading scorer LeBron James, the NBA's career 3-point leader Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum and many more stars. So, knowing what it would take to beat the Dream Team, could the 2024 USA Basketball squad beat Jordan & Co.?\n\n\"Comparing eras is always difficult,\" Hill told Andscape. \"It would be an exciting game. I'm not going to answer that question. I'm not going to incriminate myself. I don't know. We beat them in a scrimmage. It wasn't a real game. It's hard to say. I don't know.\n\n\"At this point in time, I don't know. But ask me at the end of the Olympics.\"\n\nOn April 3, 2021, USA Basketball hired Hill as the 2021-24 managing director of the USA men's national team. Hill succeeded Jerry Colangelo as managing director after the Tokyo Games. The 1996 Olympic gold medalist is a 19-season NBA veteran who is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and won two NCAA championships at Duke University. Hill played for five USA Basketball teams, won two gold medals and one bronze medal and compiled an overall record of 26-1. Hill's first USA Basketball team as managing director, however, finished in fourth place in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nUSA Basketball plays in its first exhibition game Wednesday night against a star-studded Canadian team at T-Mobile Center. But with a group primarily of veteran NBA stars led by James, USA Basketball is expected to win its fifth-straight gold medal.\n\nHill took part in the following Q&A with Andscape on Monday and talked about being the first African American to hold his position with USA Basketball, James, the key to success for gold, the challenges of putting the roster together, playing against the Dream Team and much more.\n\nAs the main person that put this Olympic team together, what is it like when you see the likes of LeBron, Steph Curry, Durant, Tatum, etc., arrive?\n\nWhen I landed here Wednesday, it's like, 'OK, it's real.' And then as guys started arriving, Steph got in late Thursday night and then we saw Bam [Adebayo] in [Friday] morning and guys slowly coming in, we had a welcome sort of meeting. So, it was sort of the first time that we're all together. Tatum got in Sunday night. To see everybody together, it was a bit surreal in a way. And then [head coach] Steve [Kerr] and I, we talked to the team and we addressed them, we welcomed them. We talked about what this is, and then we all kind of went in the other room and had dinner, just real informal.\n\nHere we are. We're ready to go. And I think there's a nervousness. I'm not a coach, but I went through it as a player. But now, kind of on the other side as management, there's a nervousness for that first meeting and there's a nervousness for the first practice. And once you get through those two firsts, you fall into the routine of it. And there may be some nervousness for our first exhibition game. But getting to [last] Saturday night, it was like, 'OK, I can exhale a little bit and get a little rest.'\n\nJust seeing all these guys -- all this talent in the same room and all these guys are on the same team and you've seen some of them together in All-Star games and pickup games -- but to know you're going in the trenches with these guys and looking at them, you're like, 'Wow.' Half the guys are [going to be] in the Hall of Fame and then the other half are on their way. And so, there was a little bit of awe watching them interact with each other and I respect their excitement. I sensed it when we handed out jerseys before the playoffs, the one-on-one encounters. And they were really excited almost in some cases like kids to the surprise of formally and officially being selected. To see that same excitement when they got together was really cool.\n\nWhat's the main message you and Steve gave them?\n\nThe main thing is the FIBA game is different than the NBA game. And that's something that we will just continue to emphasize the whole way. And there's things that we're doing from a film standpoint, from a drilling standpoint, to just reinforce and maybe change some of our habits that work in the NBA but need to be altered a bit with FIBA competition. We told some personal stories, but it was good and I was excited to see how receptive they were. All these guys, from the time they've been selected, they've been responsive, they've been professional, whether it's texting, conversations, just getting ourselves ready for this moment. It's been impressive -- their desire, their engagement, their professionalism.\n\nHow easy and hard was it to put the roster together?\n\nThat's a great question. The way you phrased it is appropriate. It was overwhelming, the excitement and the interest from our players here in the U.S. Everybody wanted to be a part of this, and that's a really good thing. It speaks to what the experience is, what USA Basketball is, the Olympics. Maybe it's Paris. But it also speaks to these guys making exorbitant amounts of money and these guys wanting to be a part of this. So, we had a pool of players to pull from, which I don't know if we've had that large of a pool of guys expressing interest probably in quite some time, maybe not since 2012. And so, from that standpoint, it made it great.\n\nWhat was tough was that you only had 12 spots. You wish you could have had a roster of 15. You could have had a roster of 20. Because there's so many guys that are deserving -- guys that had won championships and All-Stars and won gold medals for us, guys who've been a part of our program -- and you want to honor those guys and you want guys who have experience. We have 10 guys on this team who have had FIBA experience. We have eight guys who've won gold medals, whether it's Olympic gold medals or World Cup, a World Championship in Steph's case. So, that institutional knowledge and understanding that FIBA is different, they know, they understand that. The challenge is, it's like a puzzle, man. You got to put the pieces together that fit and that complement. And so, as a result, you are leaving guys off who are really good and guys that I'm a fan of. I'm a fan of a number of the guys that weren't on the team.\n\nBut a coach once told me that a team is like a piano recital. You got piano movers, You got piano tuners, and you got piano players. And you need all three to put on a good show. You can't have all piano players. And so that may fit this or may not, but you need roles and you need guys that fit. And so it wasn't that I didn't like guys, it was just I got to put together a team. So, that was hard. And that was also having to tell people, call people and let them know that they're not on the team.\n\nSo, you actually called players and told them they didn't make the team?\n\nI did. And if I couldn't reach certain people, I spoke to their agents. So, as we were going around handing out jerseys, it became apparent that certain people were about to leak it. So, now we're scrambling. I felt like these guys deserve to hear it from me. Not everyone, but certain guys. And so, I called a number of guys and had to have that conversation. And it wasn't easy, but I think they deserved that. They all were difficult. Everyone was very professional and understanding and respectful, so there was no issue.\n\nThe main thing, though, is the guys were thrilled [to get their jerseys] and for us to capture those moments and surprise them with the jerseys, that was a nice touch and it was great that we could execute it under the radar in this day and age, which we did for the most part.\n\nWho was the most touched by getting the USA jersey?\n\nSymbolically, the first person I went to speak to formally about the Olympics was Joel [Embiid]. And that was back in fall of '22, actually a week before their opening night. And I knew that earlier that year he had obtained his French citizenship and we found out that summer he obtained his U.S. citizenship. So, I called up [Philadelphia 76ers general manager] Elton Brand in early October. I said, 'Hey, man, I got to get an audience with Joel. Can you help facilitate that or come to practice, whatever?' Shout-out to Elton. He basically connected me and said, he wants you to come to his house. So, I went to his house ...\n\nBut I didn't know if he'd give me 10 minutes, he'd give me 30 minutes. So, I sat with him and his assistant 90 minutes. It was an incredible conversation. He was thoughtful, engaging, asked great questions. I thought he knew a lot about the logistics and Lille. He had done his homework, didn't commit to anything. But I was just impressed with who he is. I didn't know him that well. I interviewed him once for Inside Stuff years ago. Really smart, really thoughtful. And I felt like he really wanted to play in a FIBA competition. And so, it was a sales job, but it was also just talking and answering questions. And so, we kept in contact via text. So, I felt like, now let me go to him first. He was the first guy I spoke to. He's the first guy. And I'm not saying there was a pecking order or anything like that, but everyone else didn't have a choice of what country to play for. He had a choice [of us, France and Cameroon] and he chose us and it was beautiful.\n\nSo camp is beginning and there was some noise about the French team and the managing director there putting some stuff out, almost like an ultimatum, if I remember correctly. I called Elton like, 'Hey man, training camp, I want to come see Joel. Let me know if it's OK.' And this was Oct. 3 and my birthday is Oct. 5. And so, Elton is like, come tomorrow. I said, 'I'll come to Philly.' He said, 'Oh, we're in Boulder, Colorado.' And so, I fly out to Boulder and they're doing training camp out there. There was a beat writer there in the hotel. So, I had to act like, 'Yeah, I'm here doing the television, I work in media. I'm here doing a little TV interview.' But we had a little conference room and we sat and talked and a continuation of the conversation from the year before.\n\nAnd I answered questions and I told him, 'Look, we're not giving you an ultimatum. We have time. And so, I just want you to have peace of mind with whatever decision you make. Good to have options.' And so, he said, 'I'll let you know when I'm ready.' And I flew out and he called me the next morning and said, 'Happy birthday, I'm playing with you guys.' Wow. So, I told my wife, 'You got to top that birthday present!' But it was good, Joel, they all were excited.\n\nI did Joel, it was tough logistics. We had three or four days. Steve Kerr did Steph. Spo [USA Basketball assistant coach Erik Spoelstra] did Bam. [USA Basketball assistant coach] Ty Lue did Kawhi [Leonard]. [men's national team director] Sean Ford did LeBron and AD [Anthony Davis] because they were in New Orleans. And then I hopped around Philly, Minnesota, got Ant [Anthony Edwards] and then KD and Book [Devin Booker]. They were there, Boston and then Indy [for Tyrese Haliburton]. They were going to get Steph after his game. I was in Philly that night. I did Joel's game and [Golden State Warriors senior vice president of communications] Raymond Ridder was going to call me on FaceTime when they were doing the whole thing. And so literally it's like 2:30 in the morning, I'm sleeping, I'm in the hotel in Philly. Phone rings, I wake up, and Raymond's like, and he gives me the steps. So, I don't know what I said, but even over the phone on FaceTime, this guy [Curry] has done everything and he was fired up. They all were. So that was really, really special.\n\nWhat did you learn from your USA team finishing fourth in the 2023 FIBA World Cup and did anything pain you from it?\n\nI learned a lot. You can interview others who've gone through it. You can watch a ton of tape, but unless you go through that experience, it's hard to really understand what it's all about. And there's just an understanding of how different the game is, how it's officiated, how hard it is, how long it can be, how everything's accelerated; the habits need to change. That played a lot for me in shaping this roster. And I think there's more diversity and styles of play in the international game than there are in the NBA. Not [many] teams over there play two bigs in the paint like they did 25 years ago. We don't see that in this game. But then you see a team like Canada who goes small and they spread it out. And so, you get different styles. We have the ability to play different styles and hopefully play well. Joel is someone that we haven't had in years. Dwight Howard was the last true center in '08. But Dwight was great defensively and rebound. He wasn't necessarily offensively what Joel is. Prior to that, you got to go back to '96 with Shaq [O'Neal], Hakeem [Olajuwon] and David Robinson.\n\nWe had some versatility. We have flexibility. We can go big, we can go small. We have shooting and we have experience. Our guys last summer were great. They gave us everything. They were young and this was their first FIBA experience and I think they'll be better for it if they get the opportunity down the road.\n\nYou're the first African American to be the managing director of USA Basketball. Any thoughts on that?\n\nOne hundred percent, I think about that. I'm very aware of that and I understand there's a responsibility that comes with that. And we have to succeed. We have to have success, and not just for USA Basketball, not just for whoever might succeed me one day and having someone else being inclusive in terms of who that person is. But I just think in all sports management positions it's important for us to have success and do it the right way. And so, there's a burden of responsibility, an opportunity, however you want to look at it.\n\nBut I'm very conscious of it and proud of that and I'm excited for that. And this was something that I wanted, I sought this out and I'm grateful that USA Basketball strives to be inclusive. And I think not just with the staff that's based in Colorado Springs, but with the women's team and with 3-on-3. We should reflect the country that we represent. And USA basketball 100 percent lives that and embraces that. I'm grateful for the opportunity and that just creates opportunities for the next person of color.\n\nDo you feel more pressure for this to succeed than anything else you have done in basketball?\n\nOne hundred percent. As a player, it's just a different pressure. As a player, there's pressure but then when competition starts you get lost in the game and you're just competing. There's a bit of an arm's length distance between being on the management side versus being a player or even being a coach, for that matter. But it's not just because I'm a Black man. It's also because we're USA. There's an expectation in any sport for us to do well, but particularly basketball. We're at an interesting time in the game of basketball in terms of where it's at on a global stage. And what I mean by that, you have 30% of the NBA is international players. A number of recent MVPs are international players.\n\nWe've had some teams in the last 20 years on the FIBA stage who are contenders. Argentina had a great run. Spain had a great team as well. France gave us everything we could handle in '21. Now you have five teams that believe they can contend. And so, it's an interesting, on one hand, growth of the game, the globalization of the game, the impact of David Stern and the Dream Team in '92 and all the moves and things that have happened since then that have inspired multiple generations. The game is now where it's at, and it's beautiful and it's great for business. USA Basketball makes it a little harder. We have champions, we have legends, we have competitors. Part of why they want to do this is they want that challenge and they want to show that we could be the best.\n\nThere is 100% pressure. You feel it. I still have that bad taste in my mouth from last summer. When you play in NBA as a player and you have a game and you have a bad night, you can't wait for that next game. And you hope it's a back-to-back so you quickly can get that bad taste out of your mouth. You got three days in between games, so I'm ready to play again. I'm ready to go through this. And it's a similar feeling, just a little bit more.\n\nGetting LeBron James to join the Olympic team, what does that mean at this stage of his career and his longevity?\n\nIt's a credit to him. At this stage with all that he's done, he wants to do this. When Joel committed. LeBron texted me, 'Good job.' He's in. Not only is he in, he's emotionally invested. I didn't know LeBron that well. I'm a little old school. But I've gotten to know him and connect with him more so over this last year. I've just been impressed with his passion for the game, his passion for USA Basketball and his desires. You would think he's Year 3, never won, hungry. All that he's done, he is approaching this as if he's accomplished nothing. And that's in part what makes him so unique and certainly one of the best to ever do it.\n\nWhat was it like to wear that jersey as you did as a member USA Basketball's gold medal winning team in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics?\n\nIt's big. I was young when I wore it and probably didn't fully appreciate it. I was the youngest guy on the team in '96 and I just assumed that I'd have more opportunities and that was taken from me for the injuries. But growing up watching the Olympics, watching Carl Lewis, watching Mary Lou Retton, watching Edwin Moses and the '84 Olympic team ... You can represent Duke or you can represent the [Detroit] Pistons. But when you're representing your country, there's a real honor and there's a privilege.\n\nAnd even with some of the challenges that we have at times with our country, it's still an honor and a privilege and it's big. There's a pride that comes with that. There's a pride wearing the USA basketball polo. And I'm not an overly patriotic person, but you feel that sense [of pride]. You feel that honor when you put it on.\n\nYou mother, Janet Hill, made her impact on this country serving as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Army, a liaison to the office of the Secretary of Defense, the White House, the Congress and other government agencies and was also appointed by President Obama as a member of the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She died in 2022 knowing you were in this position with USA Basketball. What did your connection to USA Basketball mean to her?\n\nMy mom would probably be here in Vegas right now. She would definitely be in Paris with us on the trip. When COVID just happened and we all instantly shut down, this is when I kind of concocted this idea. I had heard that Jerry Colangelo and [the 2020] Olympics were to be his last. And sometimes I am an idea-a-minute. I am always thinking of interesting things, opportunities, ideas. And I remember talking to her and saying, 'What do you think about if I pursued this? You think I'm crazy for wanting this.' And so, she was the one that encouraged me, 'No, you got to do it. You have to do it.' And so, a lot was going on and the league and [NBA] bubble. And so fast-forward to a year later, '21, I was in the bubble in Indianapolis for the Final Four. And I was getting ready to do my first game [broadcast]. I was actually at West Lafayette outside of the arena where Purdue plays. I was on the phone with someone from the board at USA basketball and they basically told me I had been selected. And the first person I called was my mom. And then she got sick later that summer.\n\nSo, she knew. She was excited. And so, she would be proud. She was proud of everything I did. But she would've been there. She probably would've been sitting on the other side of [my wife] Tamia, or maybe I would've been sandwich in between the two of them at the games. But she loved sports, she loved competition. She loved to go to events. She even would go to All-Star game and post up in the lobby, come to the Final Four. And there is no greater event than this.\n\nAnd of course, my dad as well, my parents have always been supportive and proud. And I think my dad, he's not flying nowhere. He's a homebody. So, they've been great. He's been great. He has been asking, 'How do the guys look?' It's great to always get that support from them.\n\nWhat was it like being on the Select Team that practiced against the Dream Team in 1992 and beat them in a scrimmage?\n\nIt was a while ago, but it was a different time back then as a top player in high school, even college. It's a chance you've met one of these elite pros. With the exception of Christian [Laettner] and Pat Ewing because I was around Georgetown, I had never met any of these guys. I don't think any of our guys on the Select Team had either. I had Magic's [Johnson] poster and Michael's [Jordan] poster on my wall in my dorm. And then next thing you know, I'm going out here and I'm playing against him. It's a different time now.\n\nI've talked to Allan Houston, [Chris] Webber, Penny [Hardaway], when I see them. That may have been the best basketball experience of my life, looking at it through the lens of a 19-year-old. And I had just won two national championships and that summer I got a chance to do that. Man, I could have retired right then and there ...\n\nThe first day I guarded Michael. I just remember that feeling. I guarded him many times afterwards. We found out three weeks before and the next thing you know, I'm like, I'm guarding Michael Jordan. And look around. it's Magic. All my heroes are right here. We spent time with them. First time I ever golfed was with Scottie Pippen. We were in the room when they were gambling. Just being around them. It wasn't just on the court. They took us under their wing. So, we got a chance to hang out with them. And it was one of those things where the scrimmage, the time with them, you can't even describe how incredible it was. No one believed you. You can't even put into words what that feeling was like for all of us. It was incredible.", "source": {"uri": "andscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andscape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_j_spears@andscape.com", "name": "Marc J.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOn Wednesday, Team USA announced that Kawhi Leonard was withdrawing from the 2024 Paris Olympics. It didn't take much time for reports to emerge regarding who would replace the former Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nMarc J. Spears reported for Andscape that Boston Celtics star role player Derrick White would be tabbed to replace Leonard on Team USA. White had a career year for the reigning champs, averaging 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game.\n\nWhite's familiarity with Steve Kerr's Olympic scheme and his teammates were likely the driving factors in the decision. He played on the 2019 FIBA World Cup team, when Kerr was an assistant, and of course just finished a title run with Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday. Now the trio will go for gold together.\n\nWhite's skillset and defending will be paramount to Team USA's gold medal quest this year. He's outstanding locking down opposing guards and plays bigger than his size in the paint. Offensively White is a good passer and connector who is perfectly content to get zero shots up if it means his team wins. Being able to impact the game without dominating the ball is a crucial skill for an American side featuring all-time greats like Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant, all of whom are best with the ball in their hands.\n\nIt's tougher than ever for Team USA to dominate on the world stage. White is now part of the journey to try and earn the country's fifth straight first place Olympic finish.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andscape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andscape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4021,h_2261,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j2ema3hyk8mb47netx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713463", "eventUri": "eng-9713463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

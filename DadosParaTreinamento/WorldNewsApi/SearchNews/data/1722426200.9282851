{"id": 243311194, "title": "Full list of every unsolved murder in the West Midlands since 1940s as dozens of killers free", "text": "They are the tragic murder victims who have been left without justice for years and even decades. More than 100 men, women and children have been killed across the West Midlands - and yet their murderers have never been found. The full list of unsolved murders stretching back as far as the 1940s has now been detailed as part of an exclusive Freedom of Information request from West Midlands Police. The force shared the names, dates and locations behind the tragedies which have, for years, left puzzled detectives unable to achieve justice for the victims and their loved ones. In the most recent 'unsolved murder' from March last year, a loving and devoted dad, described as \"larger than life\" by his family, was fatally assaulted at a pub in West Bromwich. Detectives are also still hunting a 'brothel killer' who stabbed a man to death following a suspected robbery in Digbeth.

A further 16 victims are still without justice from the 2010s, including a son found dead inside a disused factory in a 'set-up' and a horrifying murder where an industrial-sized firework was pushed through a man's letterbox. Police at the time hoped to break the community's silence and solve the cold-blooded case, but they have yet to find the thugs. In another tragedy several years before, a man was stabbed to death inside his Handsworth flat; the motive for his murder has remained a mystery ever since. And since the 1990s, detectives have failed to find the killer behind one of the city's most notorious crimes, the brutal triple murder of the Smith family in Northfield. The bodies of Harold and Mary Smith and their paralysed son, Harold Junior, were found at their home in December 1992. They had been bound and repeatedly stabbed before they were killed. Sadly, they are just a few of those on a long list of unsolved murders across Birmingham, the Black Country and Coventry over the past nine decades. Responding to the updated list from the force, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster has now urged anyone with information to contact the police \"immediately\" amid ongoing work to solve each tragedy. He said: \u201cAn unsolved murder adds untold distress, upset and trauma to the victims\u2019 family and friends, who are already grieving the loss of a loved one. It\u2019s vital that justice is served and that is why West Midlands Police work around the clock to bring perpetrators of the most heinous crimes to justice. \"If any member of the community has any information that could help officers solve these cases then I would urge that person to contact the police immediately.\u201d Below is a full list of those still awaiting justice for their murders as anyone with information on any of the incidents is urged to get in touch. 2020s Darren Round, Kings Norton February 15, 2020 Kevin Lomas, Hall Green April 2, 2021 Martin Howells, Wolverhampton August

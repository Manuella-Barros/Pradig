services register.\n\nSchools, a leisure centre and a theatre in the area have been forced to close.\n\nSouthern Water said in an update this morning: \"Our teams worked through the night to remove the broken pipe and replace it with a new length of pipework.\n\n\"We are making good progress on the repair.\n\n\"When the repair work is completed, we will then recharge the network and restart our water supply works.\n\n\"However, this will take time and we expect disruption to continue over the weekend.\"\n\nThe company added that the burst main is located in Keeper's Wood \"deep in woodland\", which is making it difficult for crews and machinery to reach it.\n\nSouthern Water spokesman Tim McMahon said the burst is in the \"most difficult location\" he has ever seen.\n\nSouthern Water engineers worked through the night on the pipe (Image: Southern Water)\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"This burst is in a very, very difficult location, I've been in industry for 20 years, it is by far the most difficult location I've ever seen.\n\n\"You know, we've had to fell 50 trees just to get to the burst.\"\n\nLesley Arshad lives in St Leonards, is disabled and told the Today programme she has been left off the priority list by the water company.\n\nShe said she contacted the company to be put on the priority list last year and was sent a letter confirming it, but when she rang on Thursday to ask for water was told she was not on the priority list.\n\nShe said: \"I rang the customer service representative and he said that I wasn't on the list and I said that I had received a letter from Southern Water to say that I was.\n\n\"He said 'oh it's probably because you live in a flat' but he said I would get some water but not sure when I would get it.\"\n\nA spokesman for Southern Water said they have been in touch with Ms Arshad and will be delivering water to her on Saturday.\n\nThey added: \"We're supplying more than 6,000 vulnerable customers who are on our priority service register in the affected area, and will investigate any issues where people who are on our list to receive water haven't.\"\n\nPeter Haldane, 43, of The Highlands Inn Hotel & Bar, told the Telegraph he had to queue for three hours to collect 30 bottles of water.\n\nHe said there was no running water at the hotel, which expects to lose thousands of pounds in revenue.\n\n\"We had 10 rooms fully booked and we're expecting that nine will cancel.\n\nThis weekend is the annual four-day Jack In The Green Festival in Hastings, which Mr Haldane described as \"one of the biggest weekends of the year\".\n\nBottled water stations have been set up at Asda and Tesco in St Leonards and Sea Road in Hastings.\n\nThe White Rock Theatre was closed on Friday due to the water supply issue.\n\nThe theatre cancelled the Millie's Nightclub event, a pop-up nightclub for adults with learning disabilities, which was due to take place on Friday and Brown Boots Boogie Band, The Big Ceilidh at Jack In The Green on Saturday.\n\nIt posted on its website saying it is \"deeply disappointing\" that the issue coincided with the area's annual Jack In The Green celebrations.\n\nSummerfields Leisure Centre posted on Facebook on Friday afternoon saying: \"Due to Southern Waters disrupted supply the centre is currently without any running water and therefore cannot open until the supply resumes.\n\n\"As this problem does not seem to have a quick fix we have made the decision to close the centre for the rest of the day and will update tomorrow when we know more.\"\n\nA notice on Churchwood Primary Academy's website says it is closed as there is no water supply in the area.\n\nSt Paul's Church of England Academy in St Leonards was closed on Friday.",

We've got nothing to drink. We don't have a water tank in our house so as soon as it ran out we had nothing,\" he told BBC Sussex.\n\nHe added that there was an \"extensive ongoing issue\" with the water firm.\n\n\"We've had constant sewage leaks into the sea, we've had sewage pipes bursting just along the way here,\" said Mr Sparks.\n\nKaren Arthur, also picking up water in the town, said she initially thought a neighbour warning about water shortages on Thursday night \"was a joke\".\n\n\"I filled my kettle, my water bottle and another jug and put it in the fridge and got back into bed thinking it'd be fine,\" she said.\n\n\"Woke up this morning - no water... I've got a friend visiting today, I'm going out tonight. It's going to be a very funky evening.\"\n\nSummerfields Leisure Centre in Hastings is currently closed until its water supply resumes.\n\nBottled water stations are also open at Asda and Tesco in St Leonards.\n\nSouthern Water said it was delivering bottled water to vulnerable customers on its priority services register.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Leonards-on-Sea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Leonards-on-Sea"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Leonards-on-Sea"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East Sussex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Sussex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hastings United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water supply network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bottled water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Sussex College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Church,_Brighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Church, Brighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537321", "eventUri": "eng-9537321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

The burst threatens to leave residents unable to wash, flush toilets or prepare food.\n\nIt also comes ahead of a weekend of annual events, which will see thousands of visitors arrive in the town. One local hotel said it expects to lose \"thousands\" in revenue because of the water supply issues.\n\nThe problems are understood to have started on Thursday morning, when a 19-inch main pipe burst in an area of woodland to the north of Hastings, near Beauport Park Golf & Country Club.\n\nThe pipe, which connects Darwell Reservoir to a water supply works in Beaufort, is vital to the water supply to households in the centre and west of Hastings, as well as the majority in St Leonards.\n\nSouthern Water was forced to cut down about 50 trees to reach the pipe, with Tim McMahon, the water managing director, describing it as \"the most difficult location I've ever seen\" in an interview with BBC Radio Sussex.\n\nRepairs are ongoing but will likely continue into the weekend, the water company said.\n\nChurchwood Primary Academy, ARK Little Ridge Primary Academy, New Horizons School and St Paul's Church of England Academy in St Leonards are all closed, while East Sussex College's Station Plaza campus in Hastings, Westfield School and two College Central campuses have also been forced to shut temporarily.\n\nPeter Haldane, 43, who works at The Highlands Inn Hotel & Bar, said he had queued for three hours to collect 30 bottles of water. He told The Telegraph that there was no running water at the hotel, which expects to lose thousands of pounds in revenue this weekend.\n\n\"It's probably going to cost us thousands\", he said. \"We had 10 rooms fully booked and we're expecting that nine will cancel.\n\n\"That's \u00a3100 a night. They are well within their rights to cancel. We don't have working toilets or showers.\"\n\nHastings is set to host the annual four-day Jack in the Green Festival and the May Day Bike Run this bank holiday weekend, which usually sees thousands of people visit the town.\n\nMr Haldane described it as \"one of the biggest weekends of the year\" in Hastings, adding that his frustrations were with Southern Water and that his manager would be looking to seek compensation for the lost revenue.\n\nThe water company said its teams were working \"around-the-clock\" to fix the issue - but warned that it was \"likely to continue into the weekend\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "albert_tait@yahoo.com", "name": "Albert Tait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Woodland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Leonards-on-Sea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Leonards-on-Sea"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Leonards-on-Sea"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hastings United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leisure centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush_toilet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flush toilet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bottled water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwell_Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darwell Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauport_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beauport Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Sussex College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_in_the_Green", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack in the Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "May Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Church of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/d6RyGhtqvqbt3evdKwlplw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/e4bcc0ac31ea97efd442dc1635ec699f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537321", "eventUri": "eng-9537321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

water to more than 6,000 customers on its priority services register.\n\nSouthern Water said in an update on Friday evening: \"Our teams are continuing to work around-the-clock to remove the broken

In order to preserve supply to the local hospital as the network recharged, Southern Water said that around 3,500 homes would temporarily lose supply from Sunday afternoon.\n\nAlthough the pipe was repaired on Saturday, the company said waterworks had to be \"restarted\", adding that the burst main is located in Keeper's Wood, near the A21, \"deep in woodland\", making it difficult for crews and machinery to reach it.\n\nThe pipe burst on Thursday, meaning residents had no tap water and were left using sea and bottled water to flush their toilets.\n\nOne father of a 7-year-old and 12-year-old daughter, both of whom are autistic, said he struggled to reach the bottled water stations due to the \"gridlocked traffic\".\n\nJon Rands, from St Leonards, told i the \"unacceptable\" turn of events had been \"very tough going\" on his autistic children due to how important their sense of routine is.\n\n\"It has been diabolical if I'm honest\", he said.\n\n\"Anybody who lives with autistic children knows that routine is so important, as the day-to-day routine of my girls has been affected, and this has caused them to be upset and very anxious.\n\n\"We have been boiling water to wash ourselves for the last four days.\"\n\nMr Rands said the fourth water station only opened on Saturday before the supplies began to be \"rationed.\"\n\nHe said: \"Then they ran out of water, blaming the traffic for not being able to reach the ASDA and Tesco sites.\n\n\"On Saturday they also started rationing, allowances were reduced to 4 litres for each household.\n\n\"The underinvestment from Southern Water is so evident when incidents like this happen. We are a big seaside town. How can this happen?\"\n\nOver the weekend tens of thousands of tourists were expected for the May Day Bike Run and the annual Jack in the Green four-day festival, but many bars, cafes and restaurants were unable to open for business without running waters or functioning toilets.\n\nEast Sussex County Councillor Godfrey Daniel said the impact on businesses in Hastings would be \"drastic\".\n\nLaurence Bell who runs Hasting's White Rock Hotel was forced to wade into the sea to retrieve water to flush the toilets in his establishment, providing his guests with hand sanitiser, napkins and bottled water.\n\nMr Bell told i: \"It's far from ideal but we racked our brains as to how we can stay open, and we thought of a way, by flushing our toilets with seawater.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're lucky in that we only have to walk over to the sea to get water to flush our toilets.\n\n\"Other businesses have been forced to close. I'm not worried about hygiene, we've given all our guests hand gel and napkins, and lots of bottled water to boil.\n\n\"The sea water is only being used for flushing the toilet and washing dishes by hand.\"\n\nThe hotel manager said he would suffer significant losses this weekend, likely costing him \"twice as much\" as what is usually a full hotel is only at half capacity, with running costs rocketing due to the extra staff and resources needed.\n\n\"Customers' water supplies are gradually being restored in St Leonards and Hastings as we work hard to ensure our water supply works at Beauport consistently pumps treated water into our network,\" said Southern Water in its latest statement on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"This phased return of supplies to homes and businesses will see lower-lying areas and those nearest to Beauport coming back into supply first, with the remainder following as pressure increases in the pipes between now and tomorrow morning.\n\n\"Specifically, west and central areas of St Leonards-on-Sea, west Hastings and rural areas around Westfield should see supplies return gradually during the rest of Sunday.\"\n\nIt added: \"We thank customers for their understanding and apologise for the disruption this outage has caused, especially over the bank holiday weekend. We will continue to update our website and social media with our progress and keep you informed.\"\n\nSouthern Water added that as supplies return, customers may notice their water is cloudy.

We are so sorry for this, which as you will understand is completely outside our control.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_hallows@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Ruth Hallows", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Sussex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Sussex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_in_the_Green", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack in the Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Leonards-on-Sea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Leonards-on-Sea"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Leonards-on-Sea"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rock_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Rock Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hastings United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_and_Rye_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye,_East_Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rye, East Sussex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rye, East Sussex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UWgtP3n2jQDy2.k_8XcrtQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/488b38a36c69075b302e7bcb3917da04", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537321", "eventUri": "eng-9537321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

disruption in St Leonards-on-Sea and some areas of Hastings, due to a burst water main, started on Thursday and is expected to continue into Sunday.\n\nThe water outage has left residents using bottled water supplied by Southern Water from four collection points around the area, with many rationing their supplies as the issue continues.\n\nIt's quite worrying that a lot of these elderly people will be left with nothing\n\nThe company said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the loss of the water supply in the area and that it is delivering bottled water to more than 6,000 customers on its priority services register.\n\nJakki Blackman, 49, said her elderly mother, Christine Lawton, 72, had six of her 12 water bottles \"stolen\" after they were delivered to her doorstep but she was not made aware of it.\n\nMs Blackman said her mother, who lives in sheltered housing in St Leonards, has mobility issues and uses a zimmer frame, was feeling \"anxious\" and \"panicked\".\n\n\"It was all a bit of a nightmare and she's not in a very good place at the moment,\" Ms Blackman, who lives in Wallington, Surrey, told the PA news agency.\n\n\"She was indoors and they left 12 bottles of water outside her flat door but nobody knocked and she didn't even know it was there.\n\n\"She was taking a cab to the shops and thought that she would take the bottles in when she got back, but six of those had gone missing by the time she got home.\n\nWe all just want it to end and we want to know when the pipe will be fixed and when it's going to be back to normal\n\n\"So she's got six bottles of water now to last however long.\"\n\nMs Blackman added that her mother \"couldn't get to a water station if she needed to\" and \"couldn't carry 12 bottles of water back home\".\n\n\"It's heartbreaking because she's upset and she gets panicked and anxious and I can do absolutely nothing except from reassure her over the phone,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a lot of elderly people around

who has lived in Hastings for 10 years, said his family have 24 two-litre bottles of water which they are having to ration.\n\nI don't blame anyone for the pipe but it's the response afterwards that has been pretty poor, the communication has not been great, and I think they could have done a lot more\n\nHe told PA: \"We have a couple of dogs and a cat as well so they're now included in the rationing.\n\n\"Across the town there's frustration that this has happened, it's not the first time Southern Water has caused problems for Hastings and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.\n\n\"We all just want it to end and we want to know when the pipe will be fixed and when it's going to be back to normal.\"\n\nRob O'Connor, a 47-year-old marketing consultant living in St Leonards, told PA how the water outage has impacted his two children, aged six and 11, as their school was forced to close on Friday.\n\n\"The kids were off school on Friday so there's a certain amount of disruption around that,\" he said.\n\n\"If it has to shut on Tuesday I'll be extremely upset because that's too much disruption.\n\nAs you'd expect we have been working around the clock to not only fix the issue but also do all we can to help our customers, especially those who are vulnerable\n\n\"My 11-year-old has dealt with so much in primary school with the Covid restrictions and this seems like it should be a lot more avoidable.\"\n\nMr O'Connor said that his family were being \"careful\" with their water usage and they have been collecting rain water to flush the toilet.\n\nHe added that he had queued at one of the water collection points for \"an hour\", saying those at the station were doing \"a great job\" but the response from Southern Water had been \"inadequate\".\n\n\"I don't blame anyone for the pipe but it's the response afterwards that has been pretty poor, the communication has not been great, and I think they could have done a lot more,\" he said.\n\nSouthern Water said: \"We are deeply sorry for the mains water pipe burst and the loss of supply so many of our customers in Hastings, St Leonards rural areas around Westfield are experiencing.\n\n\"As you'd expect we have been working around the clock to not only fix the issue but also do all we can to help our customers, especially those who are vulnerable.\n\n\"We're sorry to hear a small number of people are taking water when delivered in this way.\n\n\"We are doing our best to leave in a suitable place wherever possible and understand how upsetting this is.\n\n\"We

We are making good progress on the repair. When the repair work is completed, we will then recharge the network and restart our water supply works. However, this will take time and we expect disruption to continue over the weekend.\"\n\nWater bottle stations have been opened to deliver bottled water to more than 6,000 customers on the company's priority services register. The issue was first reported on Thursday afternoon, forcing schools, a leisure centre and a theatre in the area to close.\n\nSouthern Water added the burst main is located in Keeper's Wood \"deep in woodland\", making it difficult for crews and machinery to reach it. Spokesman Tim McMahon said the burst is in the \"most difficult location\" he has ever seen.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"This burst is in a very, very difficult location, I've been in industry for 20 years, it is by far the most difficult location I've ever seen.

The water supplier said this was because the homes are normally served by the Fairlight reservoir, which was \"not yet sufficiently stocked to meet the demand\".\n\nThere were fears over the weekend that the Jack in the Green, a festival usually held in Hastings that marks the coming of summer, would be severely impacted or cancelled. Despite the rain, the festival went ahead on Monday largely undisrupted.\n\nKeith Leech, the chair of trustees for the event, told the BBC: \"On a Bank Holiday weekend that's absolutely not what the town needs. All the pubs, restaurants and hotels were thinking of having to close, but fortunately on this side of town they've managed to maintain a supply.\n\n\"Hastings being Hastings, we're going to do it regardless of what's going on.\"\n\nSome festivalgoers told the BBC they had been filling up buckets with sea water in order to flush their toilets. The May Day Run, when thousands of motorbikes and scooters descend on the seafront, also went ahead.\n\nSapphyre Callaghan told the BBC she had to close her food shop in Hastings for two days but still had a stall at the Jack in the Green festival. \"We were probably out for three full days, so it was very difficult preparing for Jack in the Green,\" she said. \"Luckily, because we do festivals, we have the facilities to boil water and wash our hands, but by Saturday we decided to close [the shop] because we couldn't cope with the lack of water.\"\n\nTara Flood, a Hastings local who was still without water on Monday, attended the festival. She told the BBC: \"Low pressure last night, but no water this morning. It's an absolute disgrace. We've been up to the water station on Rye Road. The staff working there are just fantastic. We've not been able to flush the toilet for 24 hours. This is not how it should be.\"\n\nSally-Ann Hart, the MP for Hastings and Rye, had told SussexWorld on Thursday that she had spoken to Steve Barclay, the environment secretary, to apply \"pressure on Southern Water get water supply back as a matter of urgency and priority\".\n\nSouthern Water said: \"As areas are being brought back on to supply, Southern Water is redeploying its fleet of 24 tankers to support those areas still without supply. Our bottled water stations will remain open from 8am-9pm and we will continue to deliver bottled water to customers on our priority services register until everyone is confirmed back in supply.\n\n\"Efforts are under way to ensure supplies to enable all primary and secondary schools and colleges in the area to open as normal tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sammy_gecsoyler@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Sammy Gecsoyler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_in_the_Green", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack in the Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Water", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helen's_Wood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Helen's Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hastings United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight,_East_Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fairlight, East Sussex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairlight, East Sussex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helens,_Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Helens, Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Helens, Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day_Run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "May Day Run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Callaghan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Callaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally-Ann_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sally-Ann Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Barclay_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Barclay (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings_and_Rye_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye,_East_Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rye, East Sussex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rye, East Sussex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Water_Gardens", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Water Gardens", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/d82ce108899f83c218ad29777432f0fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537321", "eventUri": "eng-9537321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

residents using bottled water supplied by Southern Water from four collection points around the area, with many rationing their supplies as the issue continues.\n\nIt's quite worrying that a lot of these elderly people will be left with nothing Jakki Blackman\n\nThe company said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the loss of the water supply in the area and that it is delivering bottled water to more than 6,000 customers on its priority services register.\n\nJakki Blackman, 49, said her elderly mother, Christine Lawton, 72, had six of her 12 water bottles \"stolen\" after they were delivered to her doorstep but she was not made aware of it.\n\nMs Blackman said her mother, who lives in sheltered housing in St Leonards, has mobility issues and uses a zimmer frame, was feeling \"anxious\" and \"panicked\".\n\nSome 31,000 properties have been left without water in St Leonards-on-Sea and some areas of Hastings (Nick Ansell/PA)\n\n\"It was all a bit of a nightmare and she's not in a very good place at the moment,\" Ms Blackman, who lives in Wallington, Surrey, told the PA news agency.\n\n\"She was indoors and they left 12 bottles of water outside her flat door but nobody knocked and she didn't even know it was there.\n\n\"She was taking a cab to the shops and thought that she would take the bottles in when she got back, but six of those had gone missing by the time she got home.\n\nWe all just want it to end and we want to know when the pipe will be fixed and when it's going to be back to normal Jon Smalldon\n\n\"So she's got six bottles of water now to last however

she gets panicked and anxious and I can do absolutely nothing except from reassure her over the phone,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a lot of elderly people around there and that's my main concern, those like my mum who don't have relatives very near.\n\n\"It's quite worrying that a lot of these elderly people will be left with nothing.\"\n\nJon Smalldon, 46, who has lived in Hastings for 10 years, said his family have 24 two-litre bottles of water which they are having to ration.\n\nI don't blame anyone for the pipe but it's the response afterwards that has been pretty poor, the communication has not been great, and I think they could have done a lot more Rob O'Connor\n\nHe told PA: \"We have a couple of dogs and a cat as well so they're now included in the rationing.\n\n\"Across the town there's frustration that this has happened, it's not the first time Southern Water has caused problems for Hastings and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.\n\n\"We all just want it to end and we want to know when the pipe will be fixed and when it's going to be back to normal.\"\n\nRob O'Connor, a 47-year-old marketing consultant living in St Leonards, told PA how the water outage has impacted his two children, aged six and 11, as their school was forced to close on Friday.\n\n\"The kids were off school on Friday so there's a certain amount of disruption around that,\" he said.\n\n\"If it has to shut on Tuesday I'll be extremely upset because that's too much disruption.\n\nAs you'd expect we have been working around the clock to not only fix the issue but also do all we can to help our customers, especially those who are vulnerable Southern Water\n\n\"My 11-year-old has dealt with so much in primary school with the Covid restrictions and this seems like it should be a lot more avoidable.\"\n\nMr O'Connor said that his family were being \"careful\" with their water usage and they have been collecting rain water to flush the toilet.\n\nHe added that he had queued at one of the water collection points for \"an hour\", saying those at the station were doing \"a great job\" but the response from Southern Water had been \"inadequate\".\n\n\"I don't blame anyone for the pipe but it's the response afterwards that has been pretty poor, the communication has not been great, and I think they could have done a lot more,\" he said.\n\nSouthern Water said: \"We are deeply sorry for the mains water pipe burst and the loss of supply so many of our customers in Hastings, St Leonards rural areas around Westfield are experiencing.\n\n\"As you'd expect we

but that it would take \"some time\" to restore supply.\n\n\"Once the water has passed stringent quality tests, supplies will start to return for customers,\" it said.\n\nMore than 32,000 properties are without supplies in St Leonards and parts of Hastings, with four bottle stations set up in the towns.\n\nHouseholds and businesses have expressed anger at the length of the outage, coming across the bank holiday weekend when Hastings hosts several busy events.\n\nSouthern Water has said it's \"very sorry\" and teams are delivering water to more than 6,000 vulnerable customers.\n\nHowever, one woman who lives in sheltered accommodation told Sky News her water had been stolen from the car park.\n\n\"People were coming from outside and stopping their cars, running in and grabbing the water and took off,\" said the woman - who didn't give her name.\n\nOther vulnerable customers have said supplies haven't been delivered as promised.\n\nFixing the pipe was tricky because it was in a remote location in dense woodland, according to the water firm - which said people would be compensated in a \"fair and proportionate way\".\n\n\"We're hopeful that water supply could start to return gradually over the course of Sunday with different areas getting water at different times,\" said Southern Water.\n\nAt 9.30am on Sunday, the water firm said it was \"working hard to get our treatment works at Beauport up and running, which it is now, but it will take some time for water supply to return\".\n\nThe outage began on Thursday and forced some schools to close, as well as businesses such as Hastings' White Rock Theatre.\n\nEast Sussex county councillor Godfrey Daniel said the effect on businesses would be \"drastic\" and one hotel was having to flush toilets with seawater.\n\nRead

that was coming through, and now they've managed to completely cut us off from water on the biggest weekend of the year.\"\n\nSouthern Water's finance chief, Stuart Ledger, said the company wasn't currently making a profit and is \"investing everything into the network\".\n\nThe outage comes amid renewed scrutiny on water companies due to recent sewage releases into the sea and rivers, as well

outage", "body": "Residents in East Sussex have expressed their \"frustration\" after some 31,000 properties have been left without water.\n\nSouthern Water said the disruption in St Leonards-on-Sea and some areas of Hastings, due to a burst water main, started on Thursday and is expected to continue into Sunday.\n\nThe water outage has left residents using bottled water supplied by Southern Water from four collection points around the area, with many rationing their supplies as the issue continues.\n\nThe company said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the loss of the water supply in the area and that it is delivering bottled water to more than 6,000 customers on its priority services register.\n\nJakki Blackman, 49, said her elderly mother, Christine Lawton, 72, had six of her 12 water bottles \"stolen\" after they were delivered to her doorstep but she was not made aware of it.\n\nMs Blackman said her mother, who lives in sheltered housing in St Leonards, has mobility issues and uses a zimmer frame, was feeling \"anxious\" and \"panicked\".\n\n\"It was all a bit of a nightmare and she's not in a very good place at the moment,\" Ms Blackman, who lives in Wallington, Surrey, told the PA news agency.\n\n\"She was indoors and they left 12 bottles of water outside her flat door but nobody knocked and she didn't even know it was there.\n\n\"She was taking a cab to the shops and thought that she would take the bottles in when she got back, but six of those had gone missing by the time she got home.\n\n\"So she's got six bottles of water now to last however long.\"\n\nMs Blackman added that her mother \"couldn't get to a water station if she needed to\" and \"couldn't carry 12 bottles of water back home\".\n\n\"It's heartbreaking because she's upset and she gets panicked and anxious and I can do absolutely nothing except from reassure her over the phone,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a lot of elderly people around there and that's my main concern, those like my mum who don't have relatives very near.\n\n\"It's quite worrying that a lot of these elderly people will be left with nothing.\"\n\nJon Smalldon, 46, who has lived in Hastings for 10 years, said his family have 24 two-litre bottles of water which they are having to ration.\n\nHe told PA: \"We have a couple of dogs and a cat as well so they're now included in the rationing.\n\n\"Across the town there's frustration that this has happened, it's not the first time Southern Water has caused problems for Hastings and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.\n\n\"We all just want it to end and we want to know when the pipe will be fixed and when it's going to be back to normal.\"\n\nRob O'Connor, a 47-year-old marketing consultant living in St Leonards, told PA how the water outage has impacted his two children, aged six and 11, as their school was forced to close on Friday.\n\n\"The kids were off school on Friday so there's a certain amount of disruption around that,\" he said.\n\n\"If it has to shut on Tuesday I'll be extremely upset because that's too much disruption.\n\n\"My 11-year-old has dealt with so much in primary school with the Covid restrictions and this seems like it should be a lot more avoidable.\"\n\nMr O'Connor said that his family were being \"careful\" with their water usage and they have been collecting rain water to flush the toilet.\n\nHe added that he had queued at one of the water collection points for \"an hour\", saying those at the station were doing \"a great job\" but the response from Southern Water had been \"inadequate\".\n\n\"I don't blame anyone for the pipe but it's the response afterwards that has been pretty poor, the communication has not been great, and I think they could have done a lot more,\" he said.\n\nSouthern Water said: \"We are deeply sorry for the mains water pipe burst and the loss of supply so many of our customers in Hastings, St Leonards rural areas around Westfield are experiencing.\n\n\"As you'd expect we have been working around the clock to not only fix the issue but also do all we can to help our customers, especially those who are vulnerable.\n\n\"We're sorry to hear a small number of people are taking water when delivered in this way.\n\n\"We are doing our best to leave in a suitable place wherever possible and understand how upsetting this is.\n\n\"We have added these people to our lists again, and will continue with deliveries until this incident is fixed and supply restored.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

There should also be deliveries to the elderly and disabled on a priority list.\n\nSome locals have turned to creative ways around the shortage. Author Paul Burston, who lives in a flat in Hastings, said: \"I've seen people going down to the sea with buckets to flush their toilet.\"\n\nHe added: \"There's an elderly man in the flat beneath me. English isn't his first language and he was very distressed. He was calling his daughter to try and collect him. I get notifications on my phone [from Southern Water] but he originally thought the water was turned off in just his flat.\n\n\"I don't blame Southern Water for the pipe but there wasn't a back-up.\n\n\"Thousands of people have been without water for four days now. I don't think the back-up was very well organised.\"\n\nDescribing how the traditional bank holiday weekend crowds have been reduced by the outage, Mr Burston said: \"Every year you would wake up and hear the bikers. Usually, the roads are gridlocked but yesterday the roads were empty.\"\n\nSouthern Water announced on Sunday it would be offering compensation to businesses affected by the disruption over the busy weekend.\n\nPaul Oxborrow, the owner of St Benedict B&B in St Leonards, said he has lost business as a result of the water shortage despite staying open.\n\nHe said: \"We've had people cancel - three or four bookings - but mostly people have come... People want to have showers and flush the toilet. I mean the reason why [people] have cancelled is because they want to have water in their bathrooms.\"\n\nAsked whether he would be eligible for the compensation, Mr Oxborrow said: \"I gather so. If it's not too difficult to apply then I will, but I don't know how.\"\n\nTourism in the area has suffered this weekend as a result of the disruption.

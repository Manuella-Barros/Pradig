Three players in Kusal Janith Perera, Pramod Madushan and Jeffrey Vandersay have been added to the Sri Lanka ODI squad as standbys.\n\nMadushanka suffered a Grade 2, left hamstring injury during a fielding practice session while Pathirana has suffered a mild sprain on his right shoulder while diving to take a catch during the third T20I on July 30 at Kandy said Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in a media release.\n\nShiraz has an impressive List A record with 80 wickets to his name in 47 games at a miserly economy of 4.57. The 23-year-old Malinga debuted in July 2022, with 12 wickets in seven games at an economy rate of 5.80. The uncapped duo would look to seize this opportunity against India, and make a claim to push them higher in the selection pecking order with Sri Lanka having been regularly plagued with injuries in the fast bowling front in the recent past.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheesha_Pathirana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matheesha Pathirana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilshan_Madushanka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dilshan Madushanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuwan_Thushara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuwan Thushara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Shiraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Shiraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushmantha_Chameera", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushmantha Chameera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramod_Madushan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pramod Madushan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Vandersay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Vandersay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusal_Perera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kusal Perera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.cricbuzz.comhttps://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/600x400/i1/c534582/pathirana-injured-his-shoulder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781504", "eventUri": "eng-9781504", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 127, "textEnd": 136}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 731, "textEnd": 738}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The hosts, who went down in the T20I series, have lost the services of Dilshan Madushanka and Matheesha Pathirana for the ODI matches starting on Friday.\n\nHaving already lost Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Thushara to injuries before the start of the T20I series, this comes as a big blow. Meanwhile, uncapped pacers Mohamed Shiraz and Eshan Malinga have been drafted into the ODI squad as replacements. Apart from this, three more players Kusal Janith Perera, Pramod Madushan and Jeffrey Vandersay have been added to the squad as standbys.\n\nWhile Madushanka suffered a grade 2 left hamstring injury during a fielding practice session, Pathiranagot a mild sprain on his right shoulder while trying to take a catch during the third and final T20I match against India. It will be quite difficult for the island nation to pull off in the 50-over series due to the lack of experience in their team.\n\nShiraz has an impressive List A record with 80 wickets in his kitty in 47 games at an economy rate of 4.57. Malinga, meanwhile, debuted in July 2022 and has taken 12 wickets in seven matches at an economy rate of 5.80.

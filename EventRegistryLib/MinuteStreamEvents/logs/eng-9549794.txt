The fame Reese and the other high-profile rookies have, and the perks it affords them, are byproducts of the nearly three decades women like Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi and Reese's own coach, Teresa Weatherspoon, have put into growing interest in the league and women's basketball.\n\nWhen Reese goes to an event like Monday night's Met Gala, she carries all of those women with her.\n\n\"The people that have played before me (and) a lot of the great players already in the league, they deserve this,\" Reese said Tuesday night, ahead of the Chicago Sky's home preseason game. \"Being able to give them the publicity, because you always got to give your flowers to the ones that came before you ... they've been deserving of this for a really long time.\"\n\nReese arrived in Chicago with her celebrity status, on and off the court, already firmly intact. She'd won a national championship as a junior at LSU, and her taunting of Clark after the game helped send interest in the game skyrocketing.\n\nShe has 3 million-plus followers on Instagram and announced her decision to turn pro in an interview with Vogue. As if any further proof of her crossover status was needed, she was only the second WNBA player to earn a coveted invite to the Met Gala. Brittney Griner was the first, attending last year with wife Cherelle.\n\nWearing a dress made for her by British designer 16Arlington, Reese spent the night of her 22nd birthday with a Who's Who of A-listers - Cardi B posted videos of the two of them together - before returning to Chicago in time for Tuesday morning's shootaround.\n\n\"There was no way we as an organization were going to take that away from her,\" Weatherspoon said. \"It's a big thing. When you're called and asked to be a part of that? You better get your nice little outfit on and go. Get out of here and enjoy the moment because your name was called for a certain reason. You represent yourself well in what you do. They wouldn't call you otherwise.\n\n\"This is something she earned,\" Weatherspoon added. \"And we're just excited about what she's going to continue to earn.\"\n\nAnd therein lies the crux of it. By taking advantage of these opportunities and growing her own spotlight, Reese shines it on everyone in the game.\n\n\"Next year, I want another rookie to go (to the Met Gala). I want women's basketball players to be there. We deserve a spot,\" Reese said. \"So many people were yelling from the street, calling my name, calling me, 'Bayou Barbie,' 'Chi-Town Barbie.' It was cool just to be able to see I don't just impact people on the court but off the court as well.\"\n\nThat impact is already being felt in Chicago.\n\nThis is a fanbase reeling from the Sky's inability to hang onto the team that won the title in 2021. But Reese has given them hope again. Her jerseys were sold out on the Sky's online store within days of her being drafted. Tuesday night's game was limited to season-ticket holders -- and new Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams and fellow first-round pick Rome Odunze -- and there were enough of them to fill most of the lower bowl at Wintrust Arena.\n\n\"It's huge,\" Courtney Vandersloot, a starter on that Sky championship team before signing with the Liberty as a free agent last season, said of the importance to the WNBA of having a rejuvenated Chicago team.\n\n\"They're going to pack this house and it's going to be a great place, and they're going to have eyes on them everywhere they go,\" Vandersloot added. \"It's all about growing the game and growing the league, and they're going to be at the forefront of that.\"\n\nEvery time Reese scored or made a big defensive play, the crowd cheered and threw their fists into the air. When she made a driving layup over Jonquel Jones and drew a foul, the roar drowned out the P.A. announcer's cry of \"Chi-town Barbie!\"\n\nReese finished with 13 points, five rebounds and two steals in the Sky's 101-53 rout of the New York Liberty.\n\nWhether these folks were WNBA fans before this season or not is irrelevant. They're invested now. In Reese, in the Sky and, by extension, the rest of the league. That's how you build on progress. That's how you take momentum and turn it into sustained growth.\n\nThat's how you pay back all those women who came before you.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: WNBA players have long deserved attention.

She then traveled back to Chicago on a private plane and scored 13 points in 19 minutes in Tuesday's 101-53 preseason victory over the New York Liberty -- played before only the Sky's season-ticket holders and several prominent athletes, including new Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\n\"I took my matchup seriously, I watched film when I was on the plane and I didn't take anything off,\" Reese said Wednesday during the team's media day. \"I wanted to get back. People at the Met Gala were like, 'Are you partying after this?' I'm like, 'No, I've got a game tomorrow. I gotta watch film.' I prioritize everything. I'm still in school as well, so I've got a busy schedule -- a lot going on -- but like I said, you've got to maximize your 24 hours.\"\n\nReese recognizes her own profile and those of other WNBA rookies, including the Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark and Sky teammate Kamilla Cardoso, will create more buzz at games this season.\n\n\"The who's who are going to be courtside,\" Reese said. \"I was at the Met Gala, and Usher's going to try to come up to a game in Vegas and Cardi B. I know some people that y'all might not think I know.\"\n\nReese expects big crowds both for home and away games as interest grows around the sport. She also praised the WNBA's decision this week to begin funding full-time charter flight service for teams during the season.\n\n\"Games are going to be packed,\" Reese said. \"Standing-room only sometimes. We might get those. They just told us when I go back home to Washington, we're playing where the Wizards play. So the change is happening and it's not going to stop here. We're in a great direction with the charter flights. Being able to have that, that's a step in the right direction.\n\n\"The [collective bargaining agreement] stuff is about to happen within the next year, too, so just understanding the gravitation we have, everything is in our hands right now to control.\"\n\nReese, who took a private plane to the Met Gala after getting permission from coach Teresa Weatherspoon to leave Monday's practice, is having a dramatically different rookie experience than some of her veteran teammates. Sky center Elizabeth Williams, selected No. 4 overall in the 2015 draft, recalled sharing hotel rooms during her first few seasons in the league and taking commercial flights between games.\n\nWilliams said years of advocacy from the WNBPA and developments like name, image and likeness in the college game have led to some key improvements. She said players with large fan followings, like Reese, have \"a spotlight on her that none of us have,\" and need added layers of protection when traveling.\n\n\"We're finally seeing the benefits of the fact that Angel's playing in a national championship game on ABC or ESPN,\" Williams said. \"All of that adds up. At the end of the day, this is what we want. I'm grateful to be a part of a league that sees that vision and sees that growth. Hopefully now that we've been screaming it from the rooftops, investors understand that and companies understand that.\"\n\nReese called Chicago the \"perfect place\" to start her pro career and noted her connection with Weatherspoon, a Hall of Fame player and five-time WNBA All-Star who reminds Reese in ways of her coach at LSU, Kim Mulkey.\n\nWeatherspoon praised Reese for \"maximizing everything she's earning\" both with her celebrity status but also in basketball.\n\nThe Sky open the season May 15 at Dallas.\n\n\"When I was talking to teams during the draft process, I knew I wanted to come to Chicago immediately,\" Reese said. \"I felt understood, I felt loved. [Weatherspoon] didn't know me, I didn't know her, but we had a conversation on the phone where I felt like she was a mom. I knew I will always be good with her and she will always be there for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Reese showed off her skills in a dominant match against the New York Liberty, helping her team win 101-53 and facing off against reigning WNBA MVP Breanna Stewart.\n\nReese, who was selected seventh overall in the 2024 WNBA Draft, lived up to all the pre-season excitement with an impressive performance. She contributed 13 points, shooting 6-of-10 from the field. Reese also secured five rebounds and two steals, demonstrating her versatility on the court.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of Reese's game was her composure when facing off against experienced veterans like Breanna Stewart. Reese didn't back down from the challenge; instead, she displayed her aggressiveness and skills in the paint. One such example is from the video below:\n\nIn the absence of fellow rookie Kamilla Cardoso, who is sidelined due to a shoulder injury, the Sky relied heavily on Reese's energy and determination. Though it's only preseason, Reese's standout performances have ignited a wave of excitement among fans.\n\nAngel Reese settling well at the WNBA level against expectations\n\nEntering the WNBA preseason as the Chicago Sky's prized rookie, Angel Reese faced high expectations. Living up to such hype can be intimidating, yet Reese appears to be handling it with ease.\n\nThrough a couple of preseason games, \"Bayou Barbie, aka Angel Reese,\" has captured attention not only for her natural talent but also for her quick adaptation to the professional game.\n\nSo far, Reese has exceeded expectations, averaging a solid 13.0 points per game with an impressive 44% shooting from the field. However, her influence extends beyond scoring. Reese's relentless energy on the boards, grabbing an average of 7.0 rebounds per game, and her defensive hustle, demonstrated by her 2.0 steals per game, have become defining aspects of her playstyle.\n\nThe WNBA community is abuzz with the arrival of Angel Reese.

Being able to be so impactful in this world is crazy and amazing.\"\n\n'Maximize your 24 hours'\n\nWhile the impact of anything Reese does bears weight -- The rookie basketball star has nearly seven million followers combined across Instagram, TikTok, X and Facebook -- Internet critics have speculated on a lack of work ethic and dedication to the game of basketball from the former NCAA national champion, which she indirectly addressed Tuesday.\n\n\"Maximize your 24 hours, being able to set a schedule. I know what I was going to do from the beginning of the day to the end,\" Reese said. \"I have an amazing team. My coaches being able to allow me to go to something like [the Met Gala]. Obviously, I come to practice because that's my priority here and what has gotten me to where I am today, which is basketball.\n\n\"I have an amazing team outside of there. So, I come to practice, I have my schedule and everything ready in the morning and then it's just being able to do both things.\"\n\nAfter a day of dashing to the hoop by morning, and fueling fashion discourse by night, Reese and her teammates beat the brakes off the reigning Eastern Conference champion New York Liberty, 101-53, in a preseason matchup highlighted by Reese going straight into the chest of two-time WNBA MVP and champion Breanna Stewart.\n\nReese wound up finishing the game with 13 points, five rebounds and two steals on 6/10 shooting with a +/- of +32.\n\n\"This team is so much fun, there's so many different personalities on the team. I love that for us,\" Reese said before the game Tuesday. \"Being able to have a coaching staff that is so open and understanding of who you are. [Head Coach Teresa Witherspoon] literally works me out so, that really is some of the relationship I love to have.\n\n\"And just being in Chicago, they've always embraced me, the culture here is amazing.\"\n\nDespite being in the city for less than a month, Reese has already acclimated well to the city.\n\nLast week, Reese adventured to a Chicago staple, Harold's Chicken, and was so impressed, she said their food was \"bussin'\" and declared Harold's as her new favorite chicken spot in Chicago.\n\n\"Harold's Chicken is bussin'. I ain't going to lie to you,\" Reese said. \"In Baltimore, we've got Hip-Hop Chicken. Harold's Chicken here, we've got Blue Store in [Baton Rouge] -- I'm just trying to see which one is the best one.\"\n\nReese, a native of Randallstown in the northern suburbs of Baltimore, ultimately conceded Hip-Hop Chicken reigns supreme in her opinion, but when looking at the wider world of sports culture in Chicago, she sees little difference between her hometown, college town and pro sports town.\n\nThey all have, and will continue to be, environments that foster a supportive environment where athletes across the spectrum of sports can thrive.\n\n\"No it's the same thing. Everything is popping. All these sports are popping,\" Reese said. \"It's not just women's basketball. It's not just football. Everything in the city [is] popping ... I just love that for us all, being able to support each other in so many different sports, it's cool and I love sports. I'm gonna be going to all the games, all different kinds of sports so, I'm excited for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Former Iowa star and No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark has helped grow women's basketball immensely over the last two seasons, but so many others have contributed to the recent success of the sport. That includes former LSU standout and current Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese.\n\nReese scored 13 points and grabbed five rebounds in 19 minutes in the Sky's 101-53 victory over the New York Liberty in Tuesday's preseason game. That performance came just one day after attending the Met Gala.\n\nFollowing that performance, Reese said she talked to some high-profile stars while attending the Met Gala. She's optimistic that some of the biggest names in entertainment are going to start showing up at WNBA games, helping to grow the sport.\n\n\"The who's who are going to be courtside,\" Reese said, per ESPN. \"I was at the Met Gala, and Usher's going to try to come up to a game in Vegas and Cardi B. I know some people that y'all might not think I know.\"\n\nChicago is in a particularly good spot with Reese, who was one of the most popular women's college players over the last two years. She's also teamed up with former South Carolina star Kamilla Cardoso -- although the 6-foot-7 suffered a shoulder injury that will keep her sidelined for four to six weeks.\n\n\"Games are going to be packed,\" Reese said. \"Standing-room only sometimes. We might get those. They just told us when I go back home to Washington, we're playing where the Wizards play. So the change is happening and it's not going to stop here. We're in a great direction with the charter flights. Being able to have that, that's a step in the right direction.\n\n\"The [collective bargaining agreement] stuff is about to happen within the next year, too, so just understanding the gravitation we have, everything is in our hands right now to control.\"\n\nWith stars like Clark, Reese and Cardoso coming into the league, there's a lot of excitement surrounding the start of the 2024 season. It's going to be fun to follow along and see just how much the WNBA grows throughout the course of the year.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing-room_only", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standing-room only"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2579,h_1450,x_0,y_8/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastbreak/01hxfbxq0jffkj6g59dc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

'It's what I do'", "body": "On Monday, her 22nd birthday, the Chicago Sky rookie made an unusual trip after practice in suburban Deerfield.\n\nTypically when people leave the Sachs Center, a park district health club in a strip mall, they might get some ramen at Jimmy Thai or a coffee at Dunkin' Donuts. If they really feel like ruining their workout, they go across the street to Portillo's.\n\nReese, who is a bit different than the average player, rookie or not, went to the Met Gala.\n\nReese rocked a custom dress from British label 16Arlington, enjoyed the night among the glitterati and then flew back to Chicago to be ready to put in some work Tuesday. She scored 13 points and added five rebounds in 19 minutes as the Sky blew out the New York Liberty in a 101-53 preseason victory.\n\n\"I went to the Met Gala, slayed the Met Gala in New York, came back, slayed against New York,\" she said. \"It's what I do.\"\n\n\"Angel is unique,\" DeShields said. \"She's incredibly unique. I think that is really cool that she got that opportunity to go to the Met Gala. I mean, I'm still waiting on my invite.\"\n\nAnd for a meaningless preseason game, the Sky -- who aren't expected to be anything close to contenders and will be missing their top draft pick Kamilla Cardoso for four to six weeks because of a shoulder injury -- legitimately had Chicago buzzing.\n\nReese has lent the team her shine. While No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark is the undisputed leader in WNBA rookie celebrity -- she killed on Saturday Night Live before the draft -- Reese is no slouch. It's not why they drafted her No. 7 overall -- she's a ferocious rebounder and skilled inside scorer -- but it doesn't hurt to have some star power for a team looking for its share of the attention economy in a crowded market. The Sky were led by hometown legend Candace Parker when they lit up the city and won the WNBA title in 2021, but that glow quickly faded.\n\nNow, it's a new team and a new time. It's Reese's time.\n\nOn Tuesday, her viral trip to New York added some intrigue -- How would she play? -- and then Chicago Bears Caleb Williams, Rome Odunze and Keenan Allen showed up and sat courtside, making a game otherwise only open to season ticket holders a scene.\n\nChicago athletes showing up to Sky games is normal -- Williams, as the Bears' No. 1 pick, adds a little extra pop to wherever he goes -- but Reese, who is always thinking big, predicts this will be a recurring story here and on the road.\n\n\"Everybody is going to be courtside,\" she said. \"The celebrities are going to be courtside. Just know, the who's who's is going to be courtside. I was at the Met Gala and Usher (said he) is going to try to come up to a game in Vegas, and Cardi B. I know some people that y'all might not think I know, but I know.\"\n\nThe big news in the league right now is the surprise announcement from commissioner Cathy Engelbert (seriously, even the teams didn't know it was coming) that the WNBA will start traveling on chartered flights. The money is coming, and it's time for the WNBA to invest in its game. No more travel delays that wipe out a day off.\n\nA private plane, of course, is how Reese got to New York so quickly. Again, she's different.\n\n\"I did all my hair and makeup on the plane,\" she said. \"Both of my girls and one of my friends got on the plane with me. We're doing hair and makeup on a plane, blow drying and flat ironing, which is crazy, but it turned out great, as you can see.\"\n\nWith young celebrities like Reese and Clark in the league and the attention they bring, perhaps that's one reason why the WNBA is finally acting on the players' long-held request for chartered flights.\n\n\"I am glad that the league was proactive,\" veteran Sky forward Elizabeth Williams said. \"We're in a time where, I mean, Angel has 3 million followers. She has a spotlight on her that none of us have and we don't have anything to compare it to. And rather than having an incident occur, I think this is a proactive take.\"\n\nAfter all that hoopla, Reese said that if she had a bad game against the Liberty, she would've heard her ex-coach at LSU, the forever-piqued Kim Mulkey, in her head, if not her current Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon. So she made sure she was ready to play, even if it was just a preseason game. Reese could make a serious living as a social media influencer, but this is her career.\n\n\"I already knew the expectations going into it, like I needed to be locked in and focused on my matchups,\" she said. \"I took my matchups seriously. I watched film when I was on the plane. I wanted to get back. People at the Met Gala were like, 'Are you partying after this?' I said, no, I got a game tomorrow. I gotta watch film. I prioritize everything. I'm still in school as well, so I got a busy schedule of a lot going on. But like I said, you've got to maximize your 24 hours.\"\n\nWeatherspoon, one of the greatest women's basketball players of all time, hasn't coached a real WNBA game yet, but she's obviously comfortable enough to let her players be themselves. It bodes well for her as she shepherds a mostly new roster with limited outside expectations of winning.\n\nAs for Reese's trip, she loved it. Weatherspoon said Reese, \"earned that opportunity to go and me as her head coach, I'm not going to take that away from her.\"\n\n\"How did I know I could trust Angel Reese?\" she said. \"Angel does angelic stuff, so I know that she understands how to prioritize.\"\n\nAt the Sky's media day Wednesday, Reese talked about the duality of her life and her image on and off the court.\n\n\"I always felt like I wanted to be the cute, pretty girl on the court, but I wanted to also be a dog and have that dog mentality,\" she said. \"So I want to continue to let women understand and know, like, you can do both.\"\n\nThe idea that women's basketball players peak in college is foolish. At 22, Reese's career and life are just beginning. Her WNBA career hasn't started yet, but it's fair to expect that we will be talking about her for a long time.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"},

I knew I would always be good with her and she would always be there for me through everything.\"\n\nReese, the No. 7 overall pick in April's WNBA Draft, scored 13 points in each of her first two preseason games for the Sky.\n\nShe added five rebounds and two steals during Chicago's most recent preseason matchup against the New York Liberty.\n\nThe Chicago Sky will open up the regular season on the road next week (May 15th) against the Dallas Wings.\n\nTipoff is set at 8:00 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_flynn@postandcourier.com", "name": "Cameron Flynn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Academy of Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/4c/f4c2e46a-3013-5489-9ebb-176cf80aff30/663d42a63d288.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C77&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1578, "textEnd": 1586}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Wintertrust Arena was bursting with supporters who couldn't wait to watch the self-proclaimed \"Chi Barbie\" suit up for coach Teresa Weatherspoon. Reese already showed a glimpse of her stuff on Friday in Minnesota but many more were thrilled to see her in Windy City.\n\nWhile Reese did show up and prove that she was as good as advertised, there was one presence that caught some by surprise. Kysre Gondrezick, the former Indiana Fever guard, came off the bench to help the Sky pummel the highly-touted visitors. She was on the floor for roughly 13 minutes and dazzled with 3-for-4 shooting from deep.\n\nDuring the game, a photo of Angel Reese holding the hand of a smiling Gondrezick quickly went viral. Reese reacted to it, showing hope that the backup guard could get a spot on the roster:\n\nKysre Gondrezick re-posted the tweet and captioned it with:\n\n\"This means everything to me @Reese10Angel\"\n\nBefore Angel Reese turned pro, Gondrezick had already signed a one-year $60,471 camp contract deal in February 2024. The Sky did the same back in 2022 but waived her just before the regular season started. If things don't work out, she could be on that route once again in 2024.\n\nEvery WNBA team can sign up to 18 players but only 11-12 will be on the roster for the season. While Reese is guaranteed to be one of the franchise leaders, Gondrezick's tenure is still on the bubble.\n\nAngel Reese's clout might not be enough to let Kysre Gondrezick stay\n\nAlthough she is still a rookie, the Chicago Sky know what they have with Angel Reese. Already they are one of the most exciting teams in the league following Reese and Kamilla Cardoso's arrival. The \"Chi Barbie,\" seems to have some clout already before playing a minute in the regular season.\n\nBut, Teresa Weatherspoon will pick whoever she thinks is the best among the group. Kysre Gondrezick had a poor outing in Minnesota before bouncing back nicely in Chicago. Marina Mabrey, Dana Evans and Lindsay Allen are likely the top three guards in the rotation. Gondrezick will be competing with Chennedy Carter for what might be a fourth guard on the roster.\n\nIt remains to be seen how things will play out as Weatherspoon still has some tough decisions to make. Regardless of what will happen, Kysre Gondrezick is already grateful for the opportunity to play with Angel Reese.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kysre_Gondrezick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kysre Gondrezick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Evans_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana Evans (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsay Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/a00a0-17151764215021-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Reese contributed 13 points on 60 percent shooting and five rebounds in the win. Chicago limited New York star Sabrina Ionescu to eight points.\n\nThat was just the icing on the cake. On Monday, which was her birthday, the forward made a statement on X:\n\nReese started her day at training camp with the Sky, where the team sang the Stevie Wonder rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" and gifted her a basket full of snacks.\n\nFive days before Reese's birthday, she expressed on social media that she couldn't believe she'd be turning 22 and teased a \"big surprise.\"\n\nThat surprise was Reese's appearance at the Met Gala in New York City.\n\nIn her debut, she ripped the red carpet with a custom mint-green dress designed by British clothing brand 16Arlington. The dress featured a floor-length sheer skirt, feathers around the waist and a long, sparkly V-neck.\n\nWNBA players seldom walk the stairs at the Met Gala as the event typically takes place during the season. Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner attended in 2023, but Reese was the only WNBA player at this year's event.\n\nReese was seen on rapper Cardi B's Instagram story, reciting the lyrics to her hit song \"WAP,\" where she referenced Reese and the LSU basketball team.\n\nReese has long held an interest in the fashion world. She declared for the WNBA draft with a photoshoot featured in Vogue Magazine and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit in May 2023.\n\n\"Wow! God is so good!

She's perhaps the biggest prospect the league has seen behind Caitlin Clark and so far, she's not running away from any challenge.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orlando_silva@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Orlando Silva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Lynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Lynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23034280-1715189842.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

She wasn't going to be ready for the regular season.\n\nTurns out, she was just fine. The bright lights couldn't outshine Reese.\n\n\"I went to the Mag Gala, slayed the Mag Gala in New York,\" Reese said. \"Came back, slayed against New York.\"\n\n\"It's what I do.\"\n\nReese, Kamilla Cardoso and Brynna Maxwell make up the three-player draft class for the Sky in 2024. They're also a part of an incoming class that's revolutionized women's college basketball.\n\nThat energy has continued over to the WNBA. The Sky had Chicago Bears' Caleb Williams, Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze, as well as Chicago Bulls guard Coby White, present at their preseason game Tuesday.\n\nWilliams, White, Blackhawks center Connor Bedard and Cubs pitcher Sh\u014dta Imanaga are a few of the new names on the Chicago block this past year. Reese, Cardoso and Maxwell fit perfectly in this new landscape.\n\n\"I mean, it's a preseason game. No one forces anybody to do anything. Now that was their choice,\" Sky general manager Jeff Pagliocca said. \"I've heard from a lot of my ex-NBA clients about wanting to come and see games. It's an exciting time in the WNBA. It's not just here, it's everywhere.\"\n\nEverywhere also includes Chicago, now.\n\nThe Sky didn't draft Reese for her personal brand. But, it's impossible to ignore. She has over 3 million followers on Instagram and won a national title in college. Cardoso is coming off a national title herself, her second in three years.\n\n\"With players that we drafted, they have a lot of attention, and at the time we just were looking for some size and athleticism and we were looking for a difference maker on the boards at the same time,\" Pagliocca said. \"We got a lot more as far as eyes on us and excitement and those guys coming out last night.\n\nCardoso fits Chicago with her strength. She talked about her mental and physical fortitude on Wednesday, which is crucial to thrive in a city like Chicago.\n\nLesser athletes have tried and failed.\n\nCardoso is already facing adversity with a shoulder injury that will keep her out 4 to 6 weeks. Any struggle was not seen on her face. She's prepared to handle recovery and stardom.\n\n\"I'm a really strong person,\" Cardoso said. \"I've been through a lot and now I got here, I got hurt and yeah, just that I'm a really strong person and I'm very proud of myself.\n\nThe star power Cardoso and Reese bring rivals that of Williams with the Bears and is something the Sky last saw when they signed Candace Parker.\n\nThe difference is the Sky did this on their own accord, seeking out players that could improve their team. Those players just happened to be college players with two of the biggest profiles.\n\nThe Sky came into the offseason without a first-round pick. Come draft day, through various trades, they have two in the top seven.\n\nIn picking Cardoso and Reese, the team set up its future. In picking a player like Maxwell, a sharpshooter from Gonzaga, the team picked an identity.\n\nPagliocca said Maxwell said one of her first days with the team that no one on the roster will out-work her. She even tried to work through a knee injury that's sidelining her for three to four weeks.\n\nOther Chicago stars have shared Maxwell's mentality.\n\n\"I mean, we're kind of infusing something a little bit different into the city that maybe wasn't expected,\" Pagliocca said. \"We're riding the wave right now, just going to keep getting better every day.\"\n\nReese, the seventh overall pick, already has a personal connection to the Chicago sports landscape.\n\nReese hails from the Washington D.C. area and knows Williams, who is also from the greater D.C. area. Reese said she and Williams have already talked about the potential of what they can do in Chicago.\n\n\"It's so much fun,\" Reese said. \"Obviously, I know Caleb from back home and having those kinds of conversations, talking about how we can turn the city up and do so many great things while we're here, and it's just great being able to bring that winning culture back to Chicago and all sports, not just, not just the football like everybody and baseball as well.\n\nReese has captured that success before. Embracing a city is something Reese has done as a player.\n\nShe transferred from Maryland to LSU, bringing a national title to Baton Rouge.\n\n\"Just being able to have a city that's winning and everything and knowing everybody loves you from all different kinds of sides,\" Reese said. \"Being able to just come together as a community for the right thing is something that I've always emphasized.\"\n\nBridging the gap between her identities on the court and off the court will be something she can bring to Chicago.\n\n\"Everybody's gonna be court side, the celebrities gonna be court side,\" Reese said. \"I was just talking, I was at the Met Gala and Usher is going to try to come up to a game in Vegas and Cardi B.\"\n\nIt was a fun moment. It also serves as an example for how Reese's influence and potential can go hand in hand.\n\n\"I know some people that y'all might not think I know, but I know,\" Reese said.", "source": {"uri":

This year's event was no different, with some of the biggest names in entertainment and sports attending, including WNBA Rookie Angel Reese attending.\n\nAfter an NCAA title last year and entering the WNBA draft this year, many took note of Reese's attendance.\n\nThis year's list of attendees, apart from Angel Reese, included tennis legend Serena Williams and popular star Naomi Osaka. Moreover, NFL legend Tom Brady attended and F1 standout Lewis Hamilton.\n\nThe NBA was also represented during the evening's festivities, with former MVP Russell Westbrook in attendance, as well as Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade. As is customary with the Met Gala, images of various celebrities in attendance were quick to circulate online.\n\nAngel Reese took to Instagram to share photos of herself at the event, while indicating that her attendance also served as her 22nd birthday present. The Chicago Sky rookie caught the attention of US tennis standout Coco Gauff, who has continued to impress on court as a top-ranked WTA player.\n\nReese posted about the event:\n\n\"22nd birthday at the MET GALA?! I think YES. Thank you to Anna Wintour & @instagram for inviting me to this amazing event!\"\n\nIn response, Gauff wrote a two-word message accompanied by an emoji with heart eyes.\n\nAngel Reese's Met Gala appearance came just hours after preseason win over Liberty\n\nWhile Angel Reese's appearance at the Met Gala served as a celebration of sorts for her 22nd birthday, she and the Sky also picked up a win earlier in the day. The team competed against the New York Liberty in their final preseason game, picking up a monstrous 101-53 win.\n\nThe game saw Reese log 19 minutes, contributing 13 points and five rebounds. In addition, she also added two steals, to the team's total, which saw the Sky collectively record 13 steals.\n\nWhile final roster cuts are expected to be handled on May 13, Reese's play and star power seem to have secured her a spot on the final roster. Between her impressive outing in the Sky's final preseason game and her impressive play in college, Reese is likely to make the final cut.\n\nShould she wind up making it past the final round of cuts, as expected, she will look to make a mark in the regular season, which begins on May 14. Reese and the Sky play their first regular season game on May 15 against the Dallas Wings.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The new city has her feeling at home already, dubbing her 'Chi-Town Barbie,' and she expects a bunch of celebrities to come and watch their games in the 2024 WNBA season.\n\nThe Chicago Sky just held their media day, where Angel Reese was asked by the media if she expects the renewed interest in women's basketball will drive celebrities to come and watch at courtside.\n\nHaving attended the 2024 Met Gala, the 6-foot-3 forward got to talk to a bunch of celebrities and confirmed that stars like Cardi B and Usher are interested in watching a WNBA game.\n\n\"Courtside, everybody 'gone be courtside. The celebrities 'gone be courtside. I was just talking-- I was at the Met Gala and Usher going to try come up to a game-- and Cardi B.\"\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Usher is valued at $260 million, while Cardi B is at $80 million. The latter has been attending NBA games and is an avid basketball fan.\n\nIn a separate interview, Reese also confirmed this, saying that Cardi B should see a Sky game when they visit New York, while Usher should watch when Chicago battles Las Vegas.\n\nAngel Reese dreams of Michael Jordan coming to watch a Chicago Sky game\n\nNow that Chicago is the new home of Angel Reese, she has one wish in particular: she hopes six-time NBA champion and Bulls legend Michael Jordan comes and attends one of the Chicago Sky's games.\n\n\"I want Michael Jordan to come to a game,\" Reese said. \"I don't know if I've ever seen him at a women's basketball game. So, I want him to come to a game. Yeah, that's really the person I really want.\n\n\"Obviously, being in Chicago and everything he's done for the Chicago Bulls that would be really cool to see.\"\n\nThe two preseason games of the Sky are now over and they will turn their focus to opening night. Angel Reese played center in their most recent tuneup against the New York Liberty, where she logged in 18 minutes and provided 13 points, five rebounds, and one block.\n\nThe Chicago Sky will be opening up their season on the road against the Dallas Wing on Wednesday, May 15, at the College Park Center.

This past season, she posted 18.6 points per game.\n\nWilliams attended Gonzaga College Prep outside of Baltimore. The two schools are about an hour apart from each other.

He attended Oklahoma for one season before transferring to USC.\n\nReese is excited to meet up with a DMV native in Williams. But she's also excited about the elite, newcomers who are making their way to Chicago.\n\n\"This rookie class was amazing coming in. I hope the Bulls get some guys, too. We lit right now.

Interestingly, Khloe Kardashian, worth $60 million as per Celebrity Net Worth, is a co-founder of the brand, where she works closely with design and marketing.\n\nFeatured in the campaign, Angel Reese showcased Good American's \"The Long Inseam Denim Collection,\" which includes 33- and 37-inch inseams, per WWD's Renan Botelho. Moreover, photos of the campaign featured eye-catching backdrops of Reese's young and promising career in basketball.\n\nInterestingly, Reese garnered strong traction when she showed up at the 2024 Met Gala, one of the most prestigious events set at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The following day, she played her WNBA preseason game in the Chicago Sky's matchup against the New York Liberty.\n\nAngel Reese showcases custom 16Arlington dress at the 2024 Met Gala\n\nSpeaking with WWD's Renan Bothelo, Reese shared her excitement for being part of this year's Met Gala as she showed up in a custom dress from the 16Arlington clothing brand.\n\n\"I'm just excited to see everyone's outfits,\" Reese said. \"Everyone looks amazing in here. Being here on my 22nd birthday is amazing. I feel beautiful and I feel sexy.\"\n\nTo celebrate her 22nd birthday at the Met Gala, in what was Angel Reese's debut at the event, is already a huge moment for any individual at that young age.\n\nInterestingly, she made sure that she still had her priorities straight, as she immediately went back to her team's practice facility in preparation for the Chicago Sky's preseason game.\n\nIn the Sky's 101-53 victory, Reese dropped 13 points (6-of-10 shooting), five rebounds and two steals. The preseason game did not include 2024 No. 3 pick Kamilla Cardoso due to her shoulder injury, which has left her sidelined for four to six weeks.\n\nThe 2024 WNBA draft class not only featured exciting young talent but it also highlighted the star power potential of each prospect involved. Aside from the upside in rookies like Caitlin Clark and Cameron Brink, fans can look no further than Angel Reese, who is the seventh pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jone_mallorca@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Jone Mallorca", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khlo\u00e9_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/66003-17152646479677-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

She was back in Chicago in time for shootaround the next morning, played a preseason game against the New York Liberty, then showed how her interview game is at another level during Wednesday's Sky media day.\n\nHere's a small sample of Reese's most memorable quotes:\n\n\"Growing up, my grandma just always had my lashes and hair done up. I always felt I wanted to be the cute, pretty girl on the court, but I also wanted to be a dog and have that dog mentality.\"\n\nOn Chicago sports stars Caleb Williams, Keenan Allen, Rome Odunze and Coby White showing up to Tuesday's preseason game:\n\n\"The celebrities are going to be courtside. The Who's Who is going to be courtside. I was at the Met Gala, Usher is going to try to come up to a game in Vegas, and Cardi B. I know some people you all might not think I know, but I know.\"\n\nOn playing against the Liberty's 6-foot-6 Jonquel Jones and 6-4 Breanna Stewart:\n\n\"I am only 6-3, but I have the heart of a lion. Trying to just play a smart game. I'm an amazing rebounder and if my offensive game isn't going, I'll get going rebounding and defense.\"\n\nOn finding her way around Chicago:\n\n\"I just be posting on Twitter what I be wanting to do. If I want some good food, I'll post on Twitter, 'What's the good spots?' And everybody will just lead me to the spot.\"\n\nOn her new home:\n\n\"I wouldn't rather be nowhere else but Chicago. I'm not going to lie to you. I think this is the perfect place for me, perfect fit for me, on and off the court.\"\n\nThe original intention here wasn't to write about Reese, but she gives you no choice. Even her recap of the Met Gala trip had an entertaining spin. Not sure if anyone was really against her making the trip, though. It was a preseason game, after all, not the WNBA Finals.\n\n\"A lot of people told me I shouldn't have went to the Met Gala, I wasn't going to be focused playing against the runner-ups (Liberty),\" Reese said. \"I went to the Met Gala, slayed the Met Gala in New York, came back, slayed against New York. It's what I do.\"\n\nThere are plenty of other storylines to this Sky team. Hall of Famer Teresa Weatherspoon is making her WNBA coaching debut. There's an interesting choice at point guard between Dana Evans, now the final holdover from the Sky's 2021 championship team, and veteran Lindsay Allen. Guard Chennedy Carter, who averaged 17.4 points per game for Atlanta in 2020, is attempting a comeback after not playing in the WNBA last season.\n\nThere are circumstances where an attention-seeker like Reese can be seen as a negative, but this isn't it. Nothing is better for the WNBA than players who are comfortable in the spotlight and embrace their celebrity.\n\nThe league's announcement about finally using charter flights on road trips can be directly connected to the growing fame of players like Reese and Caitlin Clark. Sky veteran Elizabeth Williams understood where credit is due.\n\n\"Angel has 3 million followers, she has a spotlight on her that none of us have,\" Williams said. \"Rather than having an incident occur, I think this is the proactive take. Charters are huge, just for recovery, for safety, for just being a professional. I think it's so significant.\"\n\nReese probably won't be the Sky's best player this season, but she's played well so far, finishing with 13 points and 2 steals in Tuesday's mega-blowout of the Liberty. No one should get carried away about a preseason result, but a win's a win.\n\n\"We understand it's a preseason game,\" Sky GM Jeff Pagliocca said. \"We have perspective, we don't get too high, too low, we have a long way to go, but we're really happy with the group we've put together.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Thursday, pictures of the 6-foot-3 forward endorsing the brand Good American took the internet by storm.\n\nIn the released images, Reese stars as the face of a new campaign by Good American, a clothing line dedicated to catering to women over 5-foot-10. As many fashionistas know, the denim line has Khloe Kardashian as one of its co-founders.\n\nCreating a niche for tall women to shop for clothes without having a problem with sizing, a commenter on X tipped their hat to Kardashian for coming up with such an idea.\n\n\"Wow now I have to support Khloe Kardashian cause she made jeans for the actual tall girls and not just women that are 5'8-5'10,\" the fan wrote.\n\nSome users thought that Angel Reese sporting Good American apparel was a match made in heaven, as the clothing brand selected the perfect face to lead its product line.\n\n\"Good marriage. Stay loyal Reese. If this is your life? Make sure your decisions are sound. Look at Beyonc\u00e9; she's not catering to everyone,\" said Kairos313.\n\nWith the 2024 WNBA regular season starting in just a few days, many are admiring how Reese helped grow attention to women's basketball alongside Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark. Seeing Reese get to model a denim brand gives added excitement to the upcoming 2024 WNBA season.\n\n\"I look forward to watching her and playing her WNBA props for sure. This girl is tough and can play this game!!! Angel is going to excel in the WNBA,\" wrote sportsdar21.\n\n\"Never thought I would say 'I'm ready for WNBA season to start',\" Frank Jagof posted.\n\nMore than basketball, a few X accounts are appreciating the journey of Angel Reese heading to the WNBA.\n\n\"We love seeing more #WNBA players expanding their brands, income streams. You go, ladies! #WBB,\" @PhoenixSuns2 wrote.\n\nIt seems having \"Bayou Barbie\" as a brand endorser is already working for Good American, as one user wanted to know how to purchase the brand's latest collection.\n\n\"Where's the website for the jeans?

Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAngel Reese set the 2024 Met Gala on fire with a mint-green dress, proving she is a modern fashion icon. However, she was also questioned about her choice to attend such events amidst the WNBA's preseason window. In her second WNBA appearance, the NCAA 2023 Most Outstanding Player presented another dominant low-post display and shut down her critics.\n\nAdding 13 points, six rebounds, and one assist in nineteen minutes of playtime, Reese proved that the Met Gala event wasn't a deterrent and that people should stop questioning her personal choices. On X, she let her critics know that she can thrive on the court while upholding her off-court commitments,\n\n\"So now yall can delete them drafts & tweets saying i shouldn't have gone to the met gala & i can't do both. I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME'.\n\nThe sassy tweet of course received a raucous reception from her fans. A fan pointed out how she killed the competition during both the Met Gala and her second WNBA game, \"You ate them up too my girlll\"\n\nAnother fan complimented her accomplishments in both spheres of her life, \"Handling business on and off the court.\"\n\nSince every Reese post attracts a ton of detractors, a fan urged the Bayou Barbie to ignore them as they will persist no matter how well she does, \"Stop reading these negative tweets these clowns will hate\".\n\nThus, the unapologetic 6'3\" Center has provided joy to her fans, showing signs of a fierce athlete. Moreover, her head coach and the league have been right behind the 2024 #7 draft pick.\n\nThe WNBA's official X handle rolled out multiple posts to celebrate Reese's two-day journey. One of the posts pointed out that her 24-hour schedule saw her hit the Met Gala red carpet and then attend her WNBA duties.\n\n\"Training camp in the morning, Met Gala at night, preseason game tomorrow. Just another day in the life for Angel Reese,\" 'WNBA' wrote on X.\n\nHowever, attending the Met Gala did come at a price as she had to skip a practice to grace the event. Apart from Reese, rookie Kamila Cardoso missed the practice because of her off-court commitments. However, her Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon showcased tremendous understanding toward both athletes,\n\n\"There were things that were in place for them that we thought were very important for them to be part of.

In the video, the two superstars briefly discuss LSU, then Cardi B mentions the city of Chicago.\n\nCardi B isn't performing on tour this year, and therefore doesn't have any set dates where she'll be in Chicago.\n\nAlthough we know that the rapper owns homes in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and bought a home in New York in 2021, per the New York Post.\n\n\"These days I don't just live [in] one place, I'm everywhere due to my work. One thing for sure: I needed a home in my home city of NY!\" wrote Cardi B, in an Instagram caption.\n\nUsher is kicking off his 'COMING HOME' world tour on August 15, in Atlanta.

The three players in front of her are Caitlin Clark (-700), Cameron Brink (+1500), and her teammate Kamilla Cardoso (+2000).\n\nSince Cardoso suffered a shoulder injury on May 3 and will be sidelined

We might get those. They just told us when I go back home to Washington, we're playing where the Wizards play. So the change is happening and it's not going to stop here. We're in a great direction with the charter flights.

The group is led by No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark, who went to the Indiana Fever.\n\nThe Sky had two of the top seven picks, allowing them to add Reese and reigning NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player winner Kamilla Cardoso. Chicago will have to wait to see its new frontcourt duo together after Cardoso was diagnosed with a shoulder injury that will keep her out four to six weeks.\n\nAnticipation for the WNBA season is off the charts. Three teams -- Atlanta Dream, Las Vegas Aces, Dallas Wings -- have sold out their allotted season tickets. The Fever's home opener against the New York Liberty on May 16 has seen a 50 percent price increase on the resale market since Clark declared for the draft in February.\n\nReese, Clark, Cardoso, Cameron Brink and the many other talented rookies are coming into the WNBA looking to make their name against already-established stars like A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Alyssa Thomas, Jewell Loyd and others.\n\nFans and celebrities alike will start filling the arenas when the regular season begins on May 14 with four games, highlighted by Clark's debut for the Fever against the Connecticut Sun and the reigning WNBA champion Aces hosting the Phoenix Mercury.\n\nReese's debut with the Sky will be on May 15 against the Wings at College Park Center.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com",

But the team's many new faces were on display at Media Day.\n\nIt's a new era of Sky basketball, headlined by their high-profile rookies Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso, along with a new general manager and new head coach, Teresa Weatherspoon.\n\nFresh off a 48-point thumping of the New York Liberty in its last preseason game, the team is hoping to build a winner and capitalize on the attention on the sport of women's basketball at the moment.\n\n\"So many people love women's basketball,\" Reese said. \"I think it was only season ticket holders in the place last night and there were so many people there. So the games are gonna be packed, I feel like standing room only sometimes.\"\n\nSky General Manager Jeff Pagliocca added, \"It's an exciting time in the WNBA. It's not just here. It's everywhere, but with players that we drafted, they have a lot of attention and we got a lot more in terms of eyes on us and excitement.\"\n\nIt was an exciting couple of days recenlty for Reese who, after practice on Monday, flew to New York for the Met Gala before returning for the Sky's preseason game on Tuesday. She did so all with the blessing of her coach, but perhaps not everyone.\n\n\"A lot of people told me I shouldn't have went to the Met Gala. I wasn't gonna be focused playing against the runner ups and I went to the Met Gala, slayed the Met Gala in New York. Came back, slayed against New York. It's what I do. Obviously I give a lot of confidence to so many different people and knowing like, I'm not one dimensional. Women don't have to be one dimensional.\"\n\nCardoso also spoke for the first time since she was ruled out for four to six weeks with a shoulder injury.\n\n\"I'd say it's frustrating,\" she said. \"I never got hurt before. I never had to sit out a game before in my life so it's really frustrating, but I know I got some really good people here that got my back and I just gotta trust God. I believe that everything happens for a reason, even if I don't understand what is the reason right now.\"\n\nReese and basically all of her teammates said the WNBA's decision to move to charter flights for teams instead of flying commercially is a great step forward for the league.\n\nAs Cardoso put it, charter flights are great because going through airports isn't.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/08/2edc5d42-db24-4f58-b3d8-227c813083f1/thumbnail/1200x630/9113d2d6009b8019d460970c2fe8ae26/snapshot-2024-05-08t172356-522.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 139, "textEnd": 145}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The pre-season encounter featuring Angel Reese's Chicago and last year's WNBA finalists, the New York Liberty, ended in a massive 101-53 victory in favor of the Windy City. The three-time All-American forward had a huge say in how things turned out to be by the end of the night. Seemingly, she stood up against the likes of Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones in a phenomenal display of her defensive skills. However, that has something to do with her rival-turned-teammate, Kamilla Cardoso.\n\nAn elated Angel Reese addressed the media after her scintillating effort. On being asked to reflect on her defensive skills, Reese said, \"Going into the game last night, coach Sydney had told me I had guarded 6-7 Kamilla obviously for a while now. Just being able to stay strong and go up. I mean, I'm only 6-3 but I kinda have a heart of a lion. Knowing how talented Jonquel (Jones) is and how talented Stewie (Breanna Stewart) is, I'm just trying to play the smart game.\"\n\nFor a second straight night, the 2024 SEC Player of the Year made the starting line-up. In the 19 minutes that head coach Teresa Weatherspoon entrusted her with, Reese was able to register 13 points and 5 rebounds next to her name. In addition to this, she was 6 of 10 while shooting from the field, along with 2 steals and 1 assist. Consequently, these numbers made her the third-best performer of the night after Marina Mabrey and Dana Evans.\n\nNow, with the pre-season being concluded, Angel Reese and Co. gear up for their regular-season campaign.\n\nThe commencement of the Eastern Conference will take place in Chicago Sky's opening two clashes against the 3x WNBA champions Dallas Wings. Both of these games will take place at Dallas' home turf, the College Park Center, on May 16 and 19, respectively. Another road game awaits Chicago when they will again lock horns with the Liberty at the Barclays Center. Following this, the Sky will next play host to Connecticut, Seattle, and Los Angeles at the Wintrust Arena in the upcoming three games to cap off the month.\n\nAt the moment, there is no denying that Angel Reese has the pedigree to take on some of the big guns in the league. She provided proof of that in the opening two games of her professional career. So, what more does this tenacious rookie have to offer the Sky? Fans are hoping to find that out soon.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonquel_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonquel Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Evans_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana Evans (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-16T002009Z_139855319_MT1USATODAY23034279_RTRMADP_3_WNBA-DRAFT-1-473x315.jpg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1836, "textEnd": 1849}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Angel Reese declares herself the queen of WNBA fashion with a look that gets everyone's attention\n\nThere's no denying that Angel Reese is a star in the basketball world. An impressive college career at LSU, paired with clever marketing and social media behavior, has earned her plenty of fans over the years.\n\nNow that she's in the WNBA, her fandom will only continue to grow. She's accustomed to celebrities making it out to her games in the past, but she's already getting a taste of the high-profile athletes who might be in attendance during her debut Chicago Sky season.\n\nAt the Sky's second preseason game, Chicago Bears players Caleb Williams, Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze were sitting courtside.\n\nReese's teammate Dana Evans spoke about what it means to have NFL players like those three make it out to games.

Clark also wore a Prada look on the WNBA Draft red carpet.\n\nAngel Reese Fronts Good American's Denim Campaign [PHOTOS]\n\nLaunch Gallery: Angel Reese Fronts Good American's Denim Campaign [PHOTOS]\n\nBest of WWD", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renan_botelho@yahoo.com", "name": "Renan Botelho", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khlo\u00e9_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Wear_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Wear Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Louboutin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Louboutin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Women's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Women's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l1PgSsHXhWrI7zxtbFmJrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NTI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/wwd_409/cdf92162de5e07bc99d371cf9175e8b7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The WNBA rookie star forward for the Chicago Sky started her latest birthday at practice before flying to New York to attend her first Met Gala.\n\nReese is not the typical women's basketball player. She announced her decision to enter the WNBA Draft in a Vogue feature and high-fashion photo shoot. Her attendance at this year's Met Gala made her the second WNBA player to ever attend the esteemed event after Brittney Griner attended last year.\n\nShe has brand deals with Reebok, Airbnb, Beats by Dre, PlayStation, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Tampax, Topps, ZOA Energy, Starry, Mielle Organics, SI Swimsuit, Caktus, Campus Ink, Raising Cane's, Intuit Turbo Tax, JanSport, Bose and Sonic -- among other partnerships. At the start of her advertising surge, however, was Cruz Textures, a Black-owned hair business that specializes in providing top-of-the-line bundles.\n\nThis is something that I prayed about, and I got the go-ahead from the good man above. I knew this was where I needed to go with this business. It's something I needed to bring to the economy, to the rest of the world -- but do it my way, the Cruz way, which is a way of luxury but still gives access to everyone to be able to have it.\n\nIt's luxury hair from the moment you get on our website to the message you've received the hair in the mail all the way until the install. It's something we take pride in. I am very blessed to be able to provide this product to the market.\n\nWhere did Cruz come from?\n\nCruz means cross in the Spanish language. It's a way I keep my faith very rooted and involved in my business. Because that's something I don't play around with.\n\nWhat was it like for you to provide branding opportunities to Black female athletes like Angel Reese?\n\nIt means the absolute world. It's an honor for me to be able to do that. My Number 1 goal before I launched Cruz Textures was to have a very strong brand ambassador program.\n\nWhen you look at women hoopers and partnerships they have with beauty businesses, it's very small and few [and far] between ... [and with us], their hair is going to look good at the beginning to the end of the game.\n\nSoon after, we went to Angel Reese, who was playing for LSU at the time -- and she had our raw Indian hair in when they won the national championship. It's one of our popular textures, especially when it gets hot outside because the curls are for the girls.\n\nWhen she won the national championship, Cruz Textures was flooded, and everyone wanted the Angel Reese loose curls. She was so thankful, a great person to work with and was outstanding [altogether].\n\nYes, and she has loved the Cruz Textures product. She shows our hair during interviews, and it has definitely taken off ...", "source": {"uri": "rollingout.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Out"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beats Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittney Griner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topps", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Topps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reebok", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reebok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JanSport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JanSport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bose Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_ambassador", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brand ambassador"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot_20240416_101601_YouTube-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549794", "eventUri": "eng-9549794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

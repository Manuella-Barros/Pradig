The video shows a reporter asking her: \"Meanwhile, it's known that Ukraine itself has mixed views on this ideology. Why aren't we condemning Ukrainian manifestations of Nazism and continuing to sponsor it?\"\n\nJean-Pierre responded: \"Seventy-nine years ago, the United States and our Ukrainian allies joined forces to combat the oppressive regimes of Hitler and Stalin. While Berlin is now an ally, the threat from the East persists. That's why we're committed to standing by Ukraine and offering our full support in any way we can.\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nThis video has been edited. To begin with, it contains Russian subtitles, the first clue that it was created by misinformation actors. Newsweek found a version of the same video on a pro-Russia Telegram channel, posted before the English-language post on X. Reports about the video have been shared on Russian news sites and blogs.\n\nThe notion of \"de-Nazification\" has been repeatedly used by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin in an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe video itself sounds and looks unusual, with speech not matching the lip movements of either the reporter or Jean-Pierre.\n\nAs it turns out, the video is a manipulation of a press conference Jean-Pierre gave on Tuesday at the White House. At that event, the reporter whose voice was manipulated in the video on X asked her about famine in Gaza and disruption to humanitarian aid.\n\nThere was no mention of Hitler, Stalin or the Second World War during the press conference. It is likely the video and audio of Jean-Pierre were created using artificial intelligence tools.\n\nJean-Pierre did speak about Ukraine, taking questions on Ukrainian reports about a foiled assassination attempt on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the recent aid package for Ukraine approved by Congress.\n\nThe press secretary also answered questions on what Biden thought about Putin's reelection in March. Jean-Pierre said the U.S. directed its embassy not to attend Putin's inauguration in protest of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\n\"So, as you also know, under Putin's leadership Russia launched this brutal and unprovoked war, and Russian authorities have engaged in draconian repression at home as well as aggressive actions abroad,\" she said. \"And so I think we've made ourselves very clear here. I just don't have anything to add.\"\n\nWhile the video may be an attempt to make Jean-Pierre look foolish, it doesn't make any sense. There was no U.S./Ukrainian joint fighting against Hitler's or Stalin's forces. The U.S. was allied with the Soviet Union during the war against Nazi Germany, which unconditionally surrendered 79 years ago, ending the conflict in Europe,\n\nUkraine was invaded and occupied by the Nazis throughout most of the war. It was not fully returned to Soviet control until late 1944.\n\nJean-Pierre did not say that World War II was won by Americans and Ukrainians. The video shared on social media, which appeared on Russian social media and news channels earlier this week, seems to be an AI-manipulated version of a press conference held at the White House earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_norton@newsweek.com", "name": "Tom Norton", "type": "author", "isAgency":

While Berlin is now an ally, the threat from the East persists. That's why we're committed to standing by Ukraine and offering our full support in any way we can.\"\n\nA version of the video was shared more than 1,000 times on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFact check roundup: What's true and false two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThe clip was digitally edited to add fabricated audio. The original video of the May 7 White House press briefing shows the reporter asking about humanitarian relief in Gaza, not World War II alliances.\n\nThe 29-second video shows Jean-Pierre answering a question from Andrew Feinberg, a reporter for the London-based Independent, during a press briefing May 7 at the White House.\n\nBut the question he posed had nothing to do with Ukraine, and Jean-Pierre's response made no mention of any World War II alliances. The doctored clip with Russian subtitles includes fabricated audio that does not match the lip movements from either the reporter or Jean-Pierre.\n\nFact check: No, Biden is not sending US troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine\n\nIn the original video posted to YouTube by the White House, the reporter asks Jean-Pierre if President Joe Biden's administration plans to pressure Israel into allowing humanitarian aid to reach those in Gaza affected by famine.\n\nJean-Pierre's answer had nothing to do with World War II. She called the closings of two Gaza crossings \"unacceptable\" and said Biden phoned Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to tell him they should be open.\n\nNone of the questions she was asked during the briefing about the Russia-Ukraine conflict had anything to do with World War II.\n\nThe fabricated video also mischaracterizes the alliances during that war. The U.S. and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, were on the same side against Nazi Germany, which under Adolf Hitler occupied most of the Ukrainian territory.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nPolitiFact and Lead Stories also debunked the claim.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The video also appears on Russian website Pravda.\n\nWhile some social posts appeared to criticize Jean-Pierre and the White House by calling her a \"clown\", one X user actually wondered if she misspoke.\n\nDid White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre say the U.S. and Ukraine fought together in World War II?\n\nNo, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre didn't say the U.S. and Ukraine fought together in World War II. The audio from a press conference was replaced with fake audio.\n\nThere was a press briefing held on May 7, but the audio in the entire viral video clip is fake. The audio was likely generated by an artificial intelligence program.\n\nThe viral video is made up of two clips from the official White House video of the press briefing. We confirmed the visuals are from the May 7th press briefing by comparing the edited video with the fake audio and the original White House video from the briefing.\n\nIn both videos, The Independent's correspondent Andrew Feinberg is holding the same pen while surrounded by the same people. Jean-Pierre, in both videos, is also making the same gestures behind the podium and wearing the same outfit.\n\nOne clear indication that the audio in the viral video is fake is that the sound doesn't match Feinberg's lip movements.\n\nIn the real briefing, Feinberg is asking about the White House's plan to encourage Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip. In the video with the fake audio, his comments about Gaza were replaced with the question about Ukraine.\n\nJean-Pierre, in the real briefing, was talking about how President Joe Biden was looking forward to hosting Romanian President Klaus Iohannis later that day at the White House. Iohannis was at the White House on May 7 to celebrate Romania's 20th anniversary as a member of the NATO Alliance. Those statements were replaced with the fake response about Ukraine.\n\nWhen Russia first invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the invasion was a mission to \"demilitarize and denazify\" the country.

While Berlin is now an ally, the threat from the East persists. That's why we're committed to standing by Ukraine and offering our full support in any way we can.\"\n\nThe clip, which includes Russian-language subtitles, appears to have pinballed across Russian Telegram channels before spreading in English and Spanish to X and other platforms, including Facebook.\n\nIt echoes the Moscow-driven narrative about Ukrainian leaders being \"Nazis,\" a staple of the war-related disinformation that has flooded social media since the start of Russia's invasion. It also attempts to portray Jean-Pierre as ignorant on the history of World War II, when the US and Soviet Union allied against Nazi Germany.\n\nBut the video is manipulated, with inauthentic audio layered over unrelated clips from a press conference that were spliced together.\n\nHany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told AFP a model trained to distinguish real from fake voices classified the audio for both speakers as generated by artificial intelligence (archived here).\n\nAnother tool that measures the synchronization between lip movements and speech also assessed the video as fake, Farid said, aligning with what he said were \"clear visual clues\" of manipulation.\n\n\"I am confident that this is a lip-sync deepfake powered by AI-generated voices,\" Farid said in a May 9 email.\n\nGiven the chance to speak, Feinberg mentioned the famine sweeping Gaza and the closure of checkpoints for humanitarian aid at Kerem Shalom and Rafah in southern Israel.\n\n\"Does the White House have any plan to convince, cajole, pressure Israel into allowing a steady flow of aid into Gaza, other than asking nicely?\" he asked.\n\nIn response, Jean-Pierre recited data on the commercial and humanitarian trucks that have entered Gaza in recent weeks, saying Kerem Shalom and Rafah are \"not the only two\" crossings, but that aid is still important and \"it is unacceptable that these two crossings are closed.\"\n\nThe visual of Jean-Pierre featured in the altered clip, meanwhile, comes from another part of the press conference, when she fielded a question about NATO's leadership.\n\nHer stance at the podium and hand gestures match those from the manipulated version shared online.\n\nThe press secretary never mentioned Hitler or Stalin at any point during the back-and-forth with Feinberg, in response to the question about NATO or elsewhere during the briefing.\n\n\"This exchange did not happen,\" White House Senior Deputy

While Berlin is now an ally, the threat from the East persists. That's why we're committed to standing by Ukraine and offering our full support in any way we can.\"\n\nA version of the video was shared more than 1,000 times on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFact check roundup: What's true and false two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThe clip was digitally edited to add fabricated audio. The original video of the May 7 White House press briefing shows the reporter asking about humanitarian relief in Gaza, not World War II alliances.\n\nThe 29-second video shows Jean-Pierre answering a question from Andrew Feinberg, a reporter for the London-based Independent, during a press briefing May 7 at the White House.\n\nBut the question he posed had nothing to do with Ukraine, and Jean-Pierre's response made no mention of any World War II alliances. The doctored clip with Russian subtitles includes fabricated audio that does not match the lip movements from either the reporter or Jean-Pierre.\n\nFact check: No, Biden is not sending US troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine\n\nIn the original video posted to YouTube by the White House, the reporter asks Jean-Pierre if President Joe Biden's administration plans to pressure Israel into allowing humanitarian aid to reach those in Gaza affected by famine.\n\nJean-Pierre's answer had nothing to do with World War II. She called the closings of two Gaza crossings \"unacceptable\" and said Biden phoned Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to tell him they should be open.\n\nNone of the questions she was asked during the briefing about the Russia-Ukraine conflict had anything to do with World War II.\n\nThe fabricated video also mischaracterizes the alliances during that war. The U.S. and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, were on the same side against Nazi Germany, which under Adolf Hitler occupied most of the Ukrainian territory.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nPolitiFact and Lead Stories also debunked the claim.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The video also appears on Russian website Pravda.\n\nWhile some social posts appeared to criticize Jean-Pierre and the White House by calling her a \"clown\", one X user actually wondered if she misspoke.\n\nDid White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre say the U.S. and Ukraine fought together in World War II?\n\nNo, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre didn't say the U.S. and Ukraine fought together in World War II. The audio from a press conference was replaced with fake audio.\n\nThere was a press briefing held on May 7, but the audio in the entire viral video clip is fake. The audio was likely generated by an artificial intelligence program.\n\nThe viral video is made up of two clips from the official White House video of the press briefing. We confirmed the visuals are from the May 7th press briefing by comparing the edited video with the fake audio and the original White House video from the briefing.\n\nIn both videos, The Independent's correspondent Andrew Feinberg is holding the same pen while surrounded by the same people. Jean-Pierre, in both videos, is also making the same gestures behind the podium and wearing the same outfit.\n\nOne clear indication that the audio in the viral video is fake is that the sound doesn't match Feinberg's lip movements.\n\nIn the real briefing, Feinberg is asking about the White House's plan to encourage Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip. In the video with the fake audio, his comments about Gaza were replaced with the question about Ukraine.\n\nJean-Pierre, in the real briefing, was talking about how President Joe Biden was looking forward to hosting Romanian President Klaus Iohannis later that day at the White House. Iohannis was at the White House on May 7 to celebrate Romania's 20th anniversary as a member of the NATO Alliance. Those statements were replaced with the fake response about Ukraine.\n\nWhen Russia first invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the invasion was a mission to \"demilitarize and denazify\" the country.

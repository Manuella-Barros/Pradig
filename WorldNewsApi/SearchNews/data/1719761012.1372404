{"id": 225050182, "title": "Trump Squeezes in All-Caps Meltdown Before Jury Begins Deliberating", "text": "The 12 jurors in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial are set to begin deliberating Wednesday whether to convict the former president of a criminal offense. After Tuesday\u2019s marathon day of closing arguments, Trump took to Truth Social to post a series of all-caps rants on the eve of a day that could end with him becoming a convicted felon. \u201cCAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I, AS A DEFENDANT, AM NOT ALLOWED TO REBUT OR CORRECT THE MANY LIES TOLD DURUNG THE 5 HOUR FILIBUSTER JUST PUT ON BY THE SOROS BACKED D.A.\u2019s OFFICE IN THE MANHATTAN COURT.\u201d Trump wrote in one post, referencing the prosecution\u2019s lengthy presentation of closing arguments on Tuesday. \u201cTHE GREATEST CASE I\u2019VE EVER SEEN FOR RELIANCE ON COUNSEL, AND JUDGE MERCHAN WILL NOT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, LET ME USE THAT AS A DEFENSE IN THIS RIGGED TRIAL. ANOTHER TERM, ADVICE OF COUNSEL DEFENSE!,\u201d he added in another post. Trump\u2019s attorneys were not actually barred from using the argument and made a point in March to inform the judge that they would not pursue \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d as their defense strategy. Trump also took indirect aim at Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer who has become a central witness in the case against the former president. \u201cI DIDN\u2019T HAVE A FIXER, I HAD A LAWYER WHO, AT THAT TIME, WAS FULLY ACCREDITED AND ACCEPTED WITHIN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY, BUT THE JUDGE IS NOT ALLOWING ME TO USE THE RELIANCE ON COUNSEL DEFENSE,\u201d Trump griped, reiterating his long-standing claim that Cohen himself had been responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and the subsequent alleged falsification of business records in an attempt to cover up the scheme. \u201cI MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY NOT ALLOWED TO DO SO AND, THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A VERY UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND RESTRICTIVE GAG ORDER. NOT FAIR \u2014 FREEDOM!\u201d Trump added. The former president has been barred from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors, court staff, and other parties involved in his trial via a limited gag order implemented by Judge Juan Merchan. It hasn\u2019t really provided any deterrence to Trump\u2019s public ranting about the case, though. Throughout closing arguments, Trump managed to shoot off a few brief summaries regarding his thoughts on the prosecution\u2019s presentation: \u201cBORING!\u201d and \u201cFILIBUSTER!\u201d he wrote during breaks from the trial. The former president addressed an appearance by actor Robert De Niro outside of the courthouse, as well. The legendary actor was tapped on Tuesday by the Biden-Harris campaign to provide counter-messaging to the constant stream of Trump allies who have used the trial as a gathering point to broadcast the former president\u2019s messaging, and sparred with pro-Trump protesters during his appearance. \u201cI never knew how small, both mentally and physically, Wacko Former Actor Robert De Niro was. Today, De Niro, who suffers from an incurable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, commonly known in the medical community as TDS, was met, outside the Courthouse, with a force far greater than the Radical Left \u2013 MAGA,\u201d Trump wrote late on Tuesday. Ahead of his arrival in court on Wednesday, Trump posted in all-caps yet again, calling the trial a \u201cKANGAROO COURT\u201d and a \u201cBIDEN PUSHED WITCH HUNT.\u201d While the president likes to keep his phone at arms reach and his backers within shouting distance, as of Wednesday the case against him will be exclusively in the hands of the jury.", "summary": "The former president raged at the prosecution, and Robert De Niro, ahead of what could be a historic day in court", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rages-truth-social-hush-money-jury-deliberation-1235029278/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/trump-jury-rant.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:50:25", "author": "Nikki Mccann Ramirez,Nikkimccannramirez", "authors": ["Nikki Mccann Ramirez", "Nikkimccannramirez"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.441}

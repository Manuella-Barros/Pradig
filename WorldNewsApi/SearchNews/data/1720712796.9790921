The rank and files of the Telugu Desam, who were on cloud nine with the party\u2019s landslide victory, are gearing up to make the swearing-in ceremony a grand event. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders are expected to be present at the oath-taking programme. The initial plan was to hold the swearing-in ceremony on the banks of River Krishna at Rayapudi in Amaravati, but it was shifted to near the AIIMS in Mangalagiri. Proposals on the two places were rejected by the TD team led by state TD president K Atchannaidu. He inspected a place at Gannavaram but that was also rejected. The place near the IT Park was finally approved. It may be recalled that Naidu as CM released Pasupu-Kumkuma and addressed a mammoth public meeting here in 2019. State chief secretary Neerabh Prasad inspected the arrangements in Kesarapalli village on Sunday. He was accompanied by DGP Harish Gupta, programme special officers PS Pradyumna, Babu A and G Veera Pandyan, agriculture commissioner Harikiran, additional DGP Shankabrata Bagchi, IGs Rajasekhar Babu and Ashok Kumar, NTR District Police Commissioner Ramakrishna, Krishna district collector DK Balaji and Krishna district SP Adnan Naeem Asmi.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/andhra-pradesh/one-lakh-people-likely-to-attend-chandrababus-swearing-in-ceremony-898145", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/09/1095999-aa-2295120.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:19:47", "author": "DC Correspondent", "authors": ["DC Correspondent"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.153}

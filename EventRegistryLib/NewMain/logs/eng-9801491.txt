Kokanovic and his fellow villagers argue that the development of what is planned to be Europe's largest lithium mine would have detrimental effects on their environment and public health.\n\nThe Serbian government recently reinstated Rio Tinto's licence to develop the mine in the Jadar region of western Serbia, reversing a previous decision made two years ago when the licence was annulled due to environmental protests. The mine, if constructed, would supply around 90% of Europe's current lithium needs, positioning Rio Tinto as a major global player in lithium production, which is crucial for electric vehicle and mobile device batteries.\n\nThe villagers' warnings about the potential hazards of mining, including pollution from arsenic, sulphuric acid, and dust, have prompted a wave of protests across Serbia. Over the past month, demonstrations have erupted in numerous cities as citizens rally against the project. The protesters have set a deadline of August 10 for the government to pass legislation banning lithium exploration, a demand the government has yet to address.\n\nKokanovic, who manages 30 hectares of land and produces up to 100,000 litres of milk annually, is leading the charge against the mine, asserting that the project would lead to severe environmental degradation and health risks for local residents. \"The mine would be the destruction of Serbia at the expense of our health to free the European Union from reliance on China for lithium,\" Kokanovic stated, expressing his belief that the mine would benefit Europe at Serbia's expense. He declared, \"There will be no mine here.\"\n\nThe Serbian government views the $2.4 billion Jadar lithium project as a crucial element in strengthening the country's struggling economy and has not yet heeded the protesters' demands. In response to escalating tensions, Kokanovic and his neighbours have vowed to escalate their protests, including a planned rally in Belgrade this Saturday.\n\nNeighbour Marijana Petkovic voiced her community's resolve to physically block any mining equipment if necessary. \"We will defend our homes, our land, our church, and our cemetery. Further radicalisation will be the next step if necessary,\" she asserted.\n\nIn an effort to address concerns about potential pollution, Rio Tinto has published new environmental studies claiming the project's safety. Additionally, the Serbian health ministry has established a commission to evaluate the impact of lithium mining on human health. President Aleksandar Vucic, addressing concerns on Wednesday, assured that no mining activities would commence for two years, suggesting that current fears are premature.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the mine intensified following a deal signed on July 19 by Vucic, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and EU Energy Commissioner Maros Sefcovic. The agreement aims to grant EU member states access to raw materials from Serbia, including lithium, to decrease the EU's dependency on imports from America and Asia.\n\nDespite these assurances, opposition remains strong. Protesters in Kragujevac continued to demonstrate, underscoring their refusal to accept the project. \"We do not want lithium in Serbia. If the damage to the environment is higher than the economic benefit, then it is clear why the project is not good,\" said demonstrator Aleksandar Jankovic.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk",

Our sole demand will be a permanent ban on lithium exploration and exploitation throughout Serbia. We will also outline our next steps to stop any new lithium mines from opening anywhere in Serbia,\" Kokanovic said, noting that the event is organized by all Serbian environmental organizations.\n\nHe expressed doubts about the possibility of a law permanently banning lithium exploration and exploitation in Serbia being adopted by August 10.\n\n\"The government can only enact such a law under public pressure, as it did in 2022 when it withdrew the decree on the realization of the Jadar project. On Saturday, August 10, it is crucial that we show our determination, and our actions will influence what further steps the government will take,\" Kokanovic said.\n\nHe stressed that ecological groups are not foreign agents and do not work for the government and emphasized that this fight goes beyond politics, religion, nationality, and sexual orientation.\n\n\"People need to understand that our actions on August 10 and in the following days will define us forever. This is literally a battle for the survival of Serbia, not just for Gornje Nedeljice and Loznica. If the lithium and boron mining project in Jadar goes ahead, all other projects across the country will follow, and we will become a mining colony and our environment will be devastated,\" Kokanovic warned.\n\nEnvironmental organizations have scheduled a central protest against mining for Saturday, August 10, in Belgrade. The protest will take place at the Terazije square, starting at 7pm.\n\nRecent days have seen protests in 28 cities across Serbia, and according to current announcements, at least 23 more cities will host protest gatherings by Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "n1info.rs", "dataType": "news", "title": "N1"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadar_(Serbia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadar (Serbia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lithium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(corporation)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Tinto (corporation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gornje_Nedeljice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gornje Nedeljice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gornje Nedeljice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terazije", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terazije"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loznica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loznica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Loznica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://n1info.rs/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/28/1719599613-kokanovic.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801491", "eventUri": "eng-9801491", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 236, "freq": 5}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Unheralded and arranged at short notice, his meeting a couple of weeks ago with Serbia's President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 was nonetheless quite the party.\n\nAccompanying Scholz were senior executives from Mercedes, Stellantis, the mining company Rio Tinto and three electric vehicle battery manufacturers -- not to mention Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the EU commissioner in charge of critical raw materials strategy, and the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\nTogether they hailed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the EU and Serbia to forge a partnership in critical raw materials and the establishment of a value chain for the manufacture of batteries and EVs.\n\nThis is a big deal, economically and politically. In the scramble for secure supplies of critical raw materials required for the green transition, the EU has been limping behind the US and China. Serbia has one of the largest lithium deposits in Europe, enough for an estimated 1mn EV batteries a year.\n\nThe lithium in Serbia's Jadar valley is not the only source in Europe but, unlike the Chinese and Americans, Europeans are either more concerned about the environmental impact of large-scale mining or they are determined nimbyists, depending on your attitude. Without more access to metals such as lithium, the EU will neither meet its carbon reduction goals nor keep up with its competitors.\n\nScholz only agreed to go to Belgrade after Serbia reversed a 2022 decision to cancel a contract with Rio Tinto to exploit the lithium located near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The renewal of Rio Tinto's planning licence comes two months after Vu\u010di\u0107 turned down a request from China's President Xi Jinping, for access to the metal. \"China has enough already,\" Vu\u010di\u0107 is said to have remarked in a reference to Chinese control of a copper mine in Bor, eastern Serbia.\n\nThis is further evidence that while Vu\u010di\u0107 continues to enjoy close political relations with China and Russia, he is integrating his economy ever more tightly with Europe and the US. The Jadar valley decision follows Serbia's agreement to buy 12 Rafale jets from France rather than Russian MiGs and the revelation that Serbia is a key supplier of munitions to Ukraine.\n\nSeveral influential western tech companies, such as Microsoft, Siemens and the American electric truck maker Rivian, have made big investments in Belgrade, attracted by a cheap, skilled workforce.\n\nMany observers perceive Serbia to be a close ally of Russia and President Vladimir Putin. Yet Vu\u010di\u0107 has long been the Janus of the Balkans, looking both east and west. With the lithium decision he is sticking his neck out. He faces stiff opposition to it from three very different groups.\n\nSerbia's energetic environmental activists claim the Jadar project will harm the local ecology. They have organised protests across Serbia and point to the damage done by the Chinese-run copper mine. Rio Tinto and the EU contend that the Jadar development will be subject to more stringent environmental standards.\n\nFlorian Bieber, a Graz university political scientist, warns that as a quid pro quo for the lithium deal, the EU might ignore Vu\u010di\u0107's dictatorial tendencies, including his tight control of the media and dubious electoral practices.\n\nThat feeds into the wider politics of the western Balkans. Supporters of Kosovo and Bosnia have accused the EU of not responding to Serbia's alleged attempts to undermine their territorial integrity -- a claim European diplomats have rejected.\n\nBut Vu\u010di\u0107's policies have also upset Moscow. Just before Scholz's trip, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, visited Belgrade. His meeting with Vu\u010di\u0107 was described by one insider as \"frosty\". According to this person, \"Grushko sat down and started reading a list of 23 complaints, including the Kremlin's fury at Belgrade's decision to supply Ukraine with munitions. When Grushko got about halfway through the list, Vu\u010di\u0107 stood up, announced the meeting was over and walked out.\"\n\nVu\u010di\u0107 is a past master at gesture politics. But this goes beyond that. He is taking a big risk and so is the EU. If Rio Tinto can exploit the lithium with minimum damage to the environment, the rewards are considerable. But failure will both erode Vu\u010di\u0107's iron grip on power in Serbia and leave the EU's critical raw materials policy looking, if not broken, then certainly tattered.", "source": {"uri":

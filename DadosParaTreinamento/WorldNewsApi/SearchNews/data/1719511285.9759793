{"id": 223760576, "title": "How Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s Murder Raised Domestic Violence Awareness and Led to Lifesaving Laws That Protect Victims", "text": "On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s body lay in a pool of blood in the tiny courtyard of her Brentwood, California, townhouse, with her two young children asleep inside. The world was shocked to learn about the brutal murder of former NFL star O.J. Simpson's ex-wife. But few knew about the years of abuse she had suffered at the hands of the once beloved football player who rose to further stardom because of his Hertz commercials and roles in The Naked Gun movies. The beatings, constant put-downs and terror Nicole endured were made public during the so-called \"The Trial of the Century, when O.J. was charged with murdering his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman, 25. In 1995, O.J. was famously acquitted of killing them. In 1997, he was found liable for Nicole and Ron\u2019s deaths at a civil trial, where he was ordered to pay a $33 million settlement to their families. He paid very little over the years. And when he died from cancer on April 10 at the age of 76, still maintaining his innocence, the amount he owed Goldman\u2019s family totaled more than $114 million. Nicole\u2019s vicious murder rocked her family to the core, leaving a hole in their lives. But her death also led her family to bring national awareness to domestic violence, including helping to make sweeping changes to laws and improving the life for abuse victims across the nation. \"Unfortunately, it took my sister, my sister's life, to pass the Violence Against Women Act,\" Nicole's sister Denise Brown, 66, tells PEOPLE. \"And that was back in 1995.\u201d To mark the 30th anniversary of Nicole\u2019s murder, Denise and her sisters Dominique, 59, and Tanya, 54, open up about Nicole in the upcoming Lifetime documentary series titled The Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and open up to PEOPLE in this week's cover story. Airing over two nights on June 1 and June 2, the documentary series features new details about Nicole\u2019s life and death as well as never-before-seen footage of her. For more on the life of Nicole Brown Simpson, as shared by her three sisters, subscribe now to PEOPLE, or pick up this week's issue, on newsstands Friday. In 1992, Nicole filed for divorce, hoping to get away from her abusive husband, but the cycle of violence continued until her murder. It was only after Nicole\u2019s death that Denise and her sisters learned the disturbing extent about her life with O.J., though Denise admits she witnessed uncomfortable and terrifying moments along the way. When Nicole was pregnant, \u201che was calling her a fat pig,\u201d Denise recalls. In 1989, Denise took pictures of Nicole\u2019s bruised face \u2014 photographs that were later shown in court during the trial. \u201cI thought they were isolated incidents,\u201d says Denise. \u201cThe next day Nicole would be back, like, \u2018Oh, everything\u2019s okay. We talked about it. It was my fault.'\" Denise says she and her family had no idea how to spot the signs of domestic abuse until after Nicole died. \u201cThen you get educated on it. You see all the signs, you go, 'Oh my God.'\" Denise continues: \u201cThat's why I think education is so important when it comes to domestic violence, the power and control of one human being over another.\u201d Denise admits, for example, to \u201csaying the wrong thing\u201d to Nicole when questioned why she refused to leave O.J. after a particularly brutal attack. \u201cI said, \u2018God, why are you with this a------? Why are you staying with him?\u2019 Those are things you don't say to a victim of domestic violence,\" she says. Instead, says Denise, \"You listen to them because you don't want them to isolate themselves.\" Denise and her sisters are heartened that Nicole leaves behind a legacy of helping other domestic violence victims. \u201cThe Violence Against Women Act was passed, and that was due to Nicole's murder,\" she says. To make that happen, Denise says, \u201cI went to Congress and I helped with the passing of the bill.\" A year later, she says, the 24-Hour National Domestic Violence Hotline was formed. And then came the VINE system \u2014 Victim Information Notification Every Day \u2014 that alerts victims to changes in an inmate's status. Says Denise, \u201cI want people to know what her role was, the pain that she suffered, and what her role was after her murder, and what she has done to help other victims of domestic violence.\u201d If you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.

{"id": 231941494, "title": "Modi 3.0's Cabinet Conundrum: Can He Fit More Than 81 Ministers?", "text": "Narendra Modi is set to be sworn in as Prime Minister for a third consecutive term at 7:15 pm at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on June 9. This achievement places him alongside former PM Jawaharlal Nehru as the only leaders to serve three back-to-back terms.Cabinet CompositionModis new Cabinet will be limited to 81 ministers due to constitutional constraints. The Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003, mandates that the total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, cannot exceed 15% of the total number of Lok Sabha members. With 543 members, this means a cap of 81 ministers.Historical Cabinet SizesIn Modis first term after the 2014 elections, his Cabinet began with 45 members. It included 23 Cabinet Ministers, 10 Ministers of State with independent charge, and 12 Ministers of State. The first major expansion occurred on November 9, 2014, increasing the total to 66 ministers.Subsequent reshuffles, particularly in July 2016 and September 2017, further expanded the Council. By July 7, 2021, the Council had 77 members, including 36 new faces and 7 promotions to Cabinet rank.Post the 2019 elections, Modis second term started with 58 ministers. This included 24 Cabinet Ministers, 9 Ministers of State with independent charge, and 25 Ministers of State. As of March 20, 2024, the Council had 29 Cabinet Ministers, 3 Ministers of State with independent charge, and 42 Ministers of State.Balancing Coalition AlliesEffective governance and appeasing coalition allies will be a priority. Key allies like the Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) will be pivotal in this term. The BJPs largest alliance partners include the TDP and JD(U), with 16 and 12 seats respectively.With these constitutional limitations, the strategic distribution of ministries to keep allies satisfied while ensuring effective governance will be closely monitored by political analysts and the public.", "summary": "Narendra Modi is set to be sworn in as Prime Minister for a third consecutive term at 7:15 pm at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on June 9.

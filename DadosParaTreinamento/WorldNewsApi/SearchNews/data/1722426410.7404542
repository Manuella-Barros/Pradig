Following a series of maintenance exercises undertaken by the project contractor, traffic can now traverse the Linden-Mabura roadway with fair ease, a release from the ministry said yesterday.. Road users are still encouraged to exercise caution while traversing this area since works are still ongoing to complete the upgrading of the carriageway. The Linden-Mabura Road Project which commenced in 2023, is expected to be completed in 2025, and will see 121 km of paved road, which will bring relief to an estimated 50,000 Guyanese who transport goods from the coast to the interior regions of Guyana, the release said.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/news/guyana/impassable-sections-of-linden-mabura-road-repaired-ministry/\" title=\"Impassable sections of Linden-Mabura Road repaired \u2013 ministry\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"1066\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-1066x800.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 15px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-1066x800.jpg 1066w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-666x500.jpg 666w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-1200x901.jpg 1200w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch-133x100.jpg 133w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/re", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/news/guyana/impassable-sections-of-linden-mabura-road-repaired-ministry/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/repaired-stretch.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:08:58", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": 0.129}

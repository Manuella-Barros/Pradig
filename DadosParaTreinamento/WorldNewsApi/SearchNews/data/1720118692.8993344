The Three Lions face Bosnia-Herzegovina at St James\u2019 Park on Monday night in one of two friendlies as Gareth Southgate settles on his final squad for this summer\u2019s extravaganza. They then entertain Iceland at Wembley on Friday with the emphasis on two comprehensive victories to send the side across the channel in the very best of spirits. England, who face Serbia, Slovenia and Euro 2022 semi-final opponents Denmark in the group stages which start in a fortnight, were unbeaten in qualification but were less than convincing in their two friendlies in March \u2013 losing 1-0 to Brazil before a late Jude Bellingham strike salvaged a 2-2 draw with Belgium. Those efforts must be improved upon and England\u2019s build-up could also do with Manchester United making a swift decision about Erik Ten Hag\u2019s future. Southgate\u2019s name has been linked with the job \u2013 he\u2019s the 8/1 third favourite with William Hill and Betfair \u2013 and the longer it takes the Old Trafford board to offer clarification, the greater the distraction for the Football Association and the Three Lions camp.

It\u2019s the ideal opportunity for Southgate to run the rule over the fringe players battling to book their flights to Germany and that means a trio of Crystal Palace stars being given a start with Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and Marc Guehi trying to impress after finishing the season strongly with Eagles. Eberechi Eze has the skills to make the Three Lions squad (Picture: CameraSport via Getty Images) It will be interesting to see if Harry Kane starts as he is in need of playing time after missing the last couple of weeks of Bayern Munich\u2019s Bundesliga season with a back injury. But it may be that he is kept on the bench until Friday so Ollie Watkins can show what he can do in the spotlight and the Aston Villa striker is 3/1 with BoyleSports, Bet Victor, Sky Bet and William Hill to open scoring and 3/4 with Ladbrokes and Coral to hit the net at any time. Eze is 9/5 with Bet Victor to get on the scoresheet and a 4-0 romp is 9/1 with Paddy Power, Betfair and BoyleSports. \u2022 Alexander Zverev, our ante-post selection, is 7/5 with BetUK and Unibet to make French Open progress by beating Holger Rune by over 5.5 games as the second week at Roland Garros gets underway.

However, we cannot ignore the significant humanitarian needs that remain and that cannot be addressed without adequate funding to respond.\n\nEconomic decline, deteriorating public services and infrastructure and displacement induced by conflict and climate-related disasters continue to drive the humanitarian crisis. Rising food insecurity, the risk of increasing malnutrition rates - particularly among pregnant and lactating women, older people and children - and the spread of cholera during the current rainy season, pose threats to communities across the country. Violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law continue, and the presence of explosive remnants of war results in death, injury and displacement, restricts access to agricultural land and resettlement and hinders post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts.\n\nFunding for a focused and well-prioritized 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan must be ensured to sustain the gains made and prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. To date, only $435 million of Yemen's 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan requirement of $2.7 billion has been funded-leaving unmet requirements of $2.3 billion. Underfunding poses a challenge to the continuity of humanitarian programming, causing delays, reductions and suspensions of lifesaving assistance programmes. These challenges directly affect the lives of millions who depend on humanitarian assistance and protection services for survival.\n\nHumanitarian partners are committed to transforming the response in Yemen and reducing humanitarian needs. As partners, together, we will continue to improve the quality of humanitarian assistance and maximize impact with targeted, quality programming based on need. Partners will expand collaboration with development actors and promote more Yemeni leadership for a locally-led and locally informed response, to help Yemenis rebuild their futures. To do so, however, humanitarian partners' sustained support is required.\n\nInaction would have catastrophic consequences for the lives of Yemeni women, children and men. The Sixth Senior Officials Meeting is a critical moment to galvanize support and collective action to address the deteriorating crisis. The humanitarian community appeals to donors to urgently address existing funding gaps, and provide sustainable support to enhance resilience and reduce aid dependency.", "source": {"uri": "nrc.no", "dataType": "news", "title": "NRC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unexploded ordnance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International human rights law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cholera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wet season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dependent territory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.nrc.no/image/305236/en_joint-statement.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542978", "eventUri": "eng-9542978", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

need, warning of \"catastrophic consequences\" if funding gaps persist.\n\nIn a joint statement, the UN agencies, international NGOs, and Yemeni civil society groups said only 400 million U.S. dollars of the 2.7 billion dollars required for the 2024 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan have been delivered so far this year.\n\n\"More than half of Yemen's population, or 18.2 million people, including 14 million women and children, require humanitarian assistance and protection services after nine years of conflict,\" the statement said.\n\nIt added that the humanitarian community in Yemen continues to provide one of the world's largest aid operations despite an \"extremely difficult and complex\" environment.\n\nHowever, the lack of funding is posing a severe challenge, forcing delays, reductions, and suspensions of life-saving programs that millions depend upon to survive in the country.\n\n\"Failure to act will have catastrophic consequences for the lives of Yemeni women, children, and men,\" the groups warned ahead of a donor meeting to be held in Brussels on Tuesday.\n\nThat meeting, hosted by the European Union, represents \"a crucial moment to mobilize support and collective action\" for addressing Yemen's deteriorating humanitarian crisis, they said.\n\nYemen has been embroiled in a civil war since late 2014, when the Houthi group seized control of the capital Sanaa, triggering a Saudi-led military intervention months later.\n\nThe conflict has sparked the world's worst humanitarian crisis, according to the UN, with millions being displaced and facing famine, disease outbreaks, and a severe lack of basic services after years of bombing and economic collapse. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title":

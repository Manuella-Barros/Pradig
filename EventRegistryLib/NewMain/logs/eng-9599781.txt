The bodies were charred beyond recognition. The DNA samples of the bodies and the victim's relatives have been collected for identification of the deceased, they said.\n\nFour children under the age of 12 were among the 27 persons killed in the massive fire that swept through a game zone teeming with people enjoying a summer vacation outing on Saturday evening, as per the officials.

The Prime Minister has sought the information of the incident from the Chief Minister and has expressed grief. The PM has directed that strong action be taken against the culprits.\n\nThe five-member SIT formed by the State Government, to conduct a probe into the incident and submit a report within 72 hours, reached Rajkot late Saturday night and held a meeting with the local administration.\n\nAdditional Director General of Police Subhash Trivedi, who heads the SIT said the inquiry will begin immediately to find out those responsible for it and ensure no such incident is repeated in the future. \"We will go through all the aspects of the incident and investigate them thoroughly -- We will work with commitment and complete honesty and integrity to provide justice to the children who have lost their lives,\" Trivedi said.\n\n\"The bodies are charred beyond recognition, and we have completed the process of collecting the DNA samples of the bodies and the relatives who have claimed them so that the identity of the deceased can be established. The death toll is not likely to rise any further,\" he said.\n\nThe exact cause of the massive fire is not yet known. The CM has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to each injured.\n\nIn the wake of the fire tragedy, the state director general of police has issued instructions to the commissioners of police and superintendents of police to inspect all the game zones in Gujarat and close those running without fire safety permission.\n\nThe Gujarat High Court bench directed advocates of the Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot municipal corporations to appear before it on Monday with instructions as to under what provisions of law the authorities led these units to be set up or continue to operate under their jurisdiction.\n\n\"We are shocked to read newspaper reports which indicate that the gaming zone at Rajkot appears to have taken advantage of the loopholes in the Gujarat Comprehensive General Development Control Regulations (GDCR).

The HC on Sunday took suo motu cognisance of the fire tragedy, terming it a prima facie \"man-made disaster\".\n\nOn Monday, a counsel pointed out that the unfortunate incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state government will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps.\n\nThe court then said, \"Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,\" the court observed.\n\nTo the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied to the authorities for requisite permissions, the court asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\n\n\"You were blind to that, that this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of the entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?\" the court said.\n\nThe HC also wanted to know when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then?

It had also submitted a proof of fire safety equipment to obtain the fire NOC, which was under process and not yet completed,\" Rajkot Police Commissioner Raju Bhargava told reporters on Sunday.\n\nThe fire at the TRP game zone in the Nana-Mava locality of Rajkot on Saturday evening killed 27 persons, including children.\n\nThe police have arrested two persons and registered an FIR against six partners of the game zone and another accused on various charges, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, officials earlier said.\n\nIn the Gujarat High Court, a special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked the Rajkot Municipal Corporation whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC's lawyer submitted that the TRP game zone had not asked for requisite permissions.\n\nThe court said the state machinery gets into action only after innocent lives are lost.\n\nThe HC was hearing a suo motu PIL on the deadly fire. Earlier, it had called it a \"man-made disaster\".\n\nThe court also observed on Monday that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred\", and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\nThe game zone was operated without the fire NOC (no objection certificate), as per officials.\n\nOn Monday, a counsel pointed out that the incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps.\n\nThe court then said, \"Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,\" the court observed.\n\nTo the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied to the authorities for requisite permissions, the court asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\n\n\"You were blind to that, that this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?\" the court said.\n\nThe HC also wanted to know when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?\" the bench asked.\n\nIt directed the incumbent RMC commissioner and officers who held the municipal commissioner's post from July 2021 till the date of the incident to file affidavits before the court, explaining various issues regarding certificates on the structural stability of such constructions, etc.\n\n\"We refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance of the direction of this court. We do not do so with the hope to give them a chance,\" the bench further said.\n\nThe HC also directed chief fire officers of the Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot municipal corporations to file affidavits on the fire safety measures (in areas of their jurisdiction), such as installation of fire hydrants, checking of fire safety equipment, whether licences (to operate) were obtained from the respective collectorates or mamlatdars.\n\nThe state has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased. The Central government has also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has demanded that senior civic and state officials and office-bearers of the ruling BJP be named in the FIR registered in the Rajkot game zone fire, stressing that action against junior-level employees is meaningless.

The game zone operated without necessary fire safety approvals, leading to the tragic incident.\n\nThe Gujarat government on Monday suspended six officials in connection with the loss of 27 lives in the Rajkot game zone fire, even as the Gujarat High Court said it had no faith in the state machinery, which gets into action only when innocent lives are lost.\n\nThe suspended officials have been held responsible for their \"gross negligence in allowing the game zone to operate without necessary approvals\", a government release stated.\n\nThose suspended are Rajkot Municipal Corporation's town planning department assistant engineer Jaideep Chaudhary, assistant town planner for RMC Gautam Joshi, Rajkot Roads and Buildings department's deputy executive engineers MR Suma and Paras Kothiya, and police inspectors VR Patel and NI Rathod, as per orders passed by the respective departments.\n\nNotably, the game zone, where the blaze erupted on Saturday, was operated without the fire NOC (no objection certificate).\n\n\"The game zone had received permissions from the roads and buildings department. It had also submitted a proof of fire safety equipment to obtain the fire NOC, which was under process and not yet completed,'' Rajkot Police Commissioner Raju Bhargava told reporters on Sunday.\n\nThe fire at the TRP game zone in the Nana-Mava locality of Rajkot on Saturday evening killed 27 persons, including children.\n\nThe police have arrested two persons and registered an FIR against six partners of the game zone and another accused on various charges, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, officials earlier said.\n\nIn the Gujarat High Court, a special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked the Rajkot Municipal Corporation whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC's lawyer submitted that the TRP game zone had not asked for requisite permissions.\n\nThe court said the state machinery gets into action only after innocent lives are lost.\n\nThe HC was hearing a suo motu PIL on the deadly fire. Earlier, it had called it a \"man-made disaster\".\n\nThe court also observed on Monday that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred\", and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\nThe game zone was operated without the fire NOC (no objection certificate), as per officials.\n\nOn Monday, a counsel pointed out that the incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps.\n\nThe court then said, \"Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,'' the court observed.\n\nTo the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied to the authorities for requisite permissions, the court asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\n\n\"You were blind to that, that this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?\" the court said.\n\nThe HC also wanted to know when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?'' the bench asked.\n\nIt directed the incumbent RMC commissioner and officers who held the municipal commissioner's post from July 2021 till the date of the incident to file affidavits before the court, explaining various issues regarding certificates on the structural stability of such constructions, etc.\n\n\"We refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance of the direction of this court. We do not do so with the hope to give them a chance,'' the bench further said.\n\nThe HC also directed chief fire officers of the Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot municipal corporations to file affidavits on the fire safety measures (in areas of their jurisdiction), such as installation of fire hydrants, checking of fire safety equipment, whether licences (to operate) were obtained from the respective collectorates or mamlatdars. The state has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased. The Central government has also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person. Meanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has demanded that senior civic and state officials and office-bearers of the ruling BJP be named in the FIR registered in the Rajkot game zone fire, stressing that action against junior-level employees is meaningless.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

The court had taken a suo motu cognizance of Rajkot game zone fire on Sunday, calling it a man-made disaster.\n\nThe TRP game zone was set up in 2021. The fire at the TRP game zone in the Nana-Mava locality of Rajkot on Saturday evening had killed 27 persons, including children. The game zone was operated without the fire NOC (no objection certificate), as per officials.\n\nThe court reportedly pulled up the Rajkot Municipal Corporation on the Monday over the incident. and asked whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC's lawyer submitted that the TRP game zone had not asked for requisite permissions.\n\nDuring the hearing on Monday, a counsel said the fire incident at the gaming zone required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state government will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps.\n\nALSO READ: Rajkot gaming zone fire: Seven officials including police inspectors, civic staff suspended for negligence | Top Updates\n\nThe court was then quoted by PTI as saying, \"Who will take such drastic steps?

What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of the entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?\" the court was quoted by PTI as saying.\n\nThe high court also wanted to know when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do?

The court took notice of the fact that like Rajkot, such gaming zones have mushroomed in Ahmedabad, from Sidhu Bhavan Road to SG Highway and SP Ring Road, \"which pose significant threat to public safety, especially innocent children\".\n\nOn the issue of loopholes in CGDCR, HC directed the municipal corporations to show whether the gaming zones operating under their respective jurisdictions had undertaken compliance of fire safety regulations.\n\nPresident of Gujarat HC Advocates' Association, Brijesh Trivedi, and advocate Amit Panchal, who demanded HC's intervention in this matter, appeared before the court and drew the court's attention on how a stock of inflammable material was kept carelessly at the gaming zone in Rajkot.

A day earlier, the HC termed the incident a prima facie \"man-made disaster\".\n\nThe bench asked whether the civic body had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity after its lawyer submitted that the TRP Game Zone had not asked for requisite permissions.\n\nThe bench noted that all commissioners of the Rajkot municipal corporation from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred,\" and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\nOn Monday, a counsel pointed out the state government will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps.\n\n\"Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,\" the bench said.\n\nTo the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied for requisite permissions, the HC asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\n\n\"You were blind to that...this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of the entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?,\" the bench asked.\n\nThe HC also wanted to know as to when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of the inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?\" the bench asked.\n\nThe court noted the game zone was conceptualised in 2021 and continued to operate till May 5, 2024, for over a period of three years, admitted without a fire NOC or any other requisite permissions. On May 9, 2024, the corporation wrote to the owners to furnish fire NOC, it stated in the order.\n\nThe question is \"inaction of the authorities in even inspecting the site in light of the regulations,\" it said and questioned why the civic body didn't inquire about the legality of the structures for 3 years since June 2021.\n\n\"On the date when the incident occurred, the game zone did not have NOCs or structural stability certificate, and it was merrily going on in front of the corporation,\" the bench stated.\n\nOwners of the TRP Game Zone created a fabricated steel frame structure with the boundaries of steel patras, the HC said. It did not have a fire NOC and structural stability certificate, and was asked to provide the same in order to get the benefit of regularisation, the court noted.\n\n\"The facts itself are eloquent, therefore, to indicate that the game zone at Rajkot was conceptualised, set up and continued to operate under the very nose of the corporation's officials without the requisite permissions,\" it observed in its order.\n\nWe refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance with the direction of this court. We do not do so with the hope to give them a chance, the bench added.\n\nThe bench said the structures set up by the game zone operator cannot be branded as \"temporary structures.\" The bench stated even the police department has \"a lot to answer '' for allowing the game zone to operate in the vicinity of a local police station with fire NOC permission and directed the Rajkot Police Commissioner to file an affidavit.\n\nThe bench noted that the AMC, SMC, and VMC swung into action \"in a typical knee-jerk reaction\" after the Rajkot incident and inspected such entertainment zones. \"It was most unfortunate that they acted only after the death of innocent children and young ones,\" the bench stated.\n\nThe HC asked whether the SIT formed by the state will \"sufficiently assuage the sentiments of the families who have repeatedly lost their kith and kin in these tragedies which have obviously been man-made.\" PTI KA PD GK NSK", "source": {"uri": "newsdrum.in", "dataType": "news",

Photograph: Amit Dave/Reuters\n\nThe court pulled up the Rajkot Municipal Corporation and asked whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC's lawyer submitted that the TRP game zone had not asked for requisite permissions.\n\nA special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai was hearing a suo motu PIL on the game zone fire incident.\n\nThe court also observed that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred,\" and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\nThe fire at the TRP game zone in the Nana-Mava locality of Rajkot on Saturday evening killed 27 persons, including children.\n\nThe game zone was operated without the fire NOC (no objection certificate), as per officials.\n\nThe HC on Sunday took suo motu cognisance of the fire tragedy, terming it a prima facie \"man-made disaster\".\n\nOn Monday, a counsel pointed out that the unfortunate incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state government will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps.\n\nThe court then said, \"Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,\" the court observed.\n\nTo the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied to the authorities for requisite permissions, the court asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\n\n\"You were blind to that, that this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?\" the court said.\n\nThe HC also wanted to know when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?\" the bench asked.\n\nThe court also observed that all the municipal commissioners, right from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred,\" and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\n\"We refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance of the direction of this court. We do not do so with the hope to give them a chance,\" the bench further said.\n\nIt directed the incumbent RMC commissioner and officers who held the municipal commissioner's post from July 2021 till the date of the incident to file affidavits before the court, explaining various issues regarding certificates on the structural stability of such constructions, etc.\n\nThe HC also directed chief fire officers of the Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot municipal corporations to file affidavits on the fire safety measures (in areas of their jurisdiction), such as installation of fire hydrants, checking of fire safety equipment, whether licences (to operate) were obtained from the respective collectorates or mamlatdars.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The gaming zone operators had reportedly not taken the mandatory permissions and licences from the Rajkot Municipal Corporation. \"All this was going on for two-and-a-half years, so did you fall asleep? Or did you go blind,\" the court scolded the officials.\n\nWhen the RMC informed the court that the gaming zone did not ask for permission, the bench pointed out it was their responsibility too. \"Even after four years of our order, if no steps were taken in the matter of fire safety, then how is the RMC not responsible?\" it said.\n\nThe Rajkot civic body was also hauled over the coals by the court after photographs of officials at the gaming zone came to light. \"What were these officers doing there?

The facility lacked a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the fire department and had only one entry-exit point, which contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed under the leadership of Joint CP Vidhi Chowdhary to probe the incident thoroughly and a hunt is on for nabbing the other four accused, said the CP.\n\nAccording to police, the gaming facility had been granted a booking license in November 2023 and subsequently renewed to operate from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n\n\"While the gaming zone owners had submitted bills to the police for fire safety equipment and claimed to have installed such equipment on the premises, the measures taken were inadequate and ineffective in controlling the situation...Th process for obtaining the necessary Fire NOC (No Objection Certificate) was underway but had not been completed when the tragic incident took place,\" Bhargav told media persons in Rajkot on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe TRP Gaming Zone witnessed an overwhelming influx of visitors due to a tempting discount scheme, where the entry fee was slashed from \u20b9500 to just \u20b999, aimed at attracting more people during the holiday and weekend period.\n\nAt least 40 persons were rescued from the site, according to Bhargav. The process of DNA matching for the 27 recovered bodies is currently underway at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Gandhinagar. The deceased included four children.\n\nIn an attempt to circumvent municipal approvals, the gaming zone was established in a shed structure, and a three-storey facility was subsequently set up. \"The fire is likely to have started from a welding spark on a ladder. With only one available staircase, visitors on the second and third floors found themselves trapped, leading to a higher number of casualties,\" said a person aware of the matter.\n\nThere was stock of highly inflammable materials such as fuel and tyres, fiber glass shades, thermocol sheet partitions; some of these were for go-carting and all these created an extremely combustible environment, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nPolice said a first information report (FIR) has been registered against the six accused individuals under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 114 (abettor present when offense is committed) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gujarat High Court on Sunday took suo motu cognizance of the incident based on newspaper reports. Expressing shock over the loss of innocent lives, a division bench comprising justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan M Desai ordered the Registry to register a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) in the matter.\n\nThe court observed that prima facie, it looked like a \"man-made disaster\", where many lives have been lost.\n\nThe court has directed the panel advocates of the Ahmedabad, Baroda, Surat, and Rajkot Municipal Corporations as well as the additional advocate general of the State of Gujarat to appear before it on Monday with instructions on the provisions of law under which these gaming zones and recreational facilities were allowed to be set up and operated.\n\nThe court questioned whether the necessary licenses, including compliance with fire safety regulations, were undertaken by these gaming zones within the territorial jurisdiction of these corporations.\n\nThe court observed, \"Prima-facie, a man-made disaster has occurred where many lives have been lost and families have grieved today for the loss of lives in their respective families.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced ex-gratia of \u20b92 lakh from the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF) for the next of kin of each deceased.

The gender of three bodies could not be determined due to severe burns, while only partial remains of one person were recovered. Forensic experts are now tasked with the challenge of identifying the victims through DNA analysis, a process that could take up to seven days. This step is crucial for providing closure to grieving families. A forensic team has arrived in Rajkot to collect samples from the site.\n\nFew hours back, Rajkot police commissioner Raju Bhargava was transferred. He will be replaced by IPS officer Brijesh Kumar Jha.\n\nThe government has also transferred additional commissioner of police of Rajkot (Administration, traffic and crime) Vidhi Choudhary along with Sudhirkumar J Desai, DCP-zone 2.Poll\n\nThe decision comes hours after the high court rapped Gujarat government earlier on Monday saying it does not have faith in the state machinery \"which gets into action only after innocent lives are lost\". A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked whether the civic body sat over the fire safety orders passed earlier on a PIL for 18 months.\n\nThe bench held that all Rajkot municipal commissioners from the time the game zone was established in 2021 until the tragedy occurred on May 25 \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred.\n\n\"To the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied for requisite permissions, the HC asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\"You were blind to that...this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of the entertainment tax?

Gujarat High Court questions Rajkot civic body", "body": "Says it does not have faith in the State machinery which gets into action only after innocent lives are lost\n\nAhmedabad: The Gujarat High Court on Monday came down heavily on the Rajkot civic body over the game zone fire which left 27 persons dead, and said it does not have faith in the State machinery which gets into action only after innocent lives are lost.\n\nThe court pulled up the Rajkot Municipal Corporation and asked whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC's lawyer submitted that the TRP game zone had not asked for requisite permissions. A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai was hearing a suo motu PIL on the game zone fire incident.\n\nThe court also observed that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred,\" and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\nThe fire at the TRP game zone in the Nana-Mava locality of Rajkot on Saturday evening killed 27 persons, including children. The game zone was operated without the fire NOC (no objection certificate), as per officials. The HC on Sunday took suo motu cognisance of the fire tragedy, terming it a prima facie \"man-made disaster.\"\n\nOn Monday, a counsel pointed out that the unfortunate incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state government will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps. The court then said, \"Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,\" the court observed.\n\nTo the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied to the authorities for requisite permissions, the court asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction.\n\n\"You were blind to that, that this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?\" the court said.\n\nThe HC also wanted to know when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone. \"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?\" the Bench asked.\n\nThe court also observed that all the municipal commissioners, right from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred,\" and directed them to furnish separate affidavits.\n\n\"We refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance of the direction of this court.

Gujarat high court raps Rajkot civic body over gaming zone fire | Rajkot News - Times of India", "body": "NEW DELHI: The Gujarat high court on Monday came down heavily on the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) over the tragic game zone fire that claimed 28 lives.\n\nThe court also expressed its lack of faith in the state machinery, which only takes action after innocent lives are lost.\n\nThe RMC's lawyer informed the court that the TRP game zone had not sought the necessary permissions, prompting the court to question whether the civic body had turned a blind eye to the construction of such a large structure within its jurisdiction.\n\nA special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai, hearing a suo motu PIL on the incident.\n\nThe bench held that all Rajkot municipal commissioners from the time the game zone was established in 2021 until the tragedy occurred on May 25 \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred.\" The court ordered them to submit separate affidavits.\n\nThe court also questioned the RMC's awareness of the game zone's existence, asking whether they were completely ignorant of the structure for the past two-and-a-half years.\n\n\"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?\" the bench asked.\n\nThe bench inquired about the corporation's actions regarding fire safety, entertainment tax, and compliance with the court's previous orders on fire safety measures.\n\n\"We refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance of the direction of this court. We do not do so with the hope to give them a chance,\" the bench further said.\n\nThe HC directed the current RMC commissioner and officers who held the position from July 2021 until the date of the incident to file affidavits explaining various issues related to structural stability certificates and other relevant matters. Additionally, the chief fire officers of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, and Rajkot municipal corporations were ordered to file affidavits on fire safety measures within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nThe TOI City Desk is an indefatigable team of journalists dedicated to bringing you the pulse of cities from across the nation, all day and all night.

Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now after four years of orders passed by this court, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost, only then do they trigger the machinery.\"\n\nAdvocate G H Virk, appearing for RMC, informed the court that the original land owners only applied for regularisation on May 9 and had reportedly been operating the area for go-karting earlier, the activities starting sometime in June-July 2021.\n\nTo this, Justice Vaishnav asked, \"So you were ignorant of these structures existing in the vicinity? So you were blind to it, that these big structures existed, you were unaware of it for 18 months? Was fire safety applied for it? Did you inspect? We'll take it that you're completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue. When did the corporation first recognise the existence of such a game zone? There are media reports that your corporation commissioner went for the inauguration. For 18 months, what did the corporation do? On the day of the incident, there was no fire NOC, no structural stability certificate and it was merrily going on, in front of the corporation's eyes.\"\n\nJustice Desai added, \"For three years you did not inquire about the structure or its legality. Forget they did not apply. What are your duties (as a civic body)? Who is the officer in charge in this period? You could have ordered the closure of the game zone till the regularisation... If someone doesn't seek permission for two or three years, will the corporation shut its eyes?\"\n\n\"Why should the commissioner not be held accountable for not complying with orders (of Gujarat HC concerning ensuring fire safety) for the last four years? Blatant, under the nose of the commissioner, admittedly by the state now, that the gaming zone is running for 18 months.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Gujarat Government, represented by Additional Advocate General Manisha Lavkumar Shah, informed the court it has framed draft rules for regulating boating, which also includes regulating amusement zones/parks, framed in the aftermath of the Harni boat capsize in which 14 people, including 12 children, were killed earlier this year under the directions from the High Court.\n\nShah said, as of date, all amusement/gaming zones have been closed across the state and that the SIT formed to look into the incident is expected to submit a preliminary report either on Monday or Tuesday.

Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of inauguration.\n\nWe can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do?

It sounds great on paper, a huge boost in productivity and revenue, but many organizations find themselves now struggling to make this their reality. The proliferation of generative AI tools has captured the imagination of consumers and companies alike, but have we overstated the actual impact of AI on innovation and business benefits?\n\nFor the past year, we've watched tech companies embark on a race for AI dominance: rushing to showcase new enterprise AI solutions, rebranding existing technology with an AI lens, and touting the business benefits of various AI tools. However, a new global study of 1,700 senior decision-makers finds that the promise of AI is being held back. Although they acknowledge that AI is expected to deliver high-impact value in product and service innovation, improve data availability, and reduce costs, they feel significant pressure to adopt AI quickly and worry about the potential failure of the AI bubble.\n\nIt's clear that many organizations have been captivated by the shiny new toy that is generative AI, but they aren't prioritizing the necessary aspects of development and infrastructure required to reap the rewards that were promised. Without these critical elements, organizations simply aren't prepared to scale AI adoption across their business.\n\nWhere AI Adoption Is Now\n\nConsidering it's the home of industry leaders like OpenAI, the AI \"bubble\" is most prominent in the U.S. - but, despite AI's domineering presence, the country has fallen furthest behind in bridging the gap from AI hype to adoption. Across global markets, the study above reveals that France seems to be spearheading AI adoption, with over a third (36%) of organizations already having a clear AI strategy and perceivable results. On the other hand, those in North America were the least likely (21%) to have a clear AI strategy in place, citing ethical and security concerns as the main factors impacting their AI adoption and deployment progress.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, organizations in Construction & Engineering are leading the way, with 31% having a clear AI strategy and perceivable results, compared to just under a quarter (24%) of those in the Aerospace & Defense sector who said the same. Strikingly, just 1% of organizations across all industries said nothing is slowing their progress in adopting and deploying AI, meaning 99% are facing a challenge that's holding back AI innovation.\n\nThe delay from existing AI hype to impactful AI adoption comes down to a few key aspects: skillsets and resources, legacy tech impediments, and a lack of data readiness. AI is still so new that many organizations simply don't have the skills needed to develop and operate AI tools. Furthermore, many industries are still using legacy tech that isn't conducive to creating an AI-ready workforce. Digital transformation is still in progress at many companies, and they don't yet have the modern, cloud-based architecture that is ideally suited for AI.\n\nWhere to Go Next\n\nAs tech-forward companies continue to make breakthroughs in AI, the pressure is on for other industries to catch up. More than four in five (84%) decision-makers agree that the business at large holds high expectations for AI, noting the pressure to adopt AI quickly, but without a clear strategy.\n\nFor leaders struggling to articulate an AI strategy or move towards AI adoption, the first step in overcoming the hurdle is to identify the challenges they're facing. The most common factors slowing progress differ depending on where a company is in its AI journey:\n\nAs long as businesses can take that first step, the promised land of increased productivity and more effective operational management is not far away. With the right combination of cloud, data, processes, and skills in place, AI can offer a slew of benefits, including proactive insight delivery to improve processes, increased personalization for customer experiences, anomaly detection, performance monitoring, asset management, and automation.\n\nWhile it may take months, or even years, to progress from ideating a strategy to seeing the full impact of AI on business outcomes, it's never too early to start strategizing. In fact, it's imperative to start as early as possible to avoid being left behind. The good news is that we're all figuring AI out together as the technology continues to develop.

However, opportunities presented by this wave of AI-enabled SaaS apps come with fresh problems.\n\nAccording to our research, in addition to SaaS bloat -- 55% of companies have more than 50 SaaS apps in their tech stack -- AI misalignment is poised to become a new problem. For each app in their stack, 57% of executives plan to use the provided AI functionality as part of their AI business process strategy. However, \"only 32% of practitioners and team leads state this will be the primary focus for their organization -- and almost 20% of practitioners state their organizations don't have an AI strategy as it relates to their tech stack and internal business processes.\"\n\nCompounding this is the fact that U.S. companies are still battling crippling technical debt. A 2022 report found it would require $1.52 trillion to fix this problem and cost U.S. companies \"$2.41 trillion a year in cybersecurity and operational failures, failed development projects, and maintenance of outdated systems.\"\n\nAI has the potential to both exacerbate and alleviate this issue. \"By 2027, 70% of professional developers will use AI-powered coding tools, up from less than 10% today,\" according to Gartner. On the other hand, implementing AI without clear direction or a solid ongoing management strategy will only create more technical debt.\n\nTo compete in the AI era, many companies are discovering the importance of transforming into autonomous enterprises by empowering teams to leverage AI for integrations and automation. Along with this, there's a growing need to continuously optimize workflows and deploy intelligent, iteratively learning knowledge agents.\n\nAmid the flood of AI-enabled SaaS apps, organizations face a critical question: How can they take their first steps toward sustainably harnessing AI's power and embark on the path to becoming an autonomous enterprise?\n\nI believe the real value of AI will be recognized when organizations start infusing it into new and existing business processes. As enterprises begin sketching out their AI implementation strategies, they must consider the following:\n\nThere are a lot of questions about how AI can be safely and securely enabled across the organization, especially in a tech landscape where almost every SaaS app now offers its own form of AI functionality. Responsibly deploying AI features requires a careful, well-thought-out approach and foundational technology that can serve as the epicenter of the enterprise AI strategy.\n\nOne external consideration is to adopt a platform that can become the control center for end-to-end business processes where precise decisions can be made about where and how to infuse AI for the best business outcomes. Additionally, organizations should focus on outlining clear AI policies, including data handling and data security requirements and the acceptable use of AI tools.\n\nBuild with a composable mindset to create more agile, flexible and efficient AI systems that can be quickly assembled and deployed to address evolving business needs. Prioritize tooling that can communicate well with all other applications in the tech stack, use tools with deep commitments to observability, and foster a culture of learning and experimentation with clear bounds that account for data governance.\n\nTo move beyond toys and experiments to real AI solutions, teams can begin by running robust self-evaluations on historical data and identifying when the organization is in beta on real-time AI processes. Leaders should then work to go beyond \"zero-shot\" AI projects, ensuring that AI can reflect on the work it has accomplished, rate the work completed, update it and complete it or escalate it to a human as necessary.\n\nOrganizations should stay nimble and avoid committing to any one AI vendor. The foundation model landscape has undergone significant change over the past year, with a wide range in price, latency and \"perceived intellect\" among the various models. By experimenting with multiple options, organizations can best prepare themselves to adopt the ideal model for each desired outcome.\n\nBy considering the points above, an organization can be better prepared to start experimenting with AI. While getting started can be daunting, there are three things companies can do to kickstart their initiatives.\n\nStart by looking at the organization and identifying where teams can easily solve an issue with AI. IT and customer service are two departments that can greatly and quickly benefit from AI and where an organization is likely to see more than just incremental efficiency gains. With exploration and internal team surveys, enterprises can identify clear opportunities across every department where they can begin the experimentation phase.\n\nAn organization's unstructured data holds incredible value, but often it's very difficult to use effectively. To capitalize on the coming AI wave, companies should create an internal knowledge agent that can be queried by staff if they need help with tasks, such as drafting responses to support tickets. This agent can also surface incorrect or outdated knowledge sources when incorrect or incomplete answers are rendered.\n\nThis initial exercise will help teams build their AI muscle and start thinking about organizing company data and prioritizing what data they want AI to have access to. Production AI agents must be underpinned by trustworthy data, and these steps will help with the process of cleaning and ingesting institutional knowledge.\n\nFinally, inject well-defined universal uses of AI -- text extraction, classification, summarization and so on -- within the workflows that teams are currently executing. Tracking AI usage across the organization will allow AI teams to refine their prompt engineering techniques and help bring AI knowledge and thinking to new teams.\n\nWith the advent of AI, organizations across all industries are going to reimagine every business process.

Companies eager to harness these benefits can leverage ready-made, budget-friendly models and customize them with proprietary business data to quickly tap into the power of AI.\n\nThe right generative AI solutions can unlock a world of opportunities for business leaders aiming to increase efficiency, drive productivity, and boost performance. But first, they need to consider where it fits in their organization, which processes will benefit the most, whether to buy or build it, and what it'll cost.\n\nBusiness leaders ready to embrace AI can consider these five key points.\n\nGenerative AI harnesses data, automates processes, and is reshaping the fundamental approach to businesses and job functions. Creating new insights from data lays the groundwork for a range of applications, from optimizing operations to driving innovation and creativity.\n\nEvery organization has specific datasets that are crucial to its operations. By using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enterprises can tap into their own data to build AI applications designed for their specific business needs. By connecting generative capabilities to carefully selected data sources, RAG enables customized generative AI deployment that can support workers in their job roles.\n\nTake healthcare, for instance. RAG-equipped generative AI can analyze patient data, summarize key points, and draft custom care plans to support physicians and improve the patient experience.\n\nBusiness leaders should decide whether to develop their own generative AI solution from scratch, implement a pre-built one, or fine-tune foundation models. Building a tailored solution might be the way forward if an organization has specific needs, unique data, or specialist knowledge, but this generally requires more time. If an enterprise needs AI functionality for general purpose tasks, purchasing it is often the better choice. Ready-made solutions can be set up faster and provide immediate value.\n\nIf there's flexibility in the timeline, creating a custom solution can provide greater value.But the skills required to develop in-house generative AI tools are specialized and in high demand, so getting the right people on board is a must. Additionally, connecting open-source solutions or foundation models to handpicked proprietary data with RAG can provide a shortcut to customized AI.\n\nIntegration with existing infrastructure systems also needs careful evaluation, as businesses must determine whether current vendors can adequately support them. A clear understanding of procurement processes and timelines can help prevent delays.\n\nWith in-house development, long-term costs associated with staffing, development, and maintenance can add up. These costs can be justifiable if the AI tool provides a distinct advantage. However, end-to-end in-house development might not be economically sensible if existing or off-the-shelf tools can perform similar functionalities.\n\nAI applications cut across industries and different business areas. Chatbots can transform customer service with prompt responses; translation features facilitate access to information in any language; and in software development, AI drives productivity by generating code comments and functions.\n\nTo increase the chances of AI success and reduce time to value, business leaders should select high-impact use cases for generative AI implementation. Consider the organization's specific needs, employee and customer pain points, and which processes are ripe for AI enhancement. To build consensus, it's helpful to gather feedback from stakeholders who will interact with AI systems to understand their needs and potential resistance points.\n\nLearn and build confidence with pilot projects that can reveal how well AI integrates with existing systems and how significant improvements are. Consider whether the solution can be scaled across the organization to maximize impact. For example, can a customer service bot supporting call center staff be connected to a different data source to support the sales team, too?\n\nTo more quickly identify use cases and develop an implementation plan, consider consulting with AI experts or technology providers who can share peer examples and help pinpoint areas where AI can provide the most value.\n\nSuccessful AI implementation requires investment in infrastructure, expertise, software components, the collection of necessary data, and ongoing maintenance.\n\nBut not every company has to start from zero. Many opt for pre-trained or foundation models, which are more economical to train. These models only require customization with business-specific data and the implementation of brand guidelines. Although initial costs can be high, with expected improvements in efficiency and innovation, executives are enthusiastic about AI adoption.\n\nAs generative AI becomes more encompassing, it must be used safely and responsibly. Guardrail tools and data governance for large language models (LLMs) ensure that AI systems adhere to intended functions and prevent deviations. They help set boundaries in several areas:\n\nGenerative AI boosts innovation, efficiency, and problem-solving capabilities while managing risk.

We also discuss the key steps that corporate leaders and organisations can take to identify and address risks associated with the development, adoption and use of AI.\n\nWhile there are various laws and regulations that apply to AI technologies in Australia, there is currently no federal AI-specific regulatory framework that addresses its particular risks and challenges.\n\nBut that may not be the case for long: in January of 2024, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources released its interim response to its consultation on \"Safe and Responsible AI in Australia\", which indicates the government intends to introduce regulation for certain uses of AI. The response follows a discussion paper released in June 2023, which received 510 written submissions from interested stakeholders on the approach that should be taken to AI regulation in Australia.\n\nThe response identifies that the government's attention will be particularly focused on taking a balanced approach, ensuring the development and deployment of AI systems in Australia in legitimate (but high-risk) settings is safe and can be relied upon while ensuring the use of AI in low-risk settings can continue largely unimpeded.\n\nThe government's immediate focus will be on determining whether mandatory safeguards are the appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim. If so, the next step will be to determine how to implement these safeguards (through existing laws or new regulations).\n\nIt remains unclear what scope of \"high-risk\" applications of AI will be regulated. The government's discussion paper sought feedback on a definition that focused on impacts of AI that were \"systematic, irreversible or perpetual\" (e.g. the use of AI-enabled robots for medical surgery and AI in self-driving cars to make real-time decisions, as compared to a lower-risk application of screening parcels). The response did not confirm whether the government would proceed with this definition but noted similar approaches to regulating high-risk applications in the EU.\n\nThe government indicated that it will, in the short term:\n\nThe interim response follows other recent developments in AI regulation in Australia. These include:\n\nWhat's happening overseas?\n\nAI regulation in Australia has been evolving alongside the rapidly growing momentum of regulation in international jurisdictions.\n\nKey recent developments include:\n\nThe EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) is the world's first comprehensive AI law. It commenced on 1 August 2024, and takes effect over a 2-year transition period, with exceptions for high-risk AI systems and general-purpose AI models already placed on the market.\n\nThe EU AI Act takes a risk-based approach to regulating the entire AI lifecycle and establishes obligations for various operators in the AI value chain. It categorises AI systems into four risk categories: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk and minimal risk. Most of the obligations imposed on developers (defined in the EU AI Act as 'providers') of high-risk AI systems (for example, medical devices and critical infrastructure management tools).\n\nGeneral purpose AI models, being models that have a wide range of applications such as large language models (for example, GPT-4), are dealt with separately under the EU AI Act. Additional obligations apply to general purpose AI models with 'systemic risk'.\n\nSimilar to the EU GDPR, the EU AI Act applies extraterritorially (including, in some cases, to Australian organisations) and sets out large sanctions for non-compliance (including fines of up to \u20ac35 million or 7% of global turnover, depending on the infringement and size of the company).\n\nThe US does not have any overarching AI regulation and AI technology in the US is currently governed by a patchwork of federal and state laws and guidance.\n\nAt a federal level, President Biden issued an Executive Order on 30 October 2023 to define an approach to AI adoption and usage for the US government and federal agencies, with the goal of ensuring the \"safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence\".\n\nKey features of the sweeping order include:\n\nThe US Congress has also hosted hearings and working groups in both the Senate and House to address AI-related issues, including in relation to intellectual property and national security.\n\nAt a state level, a number of legislatures have passed legislation relating to AI issues, including to improve transparency (including for users to understand when they are interacting with an AI model and the datasets used to train models), address sector-specific issues (such as use of AI models in making employment decisions) and other general AI issues (including requiring impact assessments).\n\nChina has been an early mover in AI regulation and has introduced a suite of regulations for specific AI applications since 2021. However, China has not yet implemented overarching AI regulation.\n\nRegulations introduced include laws addressing:\n\nChina continues to release and publish further standards for public consultation (including recent standards released for data security and content regulation of generative AI).\n\nWhere to next?\n\nIt is important to remember that while Australia does not yet have AI-specific laws, there are existing technology-neutral laws that apply to organisations developing, supplying or using AI systems, as well as the directors, senior executives and key personnel of such organisations. These include laws relating to privacy, consumer protection, copyright, work health and safety, anti-discrimination and directors' duties, as well as sector-specific laws such as those regulating financial services and entities responsible for critical infrastructure.\n\nAustralian organisations that have an international connection, including in the EU, could also be caught by the extraterritorial reach of applicable foreign laws.\n\nGiven the rapidly evolving regulatory and policy positions in Australia and overseas, and increased focus in this area by governments, regulators and the public, key steps that corporate leaders and organisations in Australia can take include:\n\nThis will likely simplify compliance with existing laws and any future AI regulation in Australia and help organisations build and maintain trust with their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [],

The global study Industrial AI: the new frontier for productivity, innovation and competition involved 1,700 senior decision makers from Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Aerospace & Defense, Services, Construction & Engineering, and Energy & Resources companies. It found that optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is a direct indicator of AI strategy maturity within their business. The study found firms between $200-$500m the most optimistic about AI, while the UK and USA were the least optimistic countries. As UAE ranks 6th, the research implies that UAE is almost ahead than anticipated.\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Country\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Company Size\n\nGlobal businesses face a narrow window of opportunity: the widespread adoption of AI is expected to profoundly impact growth, productivity and competition with repercussions for the balance of power among nations. The findings of this study serve as a wake-up call for businesses lagging in AI adoption, emphasizing the need for a clear AI strategy to stay competitive in the global market.\n\nCash isn't always king\n\nAn easy assumption to make with AI is that the more financial resources available, the more optimism there would be about what could be done with AI. However, the research reveals that businesses with revenues of over $500 Million ranked only third in terms of optimism due to a clear polarization in strategy, data readiness, and skills. Indeed, the polarization in AI readiness has led to 25% of this group believing AI benefits will materialize within 12 months, while the laggards don't expect to see benefits for at least three years. Large enterprises showed the widest gaps in time to benefits of any of the company size groups surveyed.\n\nIn contrast, the survey revealed mid-sized ($50-$200m) firms being less optimistic about AI purely because they have fewer resources and skills to deploy to the technology today, and therefore are planning over a longer period of time to drive benefits from a maturing technology.\n\nChristian Pedersen, Chief Product Officer, IFS, commented: \"At the surface level, the lack of optimism across some respondents may suggest we are at the edge of a trough of disillusionment, particularly following the all-encompassing hype that AI enjoyed for much of the last 18 months. What we are actually witnessing is enterprises differentiating themselves with AI. Organizations that have established a strong data foundation, invested in skills, and embedded sustainability into their strategy are optimistic because they can see the benefits coming into view quickly. It is vital that leaders see AI as a strategy, not a tool.\"\n\nFactors paving the way on the smooth path to AI\n\nDelving into what fuels optimism around AI, the research suggests that companies' architectural readiness directly correlates with their overall optimism about the technology. Respondents who report being more architecturally ready are more likely to be optimistic about AI. This indicates that companies with a strong cloud-based foundation are further along in their AI journeys and are most likely to believe that the tangible benefits of AI will become a reality sooner.\n\nPedersen continued, \"Our research provides direct evidence that the market is dividing into those who have embraced AI and those who have not.\" Pederson emphasized that the projected rewards of AI, potentially unlocking $4.4 trillion in annual corporate profits, are pressuring businesses to adapt. However, without a clear strategy, AI initiatives risk stalling.\n\nEmergence of Industrial AI for productivity, innovation and sustainability\n\nInnovative products and services (31%) and data accessibility (30%) are the most common areas senior decision-makers expect AI to make large differences, followed closely by cost reductions (29%). Interestingly, at a country level, the USA (32%) and Germany (31%) were the only nations most likely to believe that AI will lead to consistent business growth.\n\nThe survey reveals a positive correlation between skills and AI optimism. The nations most likely to identify as having invested heavily in skills for several years are generally more optimistic about AI overall. France (49%), UAE (53%), Norway (48%), Australia (46%), Sweden (46%) and Japan (45%) are leading the way here.\n\nSustainability planning also correlates directly with overall AI optimism. The less wide-ranging a country's sustainability strategy was with regard to AI, the less likely they were to be optimistic about AI in general. UK (5%), Canadian (6%), Danish (6%) and Finnish (4%) respondents were least likely to have an AI strategy for sustainability in place and all feature in the bottom half of the optimism league table.\n\n\"The lofty expectations for AI bely a fundamental misunderstanding of how it is supposed to drive value. The real power lies in Industrial AI, where data flows through every part of your business, combining structured, interlinked datasets to uncover insights, optimize every process and marry the digital with the physical world. That's where the true value lies.

And I mean that globally, not just in the EU. This legislation is not just a set of rules; it reflects a growing recognition of the need to align technological advancement with human rights. For companies in this space, particularly those aiming for leadership like OpenAI, Databricks, Anthropic, and so many more multimillion-dollar firms, the Act offers both a challenge and an opportunity.\n\nNow, the EU AI Act is not on its own. It is just one significant development in the growing framework surrounding artificial intelligence regulation. Alongside this landmark legislation, international organisations like UNESCO and the OECD are actively shaping the conversation about ethical AI practices. UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted by all member states, sets forth global standards that emphasise human rights, transparency, and accountability in AI development. This recommendation serves as a guiding principle for countries looking to implement ethical AI policies. Similarly, the OECD's Principles on Artificial Intelligence promote the idea of trustworthy AI that respects human rights and democratic values. These principles encourage member countries to foster a culture of responsible AI development, ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of ethical considerations. Together, these initiatives create a comprehensive framework that complements the EU AI Act, urging companies and governments alike to prioritise ethical practices as they navigate the complexities of AI technology. As the landscape of AI regulation continues to evolve, these frameworks will be crucial in guiding the responsible development and deployment of AI systems worldwide.\n\nThe EU is certainly leading the way on legislating for AI. But several countries are actively working on their own AI regulations, reflecting a global trend toward establishing frameworks for responsible AI development. Brazil is in the process of drafting its first comprehensive AI law, specifically Bill \u21162338/2023, which aims to create a rights-based and risk-based regulatory framework, like the EU's approach. Japan is considering more structured guidelines for AI as part of its \"Society 5.0\" initiative, although it has not yet established a separate comprehensive AI law, opting instead to integrate AI governance within existing legal frameworks. India is advancing its AI governance through the upcoming Digital India Act, which is expected to address various aspects of digital technology, including high-risk AI applications, and has discussed the establishment of a specialised task force to explore the ethical and legal dimensions of AI. In China, the government is actively drafting a comprehensive AI framework that includes provisions for algorithmic management and ethical governance. Meanwhile, Canada is expected to introduce the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA), which will provide a regulatory framework for AI, and Australia is emphasising voluntary ethical principles while considering future reforms to its regulatory landscape. These developments indicate a growing recognition of the need for structured AI governance across various jurisdictions, each adapting its approach to balance innovation with necessary regulatory oversight.\n\nGoing beyond law, an important supporting trend is the growing framework around AI regulation is fostering increased engagement between AI firms and diverse stakeholders. UNESCO, through initiatives like the Women4Ethical AI platform and the Business Council for Ethics of AI, is bringing together experts from academia, civil society, the private sector, and regulatory bodies to promote ethical AI practices. These collaborative efforts aim to ensure that women are equally represented in the design and deployment of AI systems while also advancing the ethical provisions outlined in UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, UNESCO is working with companies in Latin America to establish the Business Council for Ethics of AI, which serves as a platform for exchanging experiences and promoting ethical standards within the industry.\n\nViewing Compliance as a Moral Responsibility\n\nThe AI Act categorises AI systems by risk, establishing clear expectations for accountability. Compliance should not be seen just as a legal requirement, with boxes to be ticked, but as a fundamental and moral responsibility. Companies have the chance -- and now also the legal imperative -- to set a standard for ethical practice in technology. The industry is new; it should be able to stand up in ushering in a new wave of morality in technology, too. By prioritising human rights in their operations, thoughtful AI firms can demonstrate that innovation and responsibility can go hand in hand. Arguably, no technology should be developing in a moral vacuum, one of the numerous reasons I have always said coders need to take philosophy and ethics classes, too. This sentiment aligns with Kantian ethics, which emphasises the importance of moral duty and treating individuals as ends in themselves, not merely means.\n\nBy embracing compliance as a moral imperative, AI firms uphold the dignity of all stakeholders and contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable digital landscape. This proactive stance can serve as a competitive advantage, attracting consumers and investors who value integrity and social responsibility. In an era of heightened scrutiny and scepticism toward technology, companies that prioritise ethical practices can build trust and loyalty, positioning themselves as leaders in the field. Ultimately, by viewing compliance as an opportunity to shape the future of AI in a way that aligns with universal moral principles, firms can drive innovation while ensuring that the benefits of technological progress are distributed equitably and sustainably.\n\nTackling Algorithmic Bias\n\nIt comes through clearly in the Act just how much of a concern is algorithmic bias, and a concern because of the real consequences for individuals and communities. The AI Act emphasises the need for transparency and accountability, urging companies to confront this issue head-on. This involves critically examining data sources and algorithms to ensure fairness. By investing in diverse data and inclusive practices, AI firms can work toward minimising bias, thereby reinforcing their commitment to human rights. Adopting a proactive stance on bias not only helps in creating more equitable AI systems but also enhances the credibility of the organisation.\n\nAt its simplest, engaging with stakeholders including marginalised groups, let's just call it stakeholder consultation, can provide valuable insights into potential biases and their impacts. This collaborative approach fosters a culture of inclusivity and ensures that the voices of those most affected by AI technologies are heard. By prioritising these efforts, companies can build trust with users, demonstrating that they are not merely adhering to regulatory requirements but are genuinely committed to ethical practices that promote fairness and justice in AI applications. This commitment can ultimately lead to more innovative solutions that benefit a broader range of people, paving the way for a more just and equitable digital future.\n\nThe Importance of Human Oversight\n\nThe AI Act highlights the necessity of human oversight in high-risk applications. This requirement reflects a fundamental truth about the relationship between people and technology. AI should enhance human decision-making rather than replace it. By incorporating mechanisms for human intervention, companies can ensure that technology serves the interests of individuals. This not only protects rights but also builds trust in AI systems. Furthermore, human oversight allows for the critical evaluation of AI outputs, helping to identify and correct potential errors or biases that automated systems might overlook. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of accountability, as humans remain ultimately responsible for the decisions made by AI. It also encourages the development of systems that are more transparent and understandable, enabling users to grasp how decisions are reached. By prioritising human oversight, AI companies can create a safety net that mitigates risks associated with AI, ensuring that technology complements human judgment rather than undermining it. This commitment to oversight not only aligns with regulatory expectations but also positions firms as responsible leaders in the AI space, reinforcing their dedication to ethical standards and the well-being of society.\n\nTransparency as a Key Principle\n\nTransparency is a key aspect of the AI Act, requiring companies to disclose information about their systems and decision-making processes. This obligation encourages AI firms to build trust with consumers and stakeholders. In a climate of scepticism toward technology, being open about methodologies and intentions can help foster confidence. Companies that prioritise transparency signal their commitment to ethical practices, appealing to consumers who value integrity. By embracing transparency, firms can also open new avenues for collaboration and innovation. Sharing knowledge and best practices with the broader AI community can accelerate progress and drive the development of more robust and reliable systems. This collaborative approach fosters a culture of accountability, where companies are willing to subject their work to external scrutiny and feedback. Transparency enables users to make informed decisions about the AI systems they interact with, empowering them to exercise their rights and hold companies accountable. As the AI world evolves, transparency will become increasingly crucial in maintaining public trust and ensuring that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably.\n\nInnovation within Ethical Boundaries\n\nWhile the AI Act imposes certain constraints, it also positively encourages innovation. The establishment of regulatory sandboxes allows companies to test new technologies in a controlled environment. For those not familiar, it is as it sounds: a regulatory sandbox is a framework that allows companies to test innovative products or services in a controlled environment, with regulators providing guidance and oversight to ensure consumer protection while still enabling experimentation and development of new ideas. A sandbox. This presents an opportunity to balance creativity with ethical considerations. By engaging with this framework, AI firms can develop solutions that advance technology while respecting human rights. These sandboxes provide a unique platform for experimentation, enabling companies to explore new ideas without the immediate pressure of full regulatory compliance. This flexibility encourages a culture of responsible innovation, where firms can iterate on their products and services while actively considering their societal impact. These controlled environments facilitate collaboration between regulators, industry experts, and civil society. By working together, stakeholders can identify potential risks and ethical dilemmas early in the development process, allowing for proactive adjustments that align with human rights principles. This collaborative approach not only enhances the quality of the technology being developed but also fosters a sense of shared responsibility among all parties involved. As AI firms navigate the complexities of innovation within these ethical boundaries, they can also leverage insights gained from sandbox testing to inform their broader strategies. This iterative feedback loop can lead to more robust, user-centred designs that prioritise safety, fairness, and transparency.\n\nRecognising Global Implications\n\nAlthough the AI Act is a European initiative, its implications are global. Companies outside the EU must comply if their AI systems affect EU citizens, regardless of where the provider is established or located. This extraterritorial scope means the AI Act will have a significant impact on AI firms no matter where their mailbox is. This reality compels AI companies to recognise their role in a broader context and the importance of responsible innovation on a global scale. By proactively aligning with the AI Act, firms can position themselves as ethical leaders in the international market, demonstrating a commitment to human rights that transcends borders. Aligning with the EU's Act is really about getting ahead of where everywhere else is going anyway. Compliance should be viewed not merely as a legal obligation, but as a strategic imperative to ensure AI development respects fundamental freedoms and promotes societal wellbeing worldwide. This proactive stance can enhance trust with global stakeholders and inspire other nations to adopt similar standards, creating a ripple effect that elevates ethical practices in the AI industry globally\n\nGetting out in Front\n\nAs the EU AI Act sets the stage for a new era in AI governance, AI firms need to clearly be proactive in aligning their operations with human rights principles. AI law, it could be said using that old cinema refrain, is \"coming soon to a cinema near you\". The time to act is now. By prioritising human rights in their development processes, \"Big AI\" can not only ensure compliance with regulatory expectations but also position themselves as leaders in ethical AI. This alignment is not just about avoiding potential pitfalls; it is an opportunity to build trust with users and stakeholders who increasingly demand accountability and transparency. Firms that get ahead of this curve will not only mitigate risks but also enhance their reputations, attract investment, and foster innovation that respects human dignity. Embracing human rights early is now a competitive advantage. Rising to this responsibility will set the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success in a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nA Call for Thoughtful Action\n\nThe all-new AI Act serves as a reminder for the AI industry to integrate human rights into its core operations. By embracing compliance as a responsibility, addressing algorithmic bias, ensuring human oversight, and committing to transparency, companies can ensure technological advancement with integrity. As AI continues to shape the future, it is essential to remember that, perhaps more so now than in the past, technology reflects our values. The decisions made today will have lasting effects. AI firms can lead with purpose, ensuring that the promise of artificial intelligence aligns with the fundamental rights and dignity of all individuals. But the time for thoughtful action is today not tomorrow.", "source": {"uri": "brianiselin67.medium.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medium"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This Act aims to strike a balance between reducing AI-related risks and promoting the use of AI, whilst ensuring the EU remains a global leader in AI innovation and investment. Businesses have 3 years to fully comply with the legislation, with all key obligations to be in place within the next 24 months.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThe Act focuses heavily on protecting people's health, safety and rights from the risks associated with AI. It categorises AI based on risk, breaking this down into four risk categories. This risk-based approach represents a key objective of the EU to remain competitive and have proportionate regulation of AI. It is designed to ensure that AI is applied safely and that the obligations that are required under the legislation does not act as a deterrent against the safe application of AI.\n\nWho is affected?\n\nThe Act applies to creators, distributers and users of AI systems who deploy AI in a professional capacity in the EU, as well as to third-country providers of AI (if their AI outputs affect the EU).\n\nAI categorised under the Unacceptable-Risk category are prohibited. The category includes systems that could pose a threat to the safety, livelihoods or fundamental rights of citizens. Examples given in the Act include:\n\nHigh Risk\n\nThe majority of the Act focuses on high-risk AI systems, which face strict regulations. These include AI used in:\n\nLimited Risk\n\nThis category is smaller in comparison to the other three and obligations are lesser, focusing on transparency. It provides that developers and providers must ensure that end-users are aware that they are interacting with AI. For example, users should be knowledgeable that they are interacting with AI when engaging with a chatbot or deep-fake.\n\nMinimal Risk\n\nSystems which do not fall under any of the other three categories are unregulated. This category includes the majority of AI applications currently available on the EU single market, such as AI-enabled video games and spam filters.\n\nObligations of High Risk AI providers\n\nHigh-Risk AI is subject to strict regulations before it may be put on the market including the following:\n\nEnforcement and Penalties\n\nThe European AI Office was established by the European Commission to the AI Act's enforcement at EU level. At a national level, EU Member States must establish their own national competent authorities to enforce the rules in their countries before next August. Companies found not to be in compliance with the Act could face fines potentially amounting up to \u20ac35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis legislation will be welcomed by a wide variety of businesses seeking to make use of the benefits that come with AI. The balance struck in the Act between risk mitigation and promotion of the use of AI systems is designed to ensure legal certainty for developers and users while also encouraging market uptake of AI.

And that's reflected in a new research report which showed embracing a people-centric approach while adopting generative AI (GenAI) could add an extra $675 billion for India in economic value by 2038.\n\nThe report published by consulting major Accenture showed that in India, 31 per cent of working hours will either be automated or augmented by generative AI. It could lead to a 0.6 percentage point increase in GDP growth per year and an additional $675 billion in economic value by the given time frame.\n\nThe report combined economic modelling conducted for four of Asia Pacific's largest economies, including Australia, China, India and Japan, and a CXO survey in these countries and Singapore and found that responsible GenAI adoption could add an extra 4.5 trillion in economic value in APAC over the next 15 years.\n\n\"The scaled and responsible deployment of generative AI can not only drive revenue growth but also act as a force of change that can reinvent almost all functions across industries,\" said Saurabh Kumar Sahu, Lead for India Business at Accenture.\n\nTo unlock its real value, businesses need to have a bold vision for reinvention anchored in a strong data and technology foundation. \"This coupled with an intentional approach to skilling is crucial to succeed in the age of generative AI,\" Sahu added.\n\nThis phenomenon of AI becoming pervasive across the core sectors of the Indian economy is also leading to enhanced perceived risks. Rishi Aurora, Managing Partner at IBM Consulting India & South Asia, said in an article shared with TechCircle, that the ethical implications of AI implementation are no longer peripheral concerns but central considerations for corporate governance. Concerns such as regulations, ethics, data governance, trust, and legality are gaining rapid significance - warranting the board of directors to add it to their agenda.\n\n\"Boards must proactively establish clear guidelines and standards, and integrate ethical considerations into strategic decision-making processes. Moreover, fostering a culture of ethical awareness and accountability throughout the organization is essential for ensuring that responsible AI principles are upheld at every level,\" he said.\n\nMuthumari S, Senior Director and Global Head of AI Studio at AI services Brillio, emphasises that strong AI literacy that encompasses training and enablement programmes often leads to greater responsible AI.\n\nLikewise, the Accenture survey shows about 96 per cent of APAC business leaders acknowledge the significant impact of generative AI, and 91 per cent of APAC workers indicate that they are keen to acquire new skills to work with generative AI, but only 4 per cent of business leaders have rolled out generative AI training at scale.\n\nThe most impacted industries include Capital markets where generative AI will transform nearly three-quarters of working hours (71 per cent) and software and platforms where two-thirds (66 per cent) of working hours will be automated or augmented. This is followed by banking (64 per cent), insurance (62 per cent) and retail (49 per cent), said the report.\n\nA Bosch survey published in March found that nearly 60 per cent of Indians believe responsible AI use can improve work processes. Additionally, a Salesforce report revealed that 67% of senior IT leaders plan to focus on generative AI in the next two years, but they stress the need for a secure framework due to concerns about security risks and potential biases. Organizations must prioritize ethical and responsible AI deployment. That said, without clear ethical standards, generative AI could lead to unintended harm.", "source": {"uri": "techcircle.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techcircle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sohini_bagchi@techcircle.in", "name": "Sohini Bagchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://assets.techcircle.in/uploads/article-image/2024/08/images/35163-generative-ai.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Hosted by the Digital Data Design (D^3) Institute at Harvard and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard, the event is a hub of cutting-edge ideas and forward-thinking strategies. It is an exciting time to be immersed in such an environment, especially as we navigate a world that demands constant learning and preparation for the future.\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving landscape, the ability to adapt and integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into our personal and professional lives is not just beneficial -- it's essential. As we stand on the brink of significant change, staying ahead means embracing innovation, and that begins with individual readiness for AI.\n\nAI Readiness: Why It Matters\n\nAs we progress into a future where AI plays an increasingly integral role, the ability to understand and utilize AI effectively becomes a competitive advantage. Currently, 50% of companies are using AI in at least one business function, and the adoption is rapidly increasing. According to a recent McKinsey report, businesses that leverage AI technologies are seeing an increase in productivity by 40%. Moreover, the AI market is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, underlining the transformative potential of AI.\n\nThe shift towards a skills-based approach, with AI at its core, aligns with the evolving nature of work. Traditional job roles are giving way to dynamic skillsets, where AI serves as both a tool and a partner. This transformation demands that individuals and organizations pivot from static career paths to a fluid skills-based framework, enabling them to adapt swiftly to changing circumstances.\n\nPersonal Growth and Organizational Success\n\nFor individuals, AI readiness is a pathway to personal growth and career advancement. It opens doors to new opportunities and equips professionals with the skills needed to thrive in a technology-driven world. For organizations, fostering AI readiness among employees translates into enhanced productivity, innovation, and a competitive edge.\n\nCompanies that invest in AI readiness are more likely to attract and retain top talent. They are also better equipped to leverage AI for strategic decision-making, operational efficiency, and customer engagement. According to a Gartner report, by 2025, 75% of enterprises will shift from piloting AI to operationalizing it, driving a fivefold increase in streaming data and analytics infrastructures. As AI continues to reshape industries, the ability to harness its potential becomes a defining factor for success.\n\nThe AI-Maturity Index: Pioneering Readiness\n\nIn this spirit, I am thrilled to introduce a new initiative: the AI-Maturity Index.

But those seats might be more like folding chairs -- temporary.\n\nA recent Gartner poll of more than 1,800 executive leaders showed that over half (55%) of organizations now have an AI board, and 54% of organizations have a head of AI or an AI leader.\n\nThe companies that need AI boards are the ones that struggle with new technology implementation the most, Garter Distinguished Analyst Frances Karamouzis told Fierce Network.\n\nWhether they're large hub-and-spoke organizations, or those that have never had such a concentration of spending or requests, these companies want to put in an AI board or an AI leader as \"an interim sort of stopgap.\"\n\n\"It's a measure to make sure that they're not treading in place,\" Karamouzis added.\n\nSome organizations are even creating a \"Chief AI Officer\" role to address these concerns. However, of the 54% of executive leaders who indicated their organization had a head of AI, or an AI leader, 88% said that their AI leader did not have the title of CAIO.\n\nThat's likely because most boards do not want to expand the C-suite, the Gartner report said, despite wanting a leader who is responsible for AI orchestration. And according to Karamouzis, it's not totally necessary for them to have a title at the C-suite level. For many organizations the firm polled, accountability for AI is spread out.\n\nStates are also getting in on the action, orchestrating their own AI task forces. Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, for example, recently announced the formation of an 18-member AI task force dedicated to \"exploring AI's implications and developing legislative measures to mitigate potential biases and workforce disruptions.\"\n\nAnd legislatures in states including Colorado, Illinois, Texas, Vermont and Virginia have created task forces or commissions to study AI. Several governors have also created AI task forces by executive order.\n\nAppointing these boards and leaders isn't \"necessarily a bad idea,\" Karamouzis said.\n\n\"We just don't think that it's going to be something that's long term,\" she continued. \"In other words, five years from now, we don't really think there's going to be AI boards as a mainstay.\"\n\nGartner argued that while they are here, AI boards should have clearly defined rules that map back to business remits.\n\nAI board members should represent multiple disciplines and business units, ensuring speed and agility without making the board unwieldy, Karamouzis said in the poll report. She also highlighted the importance of having senior, experienced board members with strong strategic and execution skills.\n\nDespite the trend, many companies (47%) polled by Gartner are choosing not to create separate AI boards. That could mean they already have effective processes for managing technology requests, Karamouzis noted. Many of these organizations view AI as \"just another technology,\" albeit one with unique power and risks, and prefer to integrate it into their existing governance structures rather than establishing separate processes.\n\n\"Those companies who are in that 47% are likely on the side of doing more successful AI initiatives,\" Karamouzis concluded.", "source": {"uri": "fierce-network.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fierce Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Washington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ferguson_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlene's Flowers lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/conference%20room.jpg?VersionId=eg7rKsQjX2J7XDobD7m8fyrdaTPAK78O", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Over 300 full-time decision-makers in data management or AI roles at their companies participated in the survey. All the respondents were director-level or higher.\n\nRising concerns about AI ethics, security risks, and data privacy have driven U.S. business leaders to call for robust AI regulations and governance. According to Collibra, the respondents are in support of both, federal (76%) and state (75%), regulations to oversee the technology's development.\n\nThe respondents prefer federal and state regulations over international oversight. In the absence of federal guidelines, several states in the US have already begun implementing their own AI regulations.\n\nMost recently, Colorado became the first state to enact comprehensive AI legislation that introduces specific requirements for developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems. Utah and Tennessee have also enacted laws that provide guidelines for AI transparency and accountability.\n\n\"Without regulations, the U.S. will lose the AI race long term,\" said Collibra co-founder and CEO Felix Van de Maele. \"While AI innovation continues to advance rapidly, the lack of a regulatory framework puts content owners at risk, and ultimately will hinder the adoption of AI.\"\n\nThe European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act went into effect on August 1 with the aim to unify existing regulations across EU member states while also establishing new legal frameworks for the use of AI.\n\nThe impact of the EU AI Act extends far beyond the borders of Europe. The global AI industry is led by American companies and they will have to be cautious in how they collect data to avoid unintentionally gathering European citizens' data for training purposes. Meta has also cited Europe's regulatory environment as too \"unpredictable\", and decided it will not release its multimodal Llama AI model in the EU.\n\nThe Collibra report highlights that larger firms, with 1000+ employees, are more likely to back federal and state AI regulations compared to smaller companies with less than 100 employees.\n\nSmaller companies are often more skeptical and cautious in how they approach new technologies. With their relatively limited resources and experience in AI, they tend to view the new technology as costly and disruptive. In addition, they may view AI regulations as being tailored for big tech players in the industry, making them less supportive of such regulations.\n\nThe report shows that security risks and privacy concerns topped the list of perceived threats to AI regulations in the U.S. Companies like Collibra can play a key role in addressing these issues by providing robust AI governance solutions that can mitigate these challenges effectively.\n\nThe call for updated copyright laws comes at a time when several high-profile lawsuits have been filed against AI companies for alleged copyright infringement. The Collibra survey revealed that 81% of respondents believe that Big Tech companies should compensate people whose data is used to train AI models.\n\nAs AI technologies advance at a rapid pace, 75% of respondents say their organizations are privatizing AI training and upskilling. Nearly 9 in 10 decision makers are more confident about their company's AI direction but have significantly lower trust in the government.\n\nAccording to Van de Maele, AI is moving so fast that companies need to look three to five years ahead in the future. He recommends that companies focus on turning data into their biggest currency and not view data as a constraint. Van De Maele also recommends creating a trusted and tested AI framework and prioritizing responsible access before responsible AI.\n\nRelated Items\n\nAI Regs a Moving Target in the US, But Keep an Eye on Europe", "source": {"uri": "datanami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Datanami"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_azhar@datanami.com", "name": "Ali Azhar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AI_regs_shutterstock_Dmitry-Demidovich.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1655, "textEnd": 1663}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

According to the ISG Pulse Check State of the European Insurance Industry 2024, insurance firms are actively engaged in generative AI transformations and currently comprise nearly a quarter of all generative AI use across various industries.\n\nThis transformative technology is helping insurers unlock value and innovation, gain deeper insights into their clientele, enhance the precision of risk assessments, and elevate the quality of offerings. Insurance firms in the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) see their top priority for generative AI as customer service delivery and claims management, followed by customer personalization, employee productivity, insurance operations delivery, policy administration and upselling/cross-selling.\n\nWhile the potential of generative AI has positioned it as a key investment priority for insurance firms, ISG research finds the prevalent trend in the insurance industry right now is experimentation and enthusiasm, despite still-elusive outcomes. Five percent of EMEA insurance firms currently have no investment in GenAI, while 32 percent are pursuing exploratory initiatives, 36 percent are running isolated projects, 25 percent have transformation work in progress, and only 2 percent are moving to steady state.\n\nFor insurance firms that are yet to explore this technological frontier, a window of opportunity exists to bridge the gap and stay abreast of competitors before the landscape evolves further.\n\nHow Generative AI Will Impact Insurance Firms\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to transform every facet of the insurance value chain, from initial customer interaction to claims resolution and beyond. For example, unlike conventional claims processing methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention and predefined rules, GenAI leverages advanced algorithms to generate insights autonomously. This enables organizations to expedite the claims processing cycle, optimize resource allocation and mitigate operational risks.\n\nAccording to ISG analysis, European insurance firms are poised to experience significant operational efficiency and service quality enhancements, with potential improvements in claims handling efficiency and quality ranging between 40 and 60 percent. This is coupled with a notable 30 to 40 percent boost in customer satisfaction and cost reductions of up to 50 percent thanks to generative AI technologies.\n\nInsurance firms can only fully realize these benefits if they adopt and seamlessly integrate generative AI throughout their value chain. By leveraging this innovative technology, insurers can unlock new avenues for growth, streamline processes, and ultimately, deliver unparalleled value to their stakeholders.\n\nHow Insurance Firms Should Implement Generative AI\n\nToday, enterprises are starting with specific generative AI use cases to test and demonstrate tangible value and win buy-in from internal stakeholders. These test cases often focus on enhancing day-to-day operations, leveraging AI for tasks like coding assistance or deploying chatbots as knowledgeable assistants. Next, insurers are shifting to comprehensive transformation initiatives aimed at reshaping end-to-end processes like automated claims processing or personalized marketing strategies to enhance efficiency and customer experience.\n\nHowever, a more comprehensive strategy that considers the broader organizational landscape and aligns generative AI initiatives with the overarching business objectives, AI strategy, operating model, ecosystem and sourcing model would boost an organization's chances of realizing substantial and sustained value from generative AI implementations.\n\nTo create a robust framework that elevates generative AI from a tool into a strategic enabler that revolutionizes business operations and drives sustainable growth, insurers should build:\n\n* A strategy that starts with the C-suite's vision and acts as the spearhead for all other discussions. The success of any generative AI integration requires senior leadership guidance and buy-in.\n\n* The cognitive infrastructure that forms the base technology foundation on which everything else is built. This is a conceptual infrastructure, filled with hybrid cloud technology platforms, security policies, edge computing, and any other purpose-built assets that serve and enable generative AI.\n\n* The AI control pane, with measures and mechanisms to ensure ethical, secure, compliant, reliable implementation and operation of generative AI, and a method for tracking its impact.\n\n* The data layers of all the structured and unstructured data owned by the organization, mechanisms to transform the data and generative AI models.\n\n* The operational functions that serve the functional activities, such as intelligent AI chatbots for customer service. This is where the vision and value of generative AI is executed and realized.\n\nStrategically adopting generative AI requires a meticulous approach. This framework fosters cohesion among diverse business functions, enhances operational efficiency, and acts as an instrument for pre-emptively resolving and troubleshooting issues. It also serves as a compass for identifying capability gaps and facilitating targeted interventions to bridge these gaps effectively.", "source": {"uri": "insurancejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Insurance Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-selling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-selling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Service quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resource allocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personalized marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edge computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2024/08/discernment-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

While AI promises to revolutionize various sectors, from healthcare to finance, the erosion of public trust in AI safety is becoming a critical concern.\n\nThis growing skepticism is fueled by factors such as a lack of transparency, ethical considerations, and high-profile failures. Addressing these issues cannot be overstated, as public trust is essential for the widespread acceptance and successful integration of AI technologies.\n\nIt's essential to understand the key factors contributing to the decline in public trust regarding AI safety and explore the critical role of transparency and ethical considerations. Additionally, it's crucial to understand the implications of public distrust for the future of AI across various sectors, including workplaces.\n\nBy discussing these concerns head-on, we can pave the way for a future in which AI serves as a reliable and trusted force for good.\n\nKey factors contributing to the decline in public trust regarding AI safety\n\nThe erosion of public trust in AI safety is driven by several key factors. Foremost among these is the lack of transparency, as many AI systems operate as 'black boxes' with opaque decision-making processes that leave the public wary and skeptical.\n\nEthical concerns also play a significant role. Issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and unethical applications of AI exacerbate fears about the technology's fairness and integrity.\n\nHigh-profile failures and incidents further amplify these concerns. Accidents involving autonomous vehicles, discriminatory recruitment algorithms, and errors in AI-driven medical diagnoses highlight AI's potential dangers and limitations. Such incidents receive widespread media attention, often sensationalized, which magnifies public apprehension.\n\nThe media's influence on the rapid adoption of AI can also not be overlooked. Sensationalized coverage of AI mishaps contributes to a negative public perception, painting AI as inherently risky and untrustworthy.\n\nThe combination of these factors creates a challenging environment for AI developers who must work diligently to address these issues and rebuild public confidence. Without addressing these fundamental concerns, the promise of AI's benefits will remain overshadowed by public distrust and apprehension.\n\nThe critical role of transparency and ethical considerations in AI development\n\nTransparency and ethical considerations are paramount in fostering public trust in AI safety. Ensuring these aspects can significantly mitigate concerns and build confidence among users and stakeholders.\n\nTransparency involves clear communication about how AI systems operate, their limitations, and the measures taken to ensure their safety and fairness. Developers should openly share information about data sources, algorithmic processes, and decision-making criteria to help demystify AI technologies and demonstrate a commitment to accountability.\n\nEthical considerations in AI development are equally important. Integrating ethical principles, such as fairness, accountability, and non-discrimination, into the design and deployment of AI systems is crucial. Developers must actively work to eliminate biases in algorithms and ensure that AI applications do not reinforce existing societal inequalities. Independent audits and certifications can further enhance public trust by validating AI systems' safety and ethical standards, while regular reviews by third-party organizations provide an external check, assuring the public that rigorous standards are being met.\n\nPractical strategies for AI companies to rebuild trust and ensure safety\n\nAI companies can adopt several practical strategies to rebuild public trust and ensure the safety of their technologies. Robust regulatory compliance is foundational in adhering to and exceeding established standards for AI safety and ethics, as this commitment demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing potential risks and aligning with best practices.\n\nInclusive stakeholder engagement is another critical strategy. By involving a diverse range of stakeholders -- ethicists, technologists, policymakers, and the public -- AI companies can gather comprehensive input and address various concerns. This collaborative approach ensures that diverse perspectives are considered, fostering greater public confidence.\n\nPublishing transparency reports is also vital. Regular reports detailing the AI development process, safety measures, and ethical considerations provide clear, accessible information to the public. These reports should highlight the steps to mitigate risks, protect user data, and ensure fairness.\n\nAdditionally, implementing independent audits and certifications can enhance credibility. Regular reviews by third-party organizations verify that AI systems meet rigorous safety and ethical standards, providing external validation.\n\nThe broader implications of public distrust for the future of AI in various sectors\n\nPublic distrust in AI has far-reaching implications across various sectors, potentially stalling the technology's transformative potential. In the workplace, skepticism towards AI-driven automation can slow its integration, affecting productivity and innovation. Employees may resist AI tools, fearing job displacement or unfair performance evaluations, which hinders the collaborative potential between humans and machines.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, distrust can significantly impact the adoption of AI in diagnostics and treatment planning. Patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to rely on AI systems, fearing inaccuracies or biases in medical decision-making. This reluctance can stifle advancements in AI-driven medical technologies that have the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare delivery.\n\nThe financial industry also faces challenges. Concerns about algorithmic bias and data security can affect the acceptance of AI in areas such as credit scoring, fraud detection, and personalized financial services. Public distrust can lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and slower adoption of AI innovations.\n\nMoreover, in public services and government, AI implementation could be hindered by fears of surveillance and privacy violations. This could limit the use of AI in areas like law enforcement and social services.\n\nThe broader implications of public distrust, from slowing workplace automation to hindering healthcare advancements, highlight the urgency of this issue. Addressing these concerns is not merely about mitigating risks but also about unlocking the full potential of AI to transform industries and improve lives. As we navigate the complexities of AI adoption, fostering a culture of trust and responsibility will be pivotal. By strategically addressing these challenges and ensuring a harmonious collaboration between humans and intelligent machines, we can pave the way for a future where AI serves as a reliable and trusted force for good, driving innovation and prosperity.\n\nImage credit: BiancoBlue/depositphotos.com", "source": {"uri": "betanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BetaNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artificial-intelligence-safety-security.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

In a recent article, I covered the vital need for every business, no matter what industry it's in, to have an AI policy in place.\n\nA comprehensive guide on how AI should be used -- or not used -- is critical for organizations that want to avoid risks such as breaching privacy, exposing sensitive data, infringing copyright, and ultimately destroying customer trust.\n\nOr, to put a more positive spin on it, clearly setting out guidelines for acceptable AI use would position a company to capitalize on what is set to be the most transformative business opportunity of our lifetimes.\n\nThe next question is how to create this policy. Here, I'll provide a step-by-step guide to ensure all the bases are covered.\n\nFirstly, who is going to create your policy? To me, it makes sense to involve everyone who will be affected by AI. This will establish buy-in across the organization and avoid \"top-down\" policy implementation that can leave those who are most affected feeling alienated. Form a working group consisting of representatives of every group whose views need to be included, including executives, technical experts, legal experts, minority groups and front-line staff.\n\nClearly set out the intention behind the creation of the AI policy. Communicate the risks of unregulated AI use and the benefits of building a culture around responsible, ethical and accountable use of AI. This is about education and is where awareness can be raised of dangers such as bias, discrimination, breach of privacy, and exposure of confidential information.\n\nWho will be responsible for ensuring that AI is used in a way that's safe, ethical and fair? Ensure everyone using AI understands that they're responsible for its outcomes, and particularly, they have an important part to play in mitigating its risks. Ensure a reporting process is in place for anyone concerned about any aspect of AI use and that everyone knows how to access it.\n\nThis involves compiling a list of all the current use cases for AI within your organization, big or small - from employees using ChatGPT to draft emails to more sophisticated operational use cases such as predictive analytics or personalized marketing initiatives. Make sure you're aware of every use that's being found for AI, who is using it, what data and tools are involved and what it hopes to accomplish. It's a good idea to assign a risk level to each use case based on how likely it is to cause harm due to the risks we've identified. This will be useful when it comes to defining rules and guidelines, as described below.\n\nNext, conduct a thorough assessment of the laws and regulations that you're obliged to follow. This will vary depending on your jurisdiction, the industries you're involved in, and the tools, use cases and data you're using. This knowledge will be critical when it comes to creating your own internal rules and guidelines around AI use.\n\nEstablish a process for adopting and implementing new AI tools, processes and use cases. Who is responsible for vetting and ensuring they are compliant with your policy, and what safeguards should be in place before they are rolled out into operation?\n\nNow, it's time to set out some specific rules. Identify individual tools or data that are acceptable or unacceptable based on business requirements, the need to facilitate innovation and regulatory obligations. If, for example, it's decided that employees should be free to use tools like ChatGPT for low-risk activities like drafting emails but shouldn't use it for anything involving customer data or confidential business information, this is where this should be stipulated.\n\nThis section will perhaps be the most comprehensive part of the policy and will also be used to set out high-level obligations, such as ensuring customers are always made aware when AI is used to make decisions that affect them or mandating fact-checking and verification of any content created with the help of AI before it is published.\n\nSet out guidelines and best practices to ensure that all employees are both educated about the risks and opportunities of AI and informed about the responsibilities placed on them by the policy.\n\nThis involves drafting the policy in a way that's comprehensive but clear and ensuring that it's accessible to everybody. This could involve creating different versions of a policy document intended for different audiences (new employees, business managers, and contractors, for example). Encourage dialogue around the policy and create channels for receiving feedback and suggestions for improvements. Stipulate how the policy will be distributed, where it can be found, and how stakeholders will be kept up-to-date on any changes or updates.\n\nFinally, you need to know how well your policy is working when it comes to mitigating risks and enabling innovation. Establish some KPIs that could help you track this. Examples might include:\n\nCompliance Rate - The percentage of AI projects that pass an audit based on the rules set out in the policy.\n\nEmployee Awareness - Results of surveys designed to monitor the extent to which employees are aware of organizational AI policies.\n\nIncident Rate - The number of reported incidents of AI-related issues such as data or ethical breaches.\n\nEmployee/Customer Engagement Rates - The number of employees or customers using your organizational AI tools, products or services\n\nExternal Auditing Performance - Scores or ratings of AI safety, ethicality or accountability based on independent third-party assessments of your systems or processes.\n\nWorking through these steps should leave you with a solid foundation on which your organization can build to benefit from AI's exciting opportunities while minimizing the serious risks associated with it.\n\nIt's important, however, to remember that we're in the early days of the AI revolution. Both the technology and the regulation around it are constantly evolving, and new obligations and risks are certain to emerge.\n\nThis means your policy should be constantly evolving, too, with processes in place to ensure it's kept up-to-date and relevant.\n\nI highly recommend doing it now rather than simply adding it to the to-do list or waiting until you feel as if you have more AI to manage. Implementing it in an early stage of your AI journey means that your AI strategy and infrastructure will evolve on a sound footing.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top-down and bottom-up design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personalized marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fact-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Performance indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b5acafa55e4f6d73dbe0be/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Now the UN wants to rein it in", "body": "A UN agency is creating guidelines for use of AI in the legal world.\n\nThe outlook for AI in the courtroom didn't look too promising last year when multiple state prosecutors threatened a startup CEO with jail time if he went through with plans to equip a defendant with an \"AI lawyer\" that would give real-time legal guidance via an earpiece during proceedings. When two New York lawyers were sanctioned for submitting a legal brief that included fictitious case citations generated by ChatGPT, it looked even more bleak. Yet courts, judges, and law firms worldwide have begun adopting generative AI without any real standards or guidelines.\n\nBrazil's government, for example, made headlines earlier this summer for tapping ChatGPT to analyze in-progress cases, flag lawsuits to act on, and surface trends and suggestions for action. In Argentina, judges are using LLMs to generate summaries of their decisions in plain language. India's Supreme Court is using AI to translate legal documents between English and 10 local vernaculars. And as my Eye on AI colleague Jeremy Kahn and I have both been reporting, law firms and corporate legal divisions are embracing a new crop of startups offering AI legal copilots.\n\nWith so much AI sweeping through the legal system, UNESCO is now calling for formal guidelines for the use of AI in courts and tribunals. The organization, a division of the United Nations focused on science, education, and culture, published its final draft of guidelines aimed at helping ensure use of AI technologies by courts and tribunals aligns with the fundamental principles of justice, human rights, and the rule of law. The organization is seeking feedback on the guidelines from legal professionals and the public through Sept. 5 before releasing the final version in November.\n\nWhile AI tools can be helpful in the judicial system, they can also \"undermine human rights, such as fair trial and due process, access to justice and effective remedy, privacy and data protection, equality before the law, and non-discrimination, as well as judicial values such as impartiality, independence, and accountability,\" reads a document introducing the draft guidelines. \"Moreover, the misuse of AI systems may undermine society's trust in the judicial system. AI tools are not a substitute for qualified legal reasoning, human judgment, or tailored legal advice.\"\n\nIn a 2023 survey of judicial operators, UNESCO found that while 44% are already using AI tools such as ChatGPT for work-related activities, only 9% reported that their organization issued guidelines or provided AI-related training. In addition to this disparity, the document cites the adoption of new regulations like the EU AI Act as a major reason why such guidelines are more urgent. The EU AI Act -- which went into full force last week -- classifies AI systems intended to be used by judicial authorities or for interpreting the law as \"high risk\" and thus subject to various requirements around risk management and human oversight.\n\nUNESCO's guidelines are broken down into advice for organizations that are part of the judiciary and for individual members of the judiciary. For the former, recommendations for adopting AI tools include evaluating the necessity and appropriateness of using the technology for specific tasks and assessing the impact of AI systems on human rights and other topics before deploying them. The guidance also states that judiciary bodies should choose AI systems that offer greater transparency into their training data, obtain information from the AI system's developers and providers about its limits and risks, require systems to allow for human intervention and ensure the developer agrees to collaborate with algorithmic audits commissioned by the organization to external parties. UNESCO also calls for more stringent data privacy protections, more robust data governance frameworks, improved cybersecurity, and the continuous publication of impact evaluations and performance reports. Another section recommends guidelines specific to generative AI, including ensuring the authenticity and integrity of content produced by such systems, knowing their limitations, and banning some uses altogether.\n\n\"When the terms of use of a generative AI tool indicate that the user's prompts will be used by the provider to train its models or that third parties can access these prompts, then the use of such tool should be prohibited or restricted,\" the document reads, adding that using AI in certain sensitive areas, such as the unilateral generation of binding legal decisions, should also be banned.\n\nGuidelines for individuals center more around being aware of the uses and limitations of AI tools, avoiding over-reliance on them, and verifying that any outputs from AI systems are accurate. For transparency, it also states individuals should provide meaningful information about when and how they use AI tools, as well as let interested parties or clients challenge decisions taken with or supported by AI systems. The guidelines also specifically call out LLMs as unreliable both as search engines and for legal analysis.\n\nOverall, the UNESCO draft recommendations represent the most comprehensive guidance for AI in the legal system yet. While several U.S. state bars including California, New York, New Jersey, and Florida have issued their own, the finalized UNESCO recommendations can help jurisdictions that are still working on navigating these fast-moving and increasingly thorny issues.\n\nMany legal departments have been quick to embrace the efficiencies that AI could provide for their often tedious work, but it's clear AI in the legal realm comes with various risks as well -- both to individuals navigating the legal system and practitioners and judiciaries themselves. UNESCO is focused on the impact on human rights, but lawyers, judges, and governments should be concerned for themselves too (as those two New York lawyers who trusted ChatGPT to write their brief can attest). The American Bar Association recently warned lawyers to beware of deepfakes, which can be used for everything from fabricating evidence to making ransom demands and could put them at risk of malpractice if they fail to detect them. Even U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts concluded the court's 2023 year-end report with thoughts on AI's role in the legal systems and some words of caution.\n\n\"Any use of AI requires caution and humility,\" he wrote.\n\nCorrection: Last week's edition (Aug. 1) misspelled the name of one of the startups OpenAI acquired in June.

The agreement between the companies will make an array of AI and analytics services available to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies in classified environments. Despite criticism of how AI could be used to accelerate warfare or infringe on civil liberties, the deal further cements the use of AI into defense and surveillance. Palantir has garnered intense scrutiny over the years for its secretive operations, surveillance and predictive policing technology products, and for its long-running contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to track undocumented immigrants.\n\nByteDance-owned Faceu Technology launches a text-to-video generating app. That's according to Reuters. The app, called Jimeng AI, is now available for Chinese users in Apple's App Store. Since OpenAI unveiled its Sora model that can generate videos based on short text prompts in February (which it still has yet to release), Chinese startups have been racing to offer similar technologies. Several have since launched text-to-video models that can create short clips and are easily accessible to users in app form.\n\nMore people are returning Humane's AI Pin than are buying it. That's according to The Verge. The company has hit $1 million in returns of its wearable LLM-in-a-box against only $9 million in sales, not counting 1,000 purchases that were canceled before shipping. Humane disputed the numbers to The Verge but didn't provide any specifics about the supposed inaccuracies. Reviews for the AI Pin have been resoundingly negative, so the high rate of returns is not exactly a shock. The company raised over $200 million from Silicon Valley investors, however, and has seen executive turnover in recent months.\n\nIntel, now struggling against AI competitors, turned down an opportunity to own 15% of OpenAI -- by Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez\n\nSome European users will get access to Apple Intelligence after all -- by David Meyer\n\nAutodesk's 'discovery mentality' gives managers permission to roll out AI experiments -- by John Kell\n\nCan Southeast Asian countries work together to regulate AI?

According to the ISG Pulse Check State of the European Insurance Industry 2024, insurance firms are actively engaged in generative AI transformations and currently comprise nearly a quarter of all generative AI use across various industries.\n\nThis transformative technology is helping insurers unlock value and innovation, gain deeper insights into their clientele, enhance the precision of risk assessments, and elevate the quality of offerings.\n\nInsurance firms in the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) see their top priority for generative AI as customer service delivery and claims management, followed by customer personalization, employee productivity, insurance operations delivery, policy administration and upselling/cross-selling.\n\nWhile the potential of generative AI has positioned it as a key investment priority for insurance firms, ISG research finds the prevalent trend in the insurance industry right now is experimentation and enthusiasm, despite still-elusive outcomes. There are 5% of EMEA insurance firms that currently have no investment in GenAI, while 32% are pursuing exploratory initiatives, 36% are running isolated projects, 25% have transformation work in progress, and only 2% are moving to steady state.\n\nFor insurance firms that are yet to explore this technological frontier, a window of opportunity exists to bridge the gap and stay abreast of competitors before the landscape evolves further.\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to transform every facet of the insurance value chain, from initial customer interaction to claims resolution and beyond. For example, unlike conventional claims processing methods, which rely heavily on manual intervention and predefined rules, GenAI leverages advanced algorithms to generate insights autonomously. This enables organizations to expedite the claims processing cycle, optimize resource allocation and mitigate operational risks.\n\nAccording to ISG analysis, European insurance firms are poised to experience significant operational efficiency and service quality enhancements, with potential improvements in claims handling efficiency and quality ranging between 40% and 60%. This is coupled with a notable 30% to 40% boost in customer satisfaction and cost reductions of up to 50 percent thanks to generative AI technologies.\n\nInsurance firms can only fully realize these benefits if they adopt and seamlessly integrate generative AI throughout their value chain. By leveraging this innovative technology, insurers can unlock new avenues for growth, streamline processes, and ultimately, deliver unparalleled value to their stakeholders.\n\nToday, enterprises are starting with specific generative AI use cases to test and demonstrate tangible value and win buy-in from internal stakeholders. These test cases often focus on enhancing day-to-day operations, leveraging AI for tasks like coding assistance or deploying chatbots as knowledgeable assistants. Next, insurers are shifting to comprehensive transformation initiatives aimed at reshaping end-to-end processes like automated claims processing or personalized marketing strategies to enhance efficiency and customer experience.\n\nHowever, a more comprehensive strategy that considers the broader organizational landscape and aligns generative AI initiatives with the overarching business objectives, AI strategy, operating model, ecosystem and sourcing model would boost an organization's chances of realizing substantial and sustained value from generative AI implementations.\n\nTo create a robust framework that elevates generative AI from a tool into a strategic enabler that revolutionizes business operations and drives sustainable growth, insurers should build:\n\n* A strategy that starts with the C-suite's vision and acts as the spearhead for all other discussions. The success of any generative AI integration requires senior leadership guidance and buy-in.\n\n* The cognitive infrastructure that forms the base technology foundation on which everything else is built. This is a conceptual infrastructure, filled with hybrid cloud technology platforms, security policies, edge computing, and any other purpose-built assets that serve and enable generative AI.\n\n* The AI control pane, with measures and mechanisms to ensure ethical, secure, compliant, reliable implementation and operation of generative AI, and a method for tracking its impact.\n\n* The data layers of all the structured and unstructured data owned by the organization, mechanisms to transform the data and generative AI models.\n\n* The operational functions that serve the functional activities, such as intelligent AI chatbots for customer service. This is where the vision and value of generative AI is executed and realized.\n\nStrategically adopting generative AI requires a meticulous approach. This framework fosters cohesion among diverse business functions, enhances operational efficiency, and acts as an instrument for pre-emptively resolving and troubleshooting issues. It also serves as a compass for identifying capability gaps and facilitating targeted interventions to bridge these gaps effectively.", "source": {"uri": "claimsjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Claims Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-selling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-selling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Service quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resource allocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personalized marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edge computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/img/social/cj-social-post-1104x736.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Now, industries and roles across the board recognize the necessity of integrating this technology into their workflows, leading to a substantial increase in adoption. Just last year, the global market for AI was valued at nearly $200 billion and now it is expected to see an annual growth rate of 40% through the end of the decade.\n\nThis growth is prominent among software development teams. Research shows that 70% of software teams have adopted AI and 30% have implemented a strategy around it. These teams witness substantial gains in code writing velocity through AI. The numbers are proof. Software development teams with an effective AI adoption strategy are reporting an increase of 250% in the development speed.\n\nAI technology is not perfect; it has limits and drawbacks. For example, while AI may speed up code writing, it can also increase code churn -- and twice as much code means the possibility of twice as many mistakes. Popular developer platform GitHub recommends taking precautions when using code not written by a human. Whether a code is written by humans or GenAI, checking the code for quality is critical (aka a clean code approach).\n\nDespite this reality, some envision a near future of 'NoOps,' where the development community can fully depend on AI through advanced automation, self-healing systems and intelligent monitoring. That may one day become possible to an extent as technology continues to advance and evolve, but our current environment is not yet equipped for this.\n\nRight now, AI is not reliable or accurate enough to replace human developers and DevOps teams. The stakes are too high, and critical thinking and oversight are necessary for companies to start preparing for a time when AI takes over all IT operations. Believing otherwise puts your organization at risk for mistakes, poor-quality code and software and ultimately, business loss.\n\nWill AI ever fully replace developers? I lean toward a 'no'. But here are some things to consider when thinking about 'NoOps' and AI adoption.\n\nAI is the present and the future. Development teams cannot afford to miss out on the value AI provides or to fall behind in learning its different use cases, quirks and drawbacks. Developers and engineers of all roles and skill levels must be well-versed in using these GenAI tools. If they aren't, they can be left behind.\n\nThis is especially true as software becomes an even more critical business asset. Think about just how much we rely on technology in every aspect of our lives. The phones we use, the cars we drive, the smart devices we install in our homes -- all these are powered by software. This requires software companies that deliver that software to ensure their foundational code is clean, meaning it is secure, reliable, maintainable and of high quality.\n\nIt is not just developers who can derive value from AI tools. When used correctly, AI coding assistants can significantly impact the creation, management and testing of software and software infrastructure to benefit DevOps teams. For example, AI can be invaluable in the CI/CD process, streamlining it with greater automated capabilities for building, testing and deployment. AI can also integrate new code into an existing environment, which speeds up deployment as well as reduces the risk of error.\n\nAgility and efficiency are boosted through AI automation as well. It can take care of tedious tasks so that teams don't need to waste time on grunt work and can focus on priority projects. As AI can handle tedious and repetitive tasks, it reduces human error and allows teams to focus on work that benefits from human creativity, innovation and critical thinking.\n\nWith AI, developers can hone their code, ensuring quality in more complex parts of a project while reducing mistakes in ancillary pieces of code. Our reliance on software means code must be of high quality, which also means it is secure by design. Preventing cyberattacks reduces costly, reputation-threatening incidents, and AI can significantly aid in this effort.\n\nBut remember, AI is not perfect. It can help streamline DevOps and the development process and will continue to do so as the technology keeps improving. However, human oversight is an undeniable necessity in software. Companies cannot afford to implement AI without proper safeguards. It is not just about having the right tools, it is about ensuring you are using them in the right way and checking their work just as you would do with a human colleague.\n\nLike any emerging technology, AI needs guardrails. Teams and businesses must ensure that employees use AI in a way that does not compromise output, quality or the company's bottom line.\n\nThe reality is that you cannot replace human critical thinking with machine learning (ML) -- not now or anytime soon. Humans still have to be at the crux of vital decision-making in development and DevOps processes. For instance, AI lacks the context of a codebase; it may not understand what you are trying to achieve with a project. Its output cannot simply go into deployment without examination. You need a human safeguard.\n\nIn fact, researchers at Vectara, a GenAI platform founded by former Google employees, quantified AI hallucinations to understand the limitations and failures of this technology. They found chatbots invent things between 3% and 27% of the time. To clock these kinds of issues, they even keep a 'hallucination leaderboard' on GitHub. Think about how many times you have seen examples of AI chatbots and generators creating nonsensical content or responses to questions -- the same concerns apply to software development and DevOps.\n\nWorking with AI also requires transparency and accountability. You cannot trust that AI is pulling data from an unimpeachable source; you must be able to verify the origins of AI contributions to ensure their accuracy. Human teams also need to know what these tools can do: Their limitations, rules and specific use cases. This comes down to ensuring teams have proper education and training.\n\nIt is not enough though to just learn from current use cases. As these tools change and advance, the way we use them should also be evaluated consistently. Where are we seeing drawbacks? Improvements? Failures? How can we best use this technology right now? These are the kinds of open and honest conversations developers and DevOps teams should constantly have to learn from each other.\n\nWe have no way of predicting the future or knowing what AI will look like in five, 10 or 15 years -- which means we will always have to stay nimble and evolve alongside it. DevOps teams will need to continue refining and adapting best practices.\n\nAI now plays an unignorable, major part in the software landscape. As we move toward an AI-driven future, we need to keep understanding its implications and strive for the best outcome.\n\nAs we anticipate AI's growth and advancement over the next decade, it is important to recognize that we are not currently technologically equipped to grant these tools complete control over all processes. The idea of a 'NoOps' future is an intriguing one -- but for the time being, it is simply not viable. Just like we are not yet in a place where driverless cars are unquestionably safer alternatives to our vehicles, or we can fully trust chatbots to answer live chat questions correctly, AI coding assistants cannot simply run by themselves.\n\nDevelopers and DevOps teams cannot discount the need for human involvement in software. Like its human counterparts, AI is not perfect. Still, there is an undeniable opportunity at hand. We live in an exciting time of innovation and on the horizon of incredible transformation.

It also authorizes the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and creates testbeds with national labs to accelerate groundbreaking AI innovation to spur future economic growth and protect national security.\n\n\"The Future of AI Innovation Act encourages coordination between the U.S. government and industry to capitalize on the promise of AI to revolutionize our lives,\" said Senator Blackburn. \"The bill mobilizes the expertise of our National Laboratories, like Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to create testbeds for synthesizing new materials for AI systems. It would also require the identification of regulatory barriers to AI innovation and strengthens our national posture in standard setting bodies - making sure the government helps, rather than hinders, technological advancement. These policies will help us use AI to find solutions for important issues facing Americans today, including detecting fentanyl and illicit contraband and improving border security.\"\n\n\"The Cantwell-Young Future of AI Innovation Act builds on recommendations of the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee to encourage strong public-private collaboration, drive innovation and support U.S. competitiveness,\" said Senator Cantwell, Chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \"It codifies the AI Safety Institute at NIST that is already developing voluntary guidelines and tests for advanced AI models and systems, and will gather leading private sector and government experts to promote voluntary standards. Our bill will also create joint testbeds with our national laboratories to assess the most complex AI models, create new materials for advanced manufacturing and make new scientific discoveries for the benefit of the U.S. economy.\"\n\n\"The Future of AI Innovation Act is critical to maintaining American leadership in the global race to advance AI. This bipartisan bill will create important partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia to establish voluntary standards and best practices that will ensure a fertile environment for AI innovation while accounting for potential risks. One of my top priorities for federal AI policy is to ensure these technologies are developed in a manner that reflects our democratic values and supports innovation continuing to flourish in the United States, and today's vote represents an important step forward in that effort,\" said Senator Young.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF AI INNOVATION ACT:\n\nAuthorizes the NIST AI Safety Institute to Develop AI Standards: Formally establishes the AI Safety Institute at NIST to develop measurement science, voluntary guidelines, and rigorous testing for advanced AI models and systems to ensure AI reliability.\n\nCreates New AI Testbeds with National Laboratories to Evaluate AI Models and Make Discoveries that Benefit the U.S. Economy: Creates testbed programs between NIST, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the private sector to do in-depth evaluation of the most complex AI models and create new materials for advanced manufacturing.\n\nCreates Grand Challenge Prize Competitions to Spur Private Sector AI Solutions and Innovation: Grand challenges elevate and expedite high-priority projects and engage researchers across the country for the benefit of the nation's competitiveness. Grand challenges are aimed at overcoming barriers to the further development of AI and computing, microelectronics, advanced manufacturing, and other economic priorities like breakthroughs in maritime vessel propulsion systems and border security, including fentanyl and illegal drug detection.\n\nAccelerates AI Innovation with Publicly Available Datasets: Directs federal science agencies to make curated datasets available for public use to accelerate new advancements in AI applications, including solutions to global challenges in agriculture, medicine, transportation, manufacturing, and more. Unlocking datasets will help make discoveries in AI and benefit small and medium businesses that often don't have access to as much data.\n\nCreates International Alliances on AI Innovation and Standards: Directs the Department of Commerce, NSF, and Department of State to seek an alliance with the most technologically advanced, like-minded democracies to cooperate on AI innovation and standards.\n\nENDORSEMENTS:\n\nOn Monday, more than 45 leading tech organizations, companies, and AI safety policy advocates from across the AI community urged passage of the legislation to codify the U.S. AI Safety Institute at NIST.

It'll be convenient  --  and risky. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Google is at work on such a digital agent: Project Astra, which the company may begin making available to test customers in October. OpenAI is believed to be hard at work on a similar agent, as is Elon Musk's new AI company X.ai. So too are Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nFor all these companies, the motivation is the same: An AI agent may be the ultimate killer app, tech's equivalent of Sauron's Ring.\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates has said the first tech company to build a capable digital agent will be able to amass power -- and wealth -- that will dwarf what even today's largest technology companies command. \"Whoever wins the personal agent, that's the big thing, because you will never go to a search site again, never go to a productivity site again, you'll never go to Amazon again,\" he said at a tech conference last year.\n\nAI agents, in other words, will become our new interface to the digital world, to a large extent replacing the activities we currently perform through web browsers, apps, and other software.\n\nFor many people, access to an AI agent will be a tremendous convenience. In today's world, only the wealthiest among us can afford to employ a human personal assistant, able to handle the bits of our lives that we find time-consuming and unenjoyable. While some of us relish researching a vacation, many of us find the task of actually booking one stressful. A few might enjoy comparison shopping for a new car insurance policy or the best mortgage deal -- or, for that matter, a new vacuum cleaner or washing machine. But a lot of us could do without the mental lift and time required. The same goes for wrangling with health insurers over claims, doing our taxes, or puzzling out the best investment allocations. AI assistants will soon give every one of us a personal assistant able to take on these tasks and do much of the research, negotiation, emailing, and purchasing.\n\nBut AI assistants will present soaring new risks. To be effective, these assistants will need to know us and our preferences intimately. They will need access to most of our personal data. That means the data may be available to the technology companies building these AI assistants. We already chafe at the amount of personal information we have handed over to social media companies and how much they are able to learn about our preferences by collecting data on our online behavior. But to act on our behalf across the internet, an AI agent will need access to our mailing addresses, Social Security numbers, credit cards, bank balances, and loyalty points. It might need to know our kids' birthdays, what kind of food we like, our favorite colors or musicians, what fashions appeal to us, and more.\n\nHaving all this information in a single place -- stored either in the cloud or on our phones, laptops, or other devices -- will present an unprecedented cybersecurity risk. And a hacker who gains access to our AI agent could do more than simply steal our data. They could potentially take over the AI agent and max out our credit card, drain our bank account, or even perpetrate fraud under our name.\n\nIt is not only hackers that we'll need to worry about. Today's AI chatbots are based on a type of artificial neural network known as a transformer, which is trained on a vast dataset of text to predict the next word in a sentence. The first AI agents will also be based on transformers, except instead of predicting the next word, they will be trained to predict the next action in a sequence. Today's AI chatbots suffer from a phenomenon AI researchers call \"hallucination.\" That's when an AI model makes up information that seems plausible but is, in fact, erroneous. The danger of such hallucinations will grow exponentially with AI agents. Instead of merely making up some text, the agent could spend money or fill out critical forms with false information. It is unclear who will be legally liable for such mistakes -- the tech companies building and selling AI agents or the user who instructs an AI agent to perform a task.\n\nEven if AI agents work flawlessly, we need to decide if we want to give the tech companies building these agents so much power over the management of our lives. Research from Cornell University has shown that AI chatbots are highly persuasive. Interaction with a chatbot with a hidden point of view -- either deliberately implanted by its creators or inadvertently picked up from its training data -- can subtly alter our political beliefs, in a phenomenon that Cornell's Mor Naaman has dubbed \"latent persuasion.\"\n\nThis phenomenon becomes more worrisome when AI software has agency -- and possibly a profit motive. For instance, tech companies building such AI agents could allow brands to pay to make it more likely that our AI agents will suggest their products to us, or even make it more likely that they will buy those products on our behalf.\n\nThe internet is already polluted by fake customer reviews on sites such as Yelp and Amazon, paid links, and various search engine optimization tricks. AI agents may struggle to cut through this morass to find accurate information and make good choices on our behalf. And allowing brands to pay to make it more likely that chatbots and AI assistants will recommend their products to us would make this problem even worse. If I send my future AI agent out to research and then buy the best running shoes for me, I want it to choose the ones suited to my workout routine and taste -- not simply the shoes that Nike or Hoka has paid the AI developer to sell me.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and other regulators should insist that the companies building AI agents use business models, such as subscriptions, that have a chance of aligning with user interests. At the very least, regulators should insist on transparency. When the creator of an AI agent has been paid by a brand, the user should be clearly informed of that fact and have the chance to explore other options.\n\nWe must also be careful about how much we rely on AI agents. If they become our primary means of accessing the internet and conducting e-commerce, it is likely that the internet will increasingly be designed for these digital systems and not for human consumption. \"Search engine optimization,\" or SEO, has, to some extent, already warped the way the internet operates and made it more difficult in some cases to find quality information. But \"AI agent optimization\" could take this phenomenon to an extreme. Humans may increasingly find it difficult to use the internet directly, even if we want to. Such dependency should worry us.\n\nIn P.G. Wodehouse's famous novels of manners from the first half of the 20th century, the wealthy and indolent Bertie Wooster is depicted as completely dependent on his intelligent personal valet, Jeeves. Wooster and his fellow aristocrats are infantilized, and sometimes controlled, by their trusty servants. Soon the rise of AI agents may turn us all into Bertie Woosters.

The bad news: Flaws and vulnerabilities are beginning to appear that could foreshadow major problems ahead.\n\nThat was the prevailing sentiment expressed by numerous research analysts and industry executives at the Black Hat USA cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas this week. AI may be relatively new to many threat actors, but the technology industry's familiarity with AI has provided it with a certain measure of protection... so far.\n\n\"My view right now, when you think about AI versus AI, is that the defense is winning,\" Chris Krebs, a SentinelOne Inc. executive and former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said during an appearance at Black Hat's inaugural AI Summit on Tuesday. \"We are seeing some leading-edge capabilities that are actually working. In the state actor space... they are still messing around with what works. The defense is still outpacing the offense.\"\n\nSome of those leading-edge capabilities involve added support for security analysts. AI can take the pressure off weary personnel in security operations centers who suffer from alert overload. It can also provide operational insight much more rapidly, according to Alex Stamos, chief information security officer at SentinelOne and former chief security officer for Facebook and Yahoo.\n\n\"The best defensive use of generative AI is analyst efficiency,\" Stamos told SiliconANGLE. \"'Show me all of my laptops that have talked to a Russian IP address in the last 24 hours.' It's taking normal smart humans and upleveling them into super analysts.\"\n\nThis notion of leveraging AI to provide critical source data has been taken a step further by Dataminr Inc. The 15-year-old company, reported to be preparing for an initial public offering, began using AI in 2018 to integrate descriptions of what its global network of sensors was detecting.\n\nIn 2022, Datminr was selected by the Defense Information Systems Agency to provide social media monitoring information to the White House. The firm's generative AI capabilities received a demonstration in July when Datminr began to pick up signals from social media posts about issues with Microsoft Windows. The service provided early alerts that summarized the narrative in what emerged as the CrowdStrike global outage.\n\n\"Generative AI has the capability to be tied into predictive AI systems to automatically describe the signals in front of you,\" Ted Bailey, Dataminr's founder and chief executive, said in a presentation during Black Hat's AI Summit.\n\nThe looming problem is that current spending on AI far outpaces investment in security to protect it. Dave Dewalt, chief executive of NightDragon and former CEO of FireEye and McAfee, noted during the AI Summit that there had been $67 billion in AI investments over just the past 12 months.\n\n\"Take a guess of how much security investment has gone into this in the same amount of time,\" Dewalt said. \"About $300 million. We have to catch up security to AI. We can't let that gap be there.\"\n\nGaps are already being exposed by security practitioners in how generative AI models are protected. Researchers from Wiz Inc. presented a report at Black Hat on Wednesday detailing how they breached model repositories in AI as-a-service providers Hugging Face, Replicate and SAP. They reported their exploits to all three companies, which have since corrected the vulnerabilities disclosed.\n\n\"We were able to get access to millions of public and private AI models... and we had the ability to interfere with all this data,\" said Hillai Ben Sasson, a security researcher at Wiz. \"This is confidential data we should not have been able to access.\"\n\nSecurity researchers are finding that because the AI attack surface is relatively new, it will take some time to pinpoint where the protection is needed. Nvidia Corp. has been testing weaknesses in large language model structures and found that retrieval-augmented generation or RAG plugins can be especially vulnerable.\n\n\"You can specifically target models for poisoning people on their results if you have access to a specific RAG store,\" said Rich Harang, principal security architect at Nvidia. \"Unfortunately, this is just how RAG works. Limit the data that you have that RAG applications have access to.\"\n\nWhile the security community is focusing on AI models, there is also growing concern around the data that fuels them. Jennifer Gold, head of threat intelligence for the FBI-driven public/private collaboration New York Metro InfraGard, noted that ChatGPT and Copilot data had been found on platforms used in the dark web.\n\nOne Singapore-based cybersecurity firm reported that more than 225,000 logs containing compromised ChatGPT credentials were available for sale in the underground. That could potentially open new pathways of threats as malicious actors are able to tap into data stores that were not readily available before.\n\n\"Lots of companies are focused, rightfully so, on threats to models,\" Steve Stone, head of Zero Labs at Rubrik Inc., told SiliconANGLE. \"I'm concerned about the data. If organizations are already struggling with their data today... what happens when they have seven times that data? I am deeply concerned that you have a bunch of threat actors that are able to find a much deeper data surface.\"\n\nHistory is not necessarily on the security community's side for getting ahead of the curve when a technology wave comes ashore. The world's embrace of the internet spawned a whole new class of threats and disruptions that is still playing out. Mobile platforms have become prime targets in recent years, with reported deepfake attacks on banking apps and other smartphone exploits.\n\n\"Are we handling AI functionally different than any new technology?\" Stone said. \"I don't think we are. We probably have already had a really nasty AI intrusion that we don't even know about.\"\n\nThis possibility is drawing renewed attention from regulators. Representatives from several government agencies were part of the speaker lineup at Black Hat this week and several expressed concern that, in the urgency to pile onto the AI bandwagon, businesses are not thoroughly testing deployments.\n\n\"I am concerned about ways that people are rushing to get AI products to market without safety and security testing,\" said Lisa Einstein, newly appointed chief AI officer for CISA. \"We see people not being really clear about the ways that security can be brought in.\"\n\nGovernments are becoming increasingly more motivated to develop a regulatory framework around AI. IDC has reported that 60% of governments worldwide will adopt a risk management approach to framing generative AI policies by 2028.\n\n\"It is going to be a really rich enforcement ecosystem,\" said former CISA head Krebs.\n\nMuch as AI has accelerated the pace of many applications, it has also contributed to a sense within the security community that the threat landscape is shifting rapidly as well. Previous technology waves of adoption have allowed security researchers time to analyze the data and craft ways to combat escalating attacks. Yet, as Black Hat founder Jeff Moss told the gathering in his conference keynote on Wednesday, there is an uneasy feeling that this rapidly advancing wave is going to be very different.\n\n\"We've got this giant bucket of other problems that's making it feel like things are speeding up,\" Moss said. \"It just feels like it's different and it feels like it's getting different faster.\"", "source":

Growing up the son of a proprietary stock trader and educator, Daniel's always found joy in helping Canadians to improve their financial situations. With the Motley Fool, Daniel sees an even more rewarding way to impact Canadians positively. A student and great admirer of Warren Buffett, he's always looking for investments offering growth at a reasonable price. Outside of finance, Daniel enjoys spending his time with family, sailing, and watching Formula One.\n\nOver the last year, the AI revolution has been creating a tonne of optimism across various sectors. AI technology has been around for years now, but ever since the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, the potential of AI has become more evident, creating high interest in AI stocks from savvy investors.\n\nIn addition, with technology rapidly improving and more companies joining the party, increased competition is only accelerating the pace of innovation.\n\nThis surge in AI development is not only transforming industries but also driving stock market performance, which has been particularly noticeable given the uncertain environment in both the stock market and the economy over the last year.\n\nThere's no question that AI's potential is significant, and its broad scope has made it one of the most exciting investment opportunities of our time. So, it's unsurprising that many investors are eagerly seeking ways to capitalize on AI stocks.\n\nThe good news is that investors have plenty of opportunities to invest in stocks that stand to benefit significantly from AI advancements.\n\nSo, while it may seem too late to invest in some AI stocks, especially the well-known giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which have already experienced massive rallies and now trade at high valuations, there are still numerous opportunities to invest in the AI boom.\n\nFor example, companies that successfully integrate AI into their business models can experience substantial profitability and growth.\n\nSo, if you're looking to gain exposure to AI's potential, here are two top Canadian stocks to consider adding to your portfolio today.\n\nWhile there are plenty of high-quality stocks that can benefit from the adoption of AI, one of the best Canadian stocks to consider today is Thomson Reuters (TSX:TRI). Thomson Reuters is a massive $97 billion stock that provides information services, and is known for its expertise in delivering news, financial data, and technology solutions to various industries.\n\nThe stock is strategically positioned to benefit from advancements in AI, especially as it integrates Generative AI into its software and workflow solutions to enhance efficiency.\n\nSo, while Thomson Reuters is a massive, well-known company with a lengthy track record of consistent and, more importantly, stable growth, the stock is also ideal for investors looking for exposure to AI.\n\nFor example, it has recently launched Checkpoint Edge with CoCounsel in its Tax and Accounting business and continues to integrate acquisitions like Pagero, SurePrep, and CaseText, enhancing its AI capabilities. Furthermore, Thomson Reuters has its own in-house venture fund, focusing on emerging technologies and AI for workflow automation.\n\nTherefore, investing in Thomson Reuters not only allows you to own one of the best stocks in Canada earning tonnes of recurring revenue and consistently increasing its dividend, but it also provides exposure to AI advancements and positions investors to benefit from the company's strategic focus on continuously integrating AI into its core operations.\n\nEven before Thomson Reuters began using AI to drive efficiency and profitability, it was already one of the best long-term growth stocks you could own on the TSX. However, the one downside of Thomson Reuters is its massive size, with a market cap of just shy of $100 billion.\n\nSo, while it continues to have a tonne of growth potential, due to its sheer size already, the pace of growth could be limited in the coming years.\n\nTherefore, if you're looking for a stock to buy that offers exposure to AI and could have significant growth potential, I'd consider WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) and its current market cap of just $1.1 billion.\n\nWELL is a leading digital health company that also owns and operates a network of outpatient medical clinics across Canada, where it has already integrated three key AI-powered solutions: WELL AI Voice, WELL AI Decision Support, and WELL AI Inbox Admin.\n\nThese tools have already drastically improved clinical workflows, saving practitioners over two hours per day, detecting over 110 rare and complex diseases early, and reducing administrative tasks by over 15 hours per week.\n\nTherefore, as it continues to expand its operations, improve efficiency and scale its costs, WELL is certainly one of the top Canadian stocks offering exposure to AI to buy now.", "source": {"uri": "fool.ca",

This dramatic surge is being fueled by a number of causes. The primary growth driver is the enhancement of existing cybersecurity tools through generative AI algorithms by improving anomaly detection, automating threat hunting and penetration testing, and providing complex simulations for security testing purposes. These techniques enable various cyber attack scenarios that can be simulated using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), thus enabling the development of better preparedness and response strategies. On the other hand, it requires special cyber security tools to protect generative AI workloads against unique vulnerabilities such as adversarial attacks, model inversions and LLM poisoning. These tools include differential privacy and secure multi-party computation that are integrated into AI systems for training and deployment data protection purposes.\n\nGenerative AI apps security segment will account for largest market share during the forecast period.\n\nThe cybersecurity landscape is rapidly changing for generative AI apps, which are already making their way into chatbots, content creation tools like word processors, and personalized recommendation systems. According to McAfee, 55% of these programs have had security breaches.\n\nThis highlights the dire need for stronger protective measures from unauthorized access. Several generative AI applications that use adversarial techniques to force the desired reaction out of intelligent machines. Therefore, there is a pressing demand in the number of developers who ensure that such machines are made more robust through techniques like adversarially trained models and resistant architectures. Finally, the usage of secure enclaves plus hardware-based security measures is off late, mainly aimed at safeguarding vulnerable AI computations from being tampered with. For instance, OpenAI has very strict security rules meant to protect GPT models thereby ensuring data integrity and user privacy.\n\nBy end-user, government & defense sector is poised to account for larger market share in 2024.\n\nGovernment as well as defense industries are increasingly resorting to generative AI for cyber security purposes due to the urgency of protecting sensitive information and national security. According to a recent CSIS report, AI is being integrated into the cybersecurity framework of 43% of government agencies which resultantly improves their ability to identify and counter threats. As an example, the United States Department of Defense has started using artificial intelligence (AI) based security solutions backed by generative AI that can create fictitious cyber-attacks, thereby providing them with enhanced preparedness against advanced types of threats. This technology also helps these sectors handle and analyze large volumes of data more effectively, giving valuable insights that will enable them prevent or mitigate cyber threats. This trend demonstrates an increasing reliance on generative AI in fortifying cyber security measures so as to ensure that critical infrastructure and sensitive data remain secure in today's intricate digital landscape.\n\nRequest For Sample Report: www.marketsandmarkets.com/request...gn=paid+pr\n\nBy region, North America to hold the largest share by market value in 2024\n\nIn 2024, North America will be the leading region based on market share due to its excellent technology infrastucture, substantial investments in AI-enabled cybersecurity and the presence of key players. Major cyber security research universities and tech companies such as Google, AWS, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne and IBM are present in this area, pushing them on the forefront of potent risk management technologies and generative AI tools for threat detection. For example, IBM's security platform powered by AI has improved detection rates for threats up by 40%, thus proving the relevance of AI technology to enhancing cybersecurity. Moreover, legislative instruments such as Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) are being put in place to promote advanced cybersecurity technologies. As internet attacks continue getting more complicated, North American enterprises prefer generative artificial intelligence (AI), so as to enhance their safety measures pertaining to personal data and digital infrastructure.\n\nNews From MarketsandMarkets\u2122\n\nCategory: Industry Reports & Market Analysis Profile: About MarketsandMarkets\u2122 MarketsandMarkets\u2122 has been recognized as one of America's best management consulting firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.

Yet, businesses remain cautious about going all in.\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively new technology. Around 56% of executives view its integration in software development workflows as potentially risky. On the other hand, 46% of early AI coding assistant adopters claim a 5-10% revenue growth.\n\nIndustry leaders like Toyota, Coca-Cola, Mercedes-Benz, EY, and Capgemini have already implemented AI coding tools for in-house teams and reported significant productivity gains.\n\nWhen it comes to AI in software development, it's all shades of gray. The end value will depend greatly on the selected use cases, team skillsets, and overall engineering process maturity.\n\nIn this post, we will discuss the benefits and limitations of AI in software development and share some best practices from early adopters.\n\nAI in software development: what does it mean for the tech industry?\n\nAI in software development involves implementing new automation technologies, such as machine learning models, deep learning, and generative AI, to speed up everyday software engineering tasks.\n\nIn most cases, it assumes the adoption of AI coding assistants. These tools are based on large language models (LLMs) specifically trained to interpret, explain, generate, and edit code. Trained on a database of code snippets, these AI assistants can reproduce the syntax and coding patterns of the most popular programming languages. Some can also adapt the outputs to your coding standards.\n\nThese capabilities make AI coding assistants the talk of the town in the software engineering community. More than 70% of developers already use or plan to use gen AI tools as part of their development workflow, and almost 77% see this as a positive step. Below are the most popular use cases developers report.\n\nUse cases of AI in software development\n\nSoftware developers are eager to adopt AI coding assistants because they can significantly accelerate and automate software delivery. These tools augment developers' skills and remove a lot of low-value, repetitive tasks.\n\nFor example, instead of generating boilerplate code or doing manual code reviews, developers can dedicate their time to writing new code, creating original solutions to problems, and learning new skills. Yet, there are many more use cases where software engineers use Gen AI tools.\n\nAI can potentially transform how fast and smoothly software engineering teams create, test, and deploy new software. According to McKinsey, developer productivity can increase by up to 45% when using AI coding tools. In particular, gen AI can accelerate code documentation by 45-50% and refactoring by 20-30%.\n\nEarly adopters report the following benefits of using Gen AI in their software development lifecycle:\n\nChallenges of implementing AI in software development\n\nAlthough there are gains, AI adoption in a software development process is not without stumbling blocks. And it's far from being mainstream. Only 13% of organizations implemented AI in their software engineering workflows.\n\nWhy such a precaution?\n\nThe same study says that 95% of C-level decision-makers prioritize AI coding assistants that can reliably protect their privacy and intellectual property.\n\nSome other valid concerns of AI-assisted coding include:\n\nLike any other tech innovation, AI adoption for software engineering doesn't automatically lead to increased productivity, speed, profit, or other positive outcomes. The effectiveness of an AI coding assistant depends on how you implement and use it, bringing out its strengths and managing its limitations.\n\n7 best practices for adopting AI in software development\n\nThe adoption of AI in software development requires careful planning. It's not enough to select the most popular AI coding assistant, demonstrate it to your development teams, and then expect results in several months. You must train your engineers, implement robust security controls, and establish governance standards. This is no easy task, especially for larger IT departments.\n\nThe key to ensuring that AI benefits your entire software delivery process is to adopt it strategically, starting with a small-scale pilot project and gradually expanding it to the whole company.\n\nStart with a proof of concept deployment like Duolingo and PayPal did, then work up to scaling your AI-assisted engineering program. Here's how to do so:\n\n1. Establish goals for adopting AI in software development\n\nIdentifying your reasons for adopting AI is the first step. Be specific and think about desired outcomes. Do you want to launch more features, reduce tech debt, or curb the volume of security incidents? A clear, measurable objective will help you quantify the results.\n\nMake sure your AI implementation strategy adds value both to your software engineering team and executive leaders. There must be a willingness to accept change from developers and a green light for initiative from C-level representatives. Here's a tip for each group:\n\n2. Evaluate AI coding assistants\n\nAI-assisted development tools aren't in short supply. There are enterprise offers from big tech companies like Amazon Q Developer or Microsoft Copilot, as well as innovative products from seed-funded startups like Wispr and Replit. Some products offer specialized security coding and testing tools, while others cover general software development tasks.\n\nHere are the top 10 code assistant tools used by professional developers as of May 2024:\n\nSource: Stack Overflow\n\nWith so many options available, selecting an AI code generation tool can be tricky. To simplify the process, keep these criteria in mind:\n\nMany AI coding tool vendors offer demos, free trials, or freemium versions of their products, so you can test several options before committing.\n\n3. Onboard the first group of developers\n\nAI coding assistants need the right input from your developers -- a solid code base and relevant conversational prompts. Developers will also need to determine if the suggested code snippets actually work, have no security vulnerabilities, and don't change system behavior or business logic.\n\nThat's why, for your pilot projects, it's best to select senior or middle-level software engineers with sufficient skill to evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\n\nAlso, provide adequate AI training for your pilot team. AI coding assistants are a relatively new phenomenon, and even experienced developers might not be familiar with their functionality. Also, you might need to train developers on best practices for prompt writing (accurate task descriptions, project context, expected output, etc.).\n\nBefore launching the pilot program, you must decide on the metrics for measuring whether the AI assistant benefits or hinders the productivity of your development team.\n\nCalculating the sheer volume of performed work might be misleading: a lot of bad-quality, unreadable code is not conducive to good pilot project performance. Measuring code quality on its own also has limitations. To ensure AI-generated code works well, your developers might have to spend a lot of time testing and editing it.\n\nInstead, select a more insightful approach to measure performance from different angles, as PayPal did during their early adoption of DUET (now Gemini). They evaluated:\n\nUnsurprisingly, PayPal's metrics match those that developers themselves suggest using for performance measurements. Code quality and time are the top two criteria, according to the tech community surveyed by GitHub.\n\nIntroduce AI tools to a limited group of developers and focus on specific use cases (code generation, refactoring, boilerplate coding, etc.). Later, you can apply acquired knowledge and experience to either scale the initiative company-wide, select another platform, or even postpone the adoption until the technology matures.\n\nForm two test groups -- an AI-assisted cohort and a regular one. Assign each team with similar tasks and make sure they have the same starting point (like clean GitHub and Jira Instances).\n\nTo ensure your pilot project is secure, PayPal's senior director of product management, Jarred Keneally, suggests working in isolated sandbox environments and practicing on non-proprietary code. Also, make sure to continually measure performance against the previously established criteria.\n\nAccenture started testing GitHub Copilot with just 20 developers. Then, the company decided to hold a randomized controlled trial (RCT), measuring the performance of 450 developers who used AI and comparing the results to 200 developers who did not. Accenture saw an increase in successful builds, pull requests, and software updates, further unrolling the AI initiative for 12,000 developers.\n\n6. Collect feedback and evaluate the results\n\nContinuous feedback loops are crucial to understanding if the selected AI coding tool works for your use case. Collect both positive and negative feedback from pilot project participants -- and do so throughout and after the project.\n\nFor a 360-degree view of the pilot, collect both qualitative (interpretation-based experience of your teams) and quantitative data (measured time, quality, and volume of code). We recommend the following activities for measuring results:\n\nMost importantly, be on the lookout for productivity loopholes, where the AI tool improves performance in one aspect but adds significantly more work elsewhere. For instance, code generation time may be down, but developers may now have too much testing to do.\n\nThe GitHub resource portal also suggests the following metrics to measure the impact of an AI coding assistant: suggestions delivered, number of acceptances, lines of code accepted, total completed pull requests, time to merge, total successful builds, and others.\n\nEY, for instance, measured the success of their AI adoption pilot projects in lines of code committed. Within several weeks, 150 developers generated more than 1.2 million lines of code with the help of an AI coding assistant.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Australia Bank measured code acceptance rates, indicating that their developers took in 50% of code suggestions generated by an AI tool.\n\n7. Scale the initiative across the whole department and lifecycle\n\nGradually scale the initiative department-wide, training more developers, covering new use cases, and creating onboarding materials for them. Continue measuring the performance of your development teams and gather feedback to see if the program is scaling well and bringing expected results long-term.\n\nIn time, you might want to scale your AI adoption for the whole software development lifecycle. As per KPMG, AI-powered tools can be used at every stage, from planning to maintenance. Here's how:\n\nEthical considerations for adopting AI in software development\n\nAI adoption also requires a solid legal framework. Make sure the tools, methods, and practices you adopt do not violate AI regulations. EU's AI Act, for instance, applies to all EU-based natural or legal persons using AI systems professionally.\n\nTo ensure the safe and ethical use of AI in your software development workflows, consider assembling a dedicated AI committee. This working group, consisting of experts in law, compliance, privacy, and information security, will guide you in developing, testing, and deploying AI-generated code responsibly.\n\nInitially, this group can help you analyze the security and privacy settings of selected AI coding assistants. It can suggest whether you need to have extra legal clauses with your clients or vendors -- some may restrict the use of certain data or tools, while others might forbid using AI at all.\n\nFinally, the committee can help you create a code of conduct for the human-centered use of AI.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGenerative AI can add value to your software development processes, reducing routine tasks and empowering your teams to work smarter, not harder. What's more, the technology offers almost limitless flexibility and scaling potential.\n\nMcKinsey states that market leaders use gen AI in three or more business functions while their less prominent competitors use it in two. Once you've seen the potential of AI based on the software development pilot project, you can consider bringing automation to other functions like marketing, sales, and HR.\n\nTo streamline work further, collaborate with a strategic technology partner who can provide consulting and specialized knowledge on AI adoption -- not only for software engineering but for all organizational functions. Select someone you can trust to guide you in the right direction and help you create and execute the whole AI adoption plan.\n\nFind out how AI is setting new standards and driving the future of

It undoubtedly redefines how everything works while rendering some professionals jobless. For instance, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang claims coding might be dead in the water as a plausible career option for the next generation with the rapid prevalence of AI.\n\nElon Musk (who's heavily invested in the tech) pointed out that we might be on the verge of the biggest technology breakthrough, though this benchmark might not be realized because of its high power demand. While AI has opened up the world to endless opportunities and untapped potential, its hype might be short-lived, with challenges abounding.\n\nAside from its high water and power demands, recent studies show that AI might be a fad and further claim that 30% of its projects will be abandoned after proof of concept. Similar sentiments are echoed in a recent Blood In The Machine newsletter, which points out critical issues that might potentially lead to \"the beginning of the end of the generative AI boom.\"\n\nFrom the Blood in the Machine newsletter analysis by Brian Merchant, who is also the Los Angeles Times' technology columnist:\n\n\"This is it. Generative AI, as a commercial tech phenomenon, has reached its apex. The hype is evaporating. The tech is too unreliable, too often. The vibes are terrible. The air is escaping from the bubble. To me, the question is more about whether the air will rush out all at once, sending the tech sector careening downward like a balloon that someone blew up, failed to tie off properly, and let go -- or, more slowly, shrinking down to size in gradual sputters, while emitting embarrassing fart sounds, like a balloon being deliberately pinched around the opening by a smirking teenager.\"\n\nLater, Merchant calls generative AI one big \"meh\" and remarks, \"Enterprise AI was supposed to be the big moneymaker for generative AI firms, and now it's increasingly clear that it isn't adding much efficiency, at best, and is outright counterproductive at worst.\"\n\nMicrosoft was recently placed on the spot by its investors for throwing large sums of money into AI-themed investors with little to show in profits. NVIDIA is arguably one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as the demand for AI chips is at an all-time high. The AI hype pushed the chip brand to the top three most valuable companies in the world and, at some point, helped it surpass Microsoft and Apple to claim the coveted crown.\n\nHowever, recent developments indicated that the chip manufacturer might have encountered some critical issues, including the delay of its long-awaited Blackwell chips, which will likely impact its market and stock performance. NVIDIA's stock has already taken a significant hit and dropped by 5%. However, CEO Jensen Huang claims the issue will be resolved soon.\n\nInterestingly, market experts and analysts believe this is just the beginning. NVIDIA's value could decline significantly in the next few months. While we've been in the AI bubble for nearly two years, there's little to show except AI-powered tools like Copilot and ChatGPT.\n\nIts real impact remains debatable, depending on which side of the expensive coin you're looking at. NVIDIA CEO believes we're well beyond AI-powered chatbots and could be on the brink of the next phase of AI with self-driving cars and humanoid robots.\n\nThe mass exodus of top executives from OpenAI is also highly concerning. OpenAI is arguably the face of AI, but CEO Sam Altman is one of the remaining few founding members of the ChatGPT maker. The latest exit featured researcher John Schulman, who joined rival firm Anthropic to focus on \"AI alignment.\"\n\nAside from the management issues, billionaire Elon Musk recently refiled a lawsuit against OpenAI and Sam Altman for a stark betrayal of the firm's founding mission. The lawsuit also alleged involvement in racketeering. Musk says OpenAI used a \"fake humanitarian mission\" to get funds for AI advances. The billionaire says OpenAI's latest AI models constitute AGI, which breaches its current partnership agreement with Microsoft.\n\nElsewhere, OpenAI is reportedly on the verge of bankruptcy, with projections of making a $5 billion loss within the next 12 months. Analysts suggest that the firm might need additional funding to remain afloat.\n\nIronically, ChatGPT had its best month yet on mobile and pulled $28 million in revenue in July, according to Appfigures. This builds up on the hype created by OpenAI's GPT-4o launch in May, contributing to the biggest spike in revenue and downloads.\n\nSeveral reports indicated AI will eventually end humanity. An AI researcher shared p(doom) values of the probability of this happening, and it's alarmingly high, with a 99.9% probability. The researcher indicated the only way to reverse this outcome is by not building AI in the first place.

Discussion groups, webinars, conferences, email newsletters -- it's the subject everyone wants to talk about.\n\nWhile the excitement and hype seem to be glaringly present in these virtual forums, it's a sharp contrast to the level of interest and utilization we're seeing in the real world. For example, within our own customer base, we've had requests from less than 1% of eligible customers to enable Microsoft Copilot.\n\nAdmittedly, we've been encouraging our customers to pace themselves with AI adoption, primarily to ensure they focus on reviewing and implementing security and data privacy measures before giving generative AI unrestricted access to their environment. But if our customer base is in any way a representation of the broader marketplace, then perhaps we should be thinking about why. There are a few obvious reasons that come to mind.\n\nTools and applications based on artificial intelligence are inherently newcomers to the market, which means they are still very much in development. We've seen continuous upgrades, staggered rollouts and feature enhancements across various AI-driven platforms as developers take advantage of and adjust to discovered benefits and challenges along the way.\n\nFurthermore, many AI tools publish extensive roadmaps -- meaning with all the capabilities and concerns we continue to learn about generative AI, there's no real end in sight. That reality can make it hard to justify the cost and may be why some business leaders aren't rushing to adopt.\n\nOne benefit of generative AI that seems quite evident is that it can help users increase their daily productivity. In the case of Copilot, you can transcribe notes from a meeting you weren't able to join or manage your inbox by summarizing email content and generating action items. Productivity hacks such as these can be helpful to the average user who spends a significant portion of their day using these tools.\n\nBut it's also important to consider the price of these generative AI platforms and whether you're able to earn that money back. Even if a set of employees can achieve an increased level of productivity using the provided capabilities, ensuring that this saved time is being invested back into the business is critical.\n\nSecurity and data privacy remain perhaps the most critical barrier to AI adoption. The reality is that generative AI tools, which are built into the seeds of your organization's daily communication and collaboration efforts, cannot operate under the guise of \"set it and forget it.\"\n\nA comprehensive data governance strategy is required to effectively leverage the tool's capabilities without sacrificing security. This means implementing and maintaining strong data management safeguards such as access control permissions and content sharing restrictions.\n\nSo, is generative AI integration all hype, or is there still hope for it to be a transformative business tool? I'm still of the \"wait and see\" mindset and would strongly urge business and IT leaders to adopt a similar outlook, giving companies additional time to enhance these tools and address ongoing security and data privacy concerns.\n\nFor the curious customers, I advise diligent testing -- preferably by only C-level or other privileged roles inside the organization. In the event that data is not classified properly, there is more limited risk of data exposure.\n\nIf you're eager to adopt generative AI tools sooner rather than later, here are a few thoughtful questions to ask yourself first.\n\n* What budget are you willing to spend to increase productivity without fully understanding how to measure ROI?\n\n* How do you intend for your employees to utilize AI tools, and have you established an acceptable use policy to dictate appropriate usage?\n\n* Have you or do you intend to train your employees on proper prompt procedure and basic AI capabilities and considerations?\n\n* Have you completed a full data and security audit and established a data governance strategy to ensure appropriate permission structures and data privacy measures?\n\n* Is it worth waiting another 6, 12 or 18 months to see how certain features and broader AI technology evolve?\n\nI fully expect that AI-driven tools will find their footing and begin to demonstrate more robust and transformative applications in the near future. There's still a lot of hope, but for now, I believe hype may be winning the battle.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

This coupled with an intentional approach to skilling is crucial to succeed in the age of generative AI.\"\n\nTo fully leverage the potential of generative AI, Accenture recommends that businesses take the following steps:\n\nLead and learn in new ways: To be effective and build trust in the generative AI-enabled future, leaders need to engage, lead differently and challenge old mindsets to learn new things. It is important that leaders immerse themselves in the technology, effectively changing how they learn by embedding learning into the flow of work.\n\nReinvent work: By rethinking entire workflows, leaders can gain a clear view of where generative AI can be most impactful, aligning it with business goals for better efficiency and innovation across the enterprise and collapsing silos in a lasting, meaningful way. From there, it's possible to re-focus on how the work needs to change to better serve customers, support people and achieve business outcomes.\n\nReshape the workforce: The shift in how work is done demands a dynamic and adaptable workforce. Organisations need to prioritize continuous talent reinvention. As use of this technology grows, organisations should further leverage tools and technologies, such as skills mapping, that can help facilitate smoother transitions from declining to emerging roles. And as work and roles shift, increased capacity can free up time and talent for higher value activities.\n\nPrepare workers: As organisations invest in helping workers acquire market-relevant technical skills and the capability to collaborate with machines, they will also need to focus on soft skills. A teach-to-learn model is emerging to equip workers to teach the machines. Along this journey, leaders also need to listen and involve their people at every step of the way to strengthen trust.\n\nTo estimate the working hours likely to be impacted by gen AI and the associated impact on GDP, Accenture looked at data from four of the five largest economies in APAC - Australia, China, Japan and India:\n\n-Breakdown jobs into tasks which we then tagged according to potential for automation and augmentation (using machine learning with human verification\n\n-Used economic literature to estimate the total hours saved based on current state of generative AI\n\n-Explored likely job transitions (based on historical trends and similarities in skill composition)\n\n-Built out different scenarios of how organisations could adopt generative AI across three parameters: innovation focus, pace of adoption, and degree of talent displacement.\n\n-Modelled GDP growth (2023-2038) for each geography under each scenario (which we compared against baseline GDP growth projections)", "source": {"uri": "crn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "CRN - India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "crn_team@crn.in", "name": "Crn Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.crn.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/06203413/CRN_Technology_Services_Portfolio_696.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

LESS ... MORE\n\nIf you are a WhatsApp user you can't miss the \"Ask Meta AI or Search\" button in place of the usual search button which one uses to search their data. This action by default prompts you to use their service even if you did not want to. Does it also mean your entire data is used to train Meta AI? Quite Probable. Look around X (formerly known as Twitter), it has openly admitted that it uses X data for training Elon Musk's other AI company (x.AI) which is building its own foundation models and ChatGPT-like bot interface. I can keep giving examples like this but you get the message!\n\nThere was a joke in the 2000s - if it is free, you are the product. Never has it been more true than ever today. Platforms like Meta, X, Microsoft, Alphabet and others have grown into colossal AI factories which are quietly harvesting your data to train their own artificial intelligence systems. Every click, like, and share is a piece of the puzzle, helping these systems become smarter, faster, and more effective. Every time you interact with an app, you're feeding it data which gives more context about you and your demographic insights. This includes everything from the text you write, photos you upload, the comments you leave, to even the time you spend on a particular content piece. This data is extremely valuable to platforms helping them build user persona, demographic level information and target ads and various products and services to you.\n\nAll of this has been around for a while and we have quietly accepted it as a way of life but the real cause of concern lies in how this data can be used to train AI models. AI algorithms thrive on vast and diverse datasets, and there's no better source than the\n\nendless stream of user data generated by billions of people worldwide. Here's where things get uncomfortable. While you're consuming a free product and giving away your data, these platforms are amassing unprecedented powers. These platforms have more insight into human behaviour than any government or institution ever has. They know what you like, who you interact with, and even what you're likely to do next. There was an interesting article many years ago titled \"Google Will Know I'm Pregnant Before I Do\". This power imbalance raises serious ethical concerns. We have no idea just how much of our life is being monitored, recorded, and analyzed.\n\nThe ethical implications of using user data to train AI go beyond privacy concerns. This training data is not always representative or unbiased, which can lead to AI systems that perpetuate and even amplify societal biases. For example, AI models trained on biased data can make discriminatory decisions in areas like recruitment, money lending, targeting and law enforcement.\n\nSo, the question remains. What option does a user have? One needs to be on a platform where enough social validation has occurred and a peers network exists. Can one control the narrative or data governance of such a platform? Not really. Is Privacy\n\nso important that one denounces such platforms and the benefits they offer? The question arises of how much we really value our privacy and how much are we willing to be arm-twisted for free services and for convenience. The only ray of hope is tight regulations-led governance but Big Tech has always given a Big Thumbs up (pun intended) to such rules and openly tailored their ambitions around it. Until then, remember that every time you click \"I agree,\" you're not just giving away data -- you're helping to build the AI systems that may one day know you better than you know yourself. And that's a high price to pay for convenience.\n\nIs there such a thing called absolute data ownership and privacy and what price tag would you put on it?

This breakthrough technology can comprehend and communicate in natural language, aiding the creation of personalized customer interactions and immersive virtual experiences while supplementing employee capabilities.\n\nWhat sets generative AI apart from traditional AI is not just the ability to generate new data from existing patterns. With generative AI businesses can now boost productivity and reduce costs, fundamentally changing how they work.\n\nHere's how four generative AI use cases are changing the business landscape:\n\nCompanies are turning to AI-powered tools like chatbots, copilots, or virtual assistants to improve productivity and customer experiences. These tools integrate generative AI with a company's own data for precise responses, allowing the creation of customized virtual assistants that can handle interactive conversations.\n\nInternally, these assistants complement and even empower employees by automating tasks and providing insights, which frees up time for more strategic work. Externally, they improve customer interactions by quickly understanding and responding to queries through simple conversational prompts.\n\nFor instance, a conversational AI software company, Kore.ai, trained its BankAssist solution for voice, web, mobile, SMS, and social media interactions. This solution enables customers to perform tasks like transferring funds and paying bills. The AI-powered voice assistant boosts performance with personalized suggestions, reducing customer handling time by 40%.\n\nPeople rely on intelligent search every single day, thanks to LLMs trained on internet datasets. These models capture natural languages and the nuances of user queries. Enterprises have tons of proprietary data in private documents and platforms like Snowflake Data Cloud or Oracle Cloud ERP, crucial for business operations. But fully leveraging this data has been practically impossible -- up until now.\n\nGenerative AI allows enterprises to start with a standard LLM, also called a foundation model, which is trained on publicly available data. This training ensures the model understands human languages and acquires a broad set of general knowledge. Once this model is tailored with company data, it can develop tailored applications that interpret business-specific terminology and provide relevant, up-to-date search results for employees and customers. Often, a second LLM is employed for checks and balances, to oversee the first, ensuring that the interactions stay within boundaries and avoid inappropriate content.\n\nTranslating documents and meeting minutes into simple action items has always been a manual, time-consuming process. But with generative AI models, organizations can summarize documents, recordings and videos within seconds.\n\nTake healthcare, for instance. Medical experts can now use generative AI to streamline their review of patient notes to understand patient needs faster and enhance the quality of care. At NYU Langone Health, researchers are developing an LLM trained on a decade of patient records. This isn't limited to summarizing; it's about predicting a patient's risk of readmission within 30 days and other health outcomes.\n\nIn the financial sector, AI models are like high-speed analysts, screening through thousands of data points in real time. This means sharper investment strategies and potentially better returns for investors and portfolio managers.\n\nGenerative AI uses machine learning models like natural language processing (NLP) tools to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language just like we do. Using AI-powered processing tools, businesses can easily access and deploy data by translating, proofreading, automating content creation, extracting and analyzing data, and personalizing documents to individual or audience preferences.\n\nThis is particularly transformative in sectors where large volumes of documents are handled, such as the legal and financial sectors. The integration of generative AI streamlines document processing and enhances data currency and accuracy, fundamentally changing how businesses access, manage and utilize information.\n\nImplementing generative AI to gain a competitive edge can significantly benefit business leaders. This game-changing technology generates new data from existing patterns, enhances productivity, and reduces costs. Key applications include virtual assistants for improved customer interactions, intelligent search for precise data insights, and content summarization for efficient information processing. By tailoring LLMs to their specific needs, businesses can revolutionize operations and drive strategic advancements.\n\nLearn more about why you should adopt generative AI as an indispensable toolset for your organization, whether it's making sense of mountainous data or keeping up with competition.

Working hours in Australia and Japan will be most impacted at 45% and 44% respectively, followed by China (33%).\n\n\u2981 In India, 31% of working hours will either be automated or augmented by generative AI. It could lead to a 0.6 percentage point increase in GDP growth per year and an additional 675 billion (USD) in economic value by 2038.\n\n\u2981 96% of APAC business leaders acknowledge the significant impact of generative AI, and 91% of APAC workers indicate that they are keen to acquire new skills to work with generative AI, but only 4% of business leaders have rolled out generative AI training at scale. Similarly, 89% of APAC businesses are planning to increase their spending on generative AI technology this year, but only 35% are prioritizing investments in their workforce's development.\n\n\u2981 The most impacted industries include Capital markets where generative AI will transform nearly three-quarters of working hours (71%) and Software and Platforms where two-thirds (66%) of working hours will be automated or augmented. This is followed by Banking (64%), Insurance (62%) and Retail (49%).\n\nSaurabh Kumar Sahu, Lead for India Business at Accenture said, \"The scaled and responsible deployment of generative AI can not only drive revenue growth, but also act as a force of change that can reinvent almost all functions across industries. To unlock its real value, businesses need to have a bold vision for reinvention anchored in a strong data and technology foundation. This coupled with an intentional approach to skilling is crucial to succeed in the age of generative AI.\"\n\nTo fully leverage the potential of generative AI, Accenture recommends that businesses take the following steps:\n\n\u2981 Lead and learn in new ways: To be effective and build trust in the generative AI-enabled future, leaders need to engage, lead differently and challenge old mindsets to learn new things. It is important that leaders immerse themselves in the technology, effectively changing how they learn by embedding learning into the flow of work.\n\n\u2981 Reinvent work: By rethinking entire workflows, leaders can gain a clear view of where generative AI can be most impactful, aligning it with business goals for better efficiency and innovation across the enterprise and collapsing silos in a lasting, meaningful way. From there, it's possible to re-focus on how the work needs to change to better serve customers, support people and achieve business outcomes.\n\n\u2981 Reshape the workforce: The shift in how work is done demands a dynamic and adaptable workforce. Organizations need to prioritize continuous talent reinvention. As use of this technology grows, organizations should further leverage tools and technologies, such as skills mapping, that can help facilitate smoother transitions from declining to emerging roles. And as work and roles shift, increased capacity can free up time and talent for higher value activities.\n\n\u2981 Prepare workers: As organisations invest in helping workers acquire market-relevant technical skills and the capability to collaborate with machines, they will also need to focus on soft skills. A teach-to-learn model is emerging to equip workers to teach the machines. Along this journey, leaders also need to listen and involve their people at every step of the way to strengthen trust.\n\nFurther information on the economic modelling\n\nTo estimate the working hours likely to be impacted by gen AI and the associated impact on GDP, Accenture looked at data from four of the five largest economies in APAC - Australia, China, Japan and India:\n\n1. Breakdown jobs into tasks which we then tagged according to potential for automation and augmentation (using machine learning with human verification\n\n2. Used economic literature to estimate the total hours saved based on current state of generative AI\n\n3. Explored likely job transitions (based on historical trends and similarities in skill composition)\n\n4. Built out different scenarios of how organizations could adopt generative AI across three parameters: innovation focus, pace of adoption, and degree of talent displacement.\n\n5.

Here's How", "body": "Wondering what to prioritize in your generative AI strategy? Here are 90+ reasons to focus on tech cost optimization.\n\nBusiness leaders are getting to grips with how generative AI can transform their business -- and it has raised wider questions of how companies can grow through constant change.\n\nOur latest research with 1,500 companies shows that investments in digital core technology can pave the way for businesses to thrive amid change and capture the value of generative AI. The survey revealed that organizations with advanced digital core capabilities, concerted investments in strategic innovation, and a balanced approach achieved 60% higher revenue growth rate and 40% higher profits.\n\nWe have more data to share, in our recent Pulse survey, 85% of organizations said they were confident that they would reach their expected return on investment (ROI) from generative AI by the end of 2024. And 50% said they expected to fully scale generative AI enterprise-wide in six to 12 months.\n\nChief information officers and tech leaders may be wondering which area to prioritize for generative AI: their tech cost optimization programs should be near the top of the list. CIOs are, of course, experts at tech cost optimization: They use it to free cash flow from existing technology spend. They deploy it when investing in new modernization programs, including generative AI, product-value stream models, FinOps and other key investments. And it's a powerful tool for testing the value of new investments.\n\nRelated:Do's and Don'ts of GenAI Spend\n\nWhen these approaches are combined with generative AI, the impact is magnified on your value and efficiency. We are working with clients who are powering self-funded cost-optimization programs. And they are doing this using a shorter, sharper process of discovery, insight generation and automation, thanks to AI.\n\nTo get here, we started with a detailed analysis of the problems facing CIOs, across five core IT functions: data and analytics; technology delivery and operations; product delivery and operations; technology business management; and talent and workforce. This identified more than 180 specific cost-saving levers that CIOs could pull to start getting better value for their business. These are problems that we know nearly all organizations need to solve, and areas of opportunity for them to exploit.\n\nWe then filtered these to identify which were most likely to be solved or mitigated by generative AI. We found that the value potential in more than half could be boosted with generative AI and automation. This gives tech leaders a menu to choose from, so they can focus on the sprints that are likely to deliver early value for their organization and help continuously fund their reinvention.\n\nRelated:Salary Report: IT in Choppy Economic Seas and Roaring Winds of Change\n\nIn data and analytics, we've found the most promising areas are the following: analytics driven by natural language queries; data generation for testing; generating data pipelines; data harmonization; release and test analytics; and generative AI-assisted data models.\n\nIn tech delivery and operations, many CIOs are focusing on these: generating automated workflows and test scripts; real-time root-cause analysis; and identifying automation opportunities.\n\nIn product delivery, among other services, we are helping clients use generative AI for these situations: code development; generating and analyzing user stories; generating test cases and scripts to accelerate automated testing; incident prevention; and for testing and accelerating configurations.\n\nIn technology business management, generative AI is proving particularly valuable for improving automated service desks, chatbots and incident resolution.\n\nTo take one example, we helped a European energy company to unlock productivity gains in project delivery and data management using generative AI. This collaboration could halve the time it takes to produce oil on a new site and improve productivity by 5% annually.\n\nRelated:Special Report: What's Next for the GenAI Market in 2024?\n\nAnd we worked with a leading beverage company to streamline its applications management processes. This helped the company to cut its incident resolution turnaround time from an average of two days to under five minutes.\n\nOur digital core research cites AI as a top contributor to technical debt -- the cost and effort required to keep IT systems up to date, accumulated through choices that prioritize speed over long-term maintainability. It also reveals that leading companies allocate, on average, 15% of their IT budget toward tech debt remediation. This allows them to \"pay down the debt\" without sacrificing strategic investments. At the same time, these companies are shifting at least 6% of their IT budget annually from maintenance to innovation, including generative AI.\n\nOf course, this represents a shift in thinking. It means moving from mobilizing long-term programs of tech transformation to an era of continuous reinvention. It will clearly benefit CIOs who are overseeing multiple, agile teams working on specific problems that are hyper-focused on their customer base and geared toward helping the organization respond innovatively to their customers' challenges.\n\nOne of the key benefits is versatility. A lot of the savings we've mapped are being delivered within months. Each tech investment is directly linked to clear business outcomes. And it's making the most of generative AI's ability to drive return on investment, through revenue uplift, productivity increases and a reduction in capital expenditure.", "source": {"uri": "informationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InformationWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/blt69a3c5d56a3507cb/66aa78d740b1f410e14ec992/electrify-Zoonar_GmbH_-alamy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

They noted that the country's youthful population is a significant asset for promoting economic development, particularly in AI.\n\n\"This demographic trend underscores the critical role that Nigeria's youth will play in the global economy, especially in providing a digitally enabled workforce for the global AI ecosystem requirements. Furthermore, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (46) forecasts that by 2030, 28 million jobs in Nigeria will demand digital skills, highlighting a market valued at $130 billion,\" they added.\n\nHowever, the strategy document acknowledges that Nigeria faces significant challenges in realising the full potential of its youth demographic due to high levels of poverty, unemployment, and insecurity.\n\nThe document noted that what makes AI a compelling force for advancement and change is that the technology has the potential to make an impact for all, irrespective of a nation's developmental cycle.\n\nIt stressed that it can provide a veritable alternative to address less developed countries' human resource and infrastructure gaps as it can be adapted to serve nuanced development-oriented use cases.\n\nAccordingly, it pointed out that attaining significant results such as these, where AI bridges developmental gaps, requires a strategic approach that includes accelerating development and solidifying governmental commitment to a shared vision, long-term orientation, responsible governance frameworks, and values that build trust and cohesion.\n\nThe document said the upside is the potential for game-changing improvements in core areas that underscore a country's health and longevity.\n\nIt said while there are concerns, among others, that the developing world could be left behind as AI advances rapidly, it is an emerging knowledge that if AI is deployed effectively and harnessed responsibly, it promises to drive inclusive and sustainable growth-reducing poverty and inequality, advancing environmental sustainability, improving lives, and empowering individuals in all societies across all stages of development.\n\n\"AI is, therefore, a developmental equaliser at a scale similar to the Internet. It will also be the great differentiator and the nations that become the leaders in its application will rule the emerging world. In an increasingly AI-driven world, countries with a compelling national AI strategy will soar above others, leading to a perhaps impenetrable hierarchy that will benefit some while leaving others behind.\n\n\"This is the AI reality and imperative that each nation faces today, as validated by its potential contribution to global and local economies.\"", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Change management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Finance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tech-Startups-2-640x360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Here's how organizations can harness AI's potential by focusing on data management and building diverse, adaptable teams.\n\nScience-fiction novelist Neal Stephenson said, \"See, the world is full of things more powerful than us. But if you know how to catch a ride, you can go places.\"\n\nGrowing up reading the works of Stephenson, I never could've imagined the level of innovation we're witnessing today. I'm talking, of course, about artificial intelligence. It's certainly taking us places, and it will soon be a part of nearly every aspect of our daily lives.\n\nWe're living in the age of the intelligent systems economy, in which AI and data-powered intelligent devices and systems -- from robots to business automation processes -- have become key economic drivers. Every industry is being revolutionized by AI and data, and organizations need to learn how to \"catch a ride.\"\n\nThe companies that build and leverage this technology also have an inherent responsibility to ensure that it is used for social and economic good. The potential is massive: PwC global projects AI could contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined.\n\nIt'll also be critical to ensure that AI-powered technology is accessible so that it can benefit as many individuals as possible. AI is already helping people by accelerating the development of life-saving treatments in healthcare and acting as a great equalizer in education, empowering students with more information than ever before. The possibilities of what else it could do to improve lives in just a few short years are limitless.\n\nRelated:Why Your Business Should Consider Using Intelligent Applications\n\nOrganizations must move quickly if they want to succeed and make meaningful contributions in the intelligent systems economy. There are two critical aspects to making that happen: data and people.\n\nAI would not exist if not for big data. To fuel AI initiatives, companies need accurate and reliable data to avoid pitfalls like AI hallucinations, and they also must have the ability to understand their data so that it can be leveraged to its full potential. But companies oftentimes don't know where to start on their intelligent systems journey. Factors like cost, added complexity, fragmented workloads, and privacy (especially when it comes to generative AI) further add to this uncertainty. In order to understand their data and address the aforementioned concerns, organizations need to adopt supportive technology.\n\nFirst and foremost, modern organizations need solutions that do more than just store their data; they need the ability to cleanse and curate their data - fast -- so that it's readily consumable for intelligent applications. Essentially, they need tools that let them inject intelligence directly into their data stack. Observability is also crucial: AI has an insatiable appetite for data from a plethora of sources, and businesses need visibility into this process across their various data estates.\n\nRelated:Salary Report: IT in Choppy Economic Seas and Roaring Winds of Change\n\nAdditionally, data gravity has created the need for compute to occur as close to the originating data source as possible. Take autonomous vehicles (AVs), for example. An AV is constantly generating data from its cameras, speedometer, GPS, and various sensors. For the AV to react to its environment in real time, the compute must take place within the vehicle itself -- there's no time for data to roundtrip to the cloud when it comes to split-second decisions, like slowing down to avoid an impending collision.\n\nCompanies need solutions that are flexible enough to run both in the cloud or on-premises depending on their specific needs and workloads. AI is still a new frontier, so companies should opt for technologies with an extensible underlying data model that also provide ongoing support as they navigate building these novel intelligent applications.\n\nRelated:10 Hottest AI Jobs\n\nAn organization can have all the right data, robust technology to support it, and a strategy for the intelligent systems economy. But without the right people, achieving its vision won't be possible.\n\nAI is impacting data management roles across organizations -- all the way from the chief data officer (CDO) to data analysts. While AI won't replace many data-related roles, it will empower data professionals to do more, especially those who are eager to acquire new AI-related skill sets. This is one reason why it's important to hire people with a growth mindset: As AI proliferates, organizations will benefit from bringing on individuals who are willing to learn and curious about the new opportunities AI presents.\n\nIt's imperative to build diverse teams in order to effectively drive AI initiatives. Diverse teams are well-equipped to problem-solve, innovate, and think creatively when it comes to leveraging AI. A diverse talent base also helps companies understand and connect with customers on a deeper level. Organizations need to stay accountable and walk the talk when it comes to diversity by regularly measuring it within the organization and setting diversity-related hiring goals for leadership. It's just like any other business goal -- metrics and results matter.\n\nQuoting Stephenson again, \"Interesting things happen along borders -- transitions -- not in the middle where everything is the same.\" We're transitioning into a world in which AI touches everything. No one knows how this will look in five or 10 years, but if it's anything like the innovation we've seen so far, we can bet it will be interesting. Every company is striving to succeed in the intelligent systems economy, and the ones that will are those who get two things right: data and people.", "source": {"uri": "informationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InformationWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neal Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PwC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PwC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Observability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Czech_Darts_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 Czech Darts Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/blt3d1cd3c37e728bea/66b271abcab83b6ae13c6765/teamwork-ronstik-alamy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Most students want to incorporate AI into their education, yet also perceive the dangers of becoming over-reliant on AI,\" the report says.\n\nDespite this, significant numbers of students admitted to using such technology. Some 86 percent said they \"regularly\" used programs such as ChatGPT in their studies, 54 percent said they used it on a weekly basis, and 24 percent said they used it to write a first draft of a submission.\n\nHowever, Danny Bielik, president of the Digital Education Council, said he expected this figure to be higher, and he believes many students are too nervous to admit using AI in their essays because of stigmatization and uncertainty over whether AI is permitted at their university.\n\nThe survey found 86 percent of students said they were not fully aware of the AI guidelines at their university, and Bielik said students often receive \"conflicting information,\" highlighting the need for greater communication between students, staff and wider university ecosystems.\n\n\"Often communication happens at the faculty level. So, students might be in one class being told one thing about what they are and aren't allowed to use generative AI for, and then they go into another class and they're told something completely different,\" Bielik said.\n\nThe report comes as universities are stepping up their efforts to detect AI in student essays as AI drafting becomes increasingly prevalent, with Turnitin claiming 11 percent of 200 million submissions it received featured \"at least\" 20 percent AI-drafted content, and a recent study found undetected ChatGPT-generated exam answers scored more highly than real students.\n\nRespondents said they felt they lacked sufficient AI knowledge and skills (reported by 58 percent of students), and the report adds that they increasingly expect training to be incorporated into their studies. Consequently, training staff members on AI is a \"baseline expectation\" before integrating it into courses.\n\n\"The application and use of AI in education is becoming the new standard, and universities will need to take steps to ensure that they have appropriate measures and preparations in place to guide AI integration in their organizations,\" the report says.\n\n\"Students are as conflicted as the rest of us,\" Bielik said. \"Communication is more than just writing policies and publishing them on your website.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidehighered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krystian_Bielik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krystian Bielik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnitin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnitin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2024-08/ai_robot.jpg?itok=8lMmk2f7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

This is one of many initiatives the organization has leveraged to keep its curriculum cutting-edge since its inception in 2006.\n\nWe spoke to founder Tara Chklovski, Ph.D., about Technovation's mission, its AI initiatives, and how businesses can support young women in their careers. Bringing more women and girls into the AI industry brings the courage needed to solve problems like bias, she said.\n\nTechnovation is an educational nonprofit that operates around the world. Girls and young women ages 8 to 18 can join the program to create a project that benefits their local communities using technology. The project takes about 12 weeks.\n\nEach girl or team of girls is paired with a mentor -- for younger girls, a parent -- who helps them identify problems and find technological solutions. One group from a rural area in Kenya trained AI to recognize gunshot sounds in order to speed up responses to crime from law enforcement. Other groups created apps to assist women in reporting domestic violence or an app connected to a vibrating bracelet that alerts deaf or hard-of-hearing people to fire, weather, or other alarms.\n\n\"We are the only program that is global, fully focused on girls, and has long-term data to show that because of the deep technology experience they go into higher degrees in computer science and into the tech careers at a much higher rate than normal,\" said Chklovski.\n\nShe said 76% of Technovation graduates go into computer science degrees, and 60% go into tech careers, specifically because of their participation in the program. Chklovski attributes this success in part to putting problem-solving first.\n\n\"Instead of walking you through the fundamentals of programming and, at the end, you have a project, we flipped it to say, how do you identify meaningful problems that are going to change the world?\" she said.\n\nParticipants emerge from their project with a robust business plan and pitch, as well as demo videos for their product.\n\nEncouraging girls to get into forward-looking tech enriches the industry with people confident enough to introduce new ideas, Chklovski said.\n\n\"You just want a workforce that's courageous, that can come up with new ideas,\" she said. \"The heart of innovation is new ideas, different ideas, different ways of thinking.\"\n\nThe AI Forward Alliance is a collaboration between Technovation, UNICEF, Google, and other organizations with the goal of impacting 25 million young women. Specifically, the alliance seeks to foster problem-solving skills, complex systems thinking, data science, and machine learning.\n\nChklovski pointed out that AI isn't Technovation's sole focus, but it has been a part of its efforts for several years.\n\n\"We started doing an AI-in-action kind of curriculum eight years ago,\" said Chklovski. \"We are coming to this AI conversation with ... tons of data on what works, what doesn't work. The whole [generative] AI boom is only accelerating. What we have seen is exciting and interesting to young girls.\n\n\"The AI Forward Alliance really is about bringing cutting-edge technology. At the moment, it's AI, but maybe in five to 10 years, maybe it's quantum computing. So, we are in some sense tech-agnostic. It's more about what's relevant to workforce training, what's the most powerful tool to tackle the big, complex problems we face.\"\n\nChklovski acknowledges that generative AI can cause, as The AI Forward Alliance stated, \"contention and concern\" -- particularly when it comes to AI hallucinations, which occur when an AI model generates inaccurate or misleading information but presents it as if it were true.\n\n\"There's so much room for improvement,\" Chklovski said in response to concerns about AI hallucinations. \"And I think the way to do that is to improve the data set.\"\n\nFor example, Technovation projects need to have data on local issues to solve local problems.\n\n\"We work with orphanages across Vietnam, and the girls are very concerned that the standard image recognition models that are accessible do not recognize Vietnamese facial expressions,\" said Chklovski. \"And so they developed their own data set and trained it so that it could work for their population.\"\n\nSEE: Stay up-to-date on artificial intelligence with TechRepublic's cheat sheet.\n\nDespite years of progress in various sectors, the tech industry continues to grapple with a longstanding issue: the persistent underrepresentation of women.\n\nRecent research shows that women hold about 26% of tech-related jobs in the U.S., despite women comprising nearly half of the labor force. Women make up 35% of all employees in computer system design and related services in the U.S.\n\nImproving gender equity in the workplace reduces the chance that products, including generative AI, will show bias. A 2018 study from Deloitte found that when organizational leaders foster inclusion, 70% of workers report an increase in \"respect, value, and longing,\" as well as \"psychological safety; and inspiration.\"\n\nConversely, having fewer women in tech limits the pool of people who can help businesses find solutions to real problems. For example, projects worked on in Technovation groups often align with the UN General Assembly's global goals.\n\nTo encourage young women to pursue or continue tech careers, businesses should look outside traditional college pipelines for the skills they want to hire, Chklovski said. Many conversations about AI in education are \"myopic,\" she suggested, because the technology moves too quickly.\n\n\"Prompt engineering is something else. People talk about it, and I think that that's aiming too low,\" she said. \"Because by the time you develop the curriculum, you train the teachers, you deploy this at large scale, the technology has already changed. It's more important to teach young people, especially, to build future-proof skills where lifelong learning is the key.\"\n\nRecruiters should search for products young women like the graduates of Technovation have already built and the problems they have solved. For example, Chklovski said, a Technovation team created an Uber-like app in 2010, before the proliferation of rideshare companies. Another group created an app that encouraged digital \"focus time,\" long before it was a common mantra that people might struggle with attentiveness in a flood of digital information.\n\nShe suggested businesses bring a project-first, hands-on approach to workplace training, encouraging people to pick a problem and learn to solve it rather than watching \"extremely boring\" training courses.\n\nBusinesses should also consider internships for young women who hold computer science degrees or have hand-on experience from beyond the top 20 universities, Chklovski noted.\n\n\"We have 11,000 alumna who are above the age of 18 -- looking for internships, early career opportunities -- and have a robust portfolio to show what they have built, what kinds of problems they have solved,\" she said. \"It takes away some of the uncertainties from hiring.\"", "source": {"uri": "techrepublic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRepublic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_crouse@techrepublic.com", "name": "Megan Crouse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender pay gap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantum computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Complex system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2024/08/tr_20240808-technovation-global-nonprofit-girls-tech-ai.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

With the proliferation of AI, we have seen significant improvements in efficiency in handling tasks and, for various market segments, an improvement in the professional quality of products and services. However, in the data-driven world we live in today, the use of AI by corporations has only intensified the ever-growing concerns regarding privacy and data protection.\n\nConsidering this new reality, it is important and interesting to note the measures being recently taken by data protection authorities in Korea and Brazil to regulate the AI systems used by big data corporations, as these measures serve as examples to follow on the otherwise unregulated advancement of AI technologies.\n\nKorea's Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) recently made headlines by imposing a $1.4 million fine on AliExpress for privacy and data protection breaches. The PIPC uncovered that AliExpress had transferred Korean customers' data to foreign sellers without proper consent, as required by Korean privacy laws regarding international data transfer. Furthermore, the PIPC is also scrutinizing another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, for similar privacy concerns. The PIPC's actions send a clear message that, regardless of its origin, companies that treat personal data must comply with the nation's stringent data protection regulations.\n\nJoel Cho\n\nOn the other side of the globe, Brazil's National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) has recently taken significant steps against Big Tech players like Meta and X, formerly Twitter, relating to the improper use of users' personal data to train their respective proprietary AI tools. The ANPD suspended Meta's new privacy policy, which basically allowed the company to use users' public posts to train its AI models. This decision was driven by concerns over the potential risks to users' privacy, especially minors, and Meta's failure to adequately inform users about these changes and their right to opt out, which are all requirements by the Brazilian data protection law. Meta's situation in Brazil is not isolated, as the ANPD has also begun investigating X for similar reasons. The ANPD has initiated an investigation against X, due to the collection and treatment of its user data to also train its new AI, known as Grok, without properly notifying its users. The ANPD sent an official notice to the company requesting clarifications after finding out that the new data collection option for AI training was quietly added to the platform's settings without providing clear information or instructions on how users could opt out of this form of treatment. This conduct constitutes a violation of Brazilian data protection law, particularly concerning the lack of transparency and information and the users' right to decide and oppose the collection and treatment of their personal data.\n\nSo how does all of this recent news regarding measures taken by Korean and Brazilian data authorities relate to AI?\n\nWe believe that the actions taken by both the PIPC and the ANPD weave a common thread of leveraging existing data protection laws to regulate the use of AI by big data companies. This approach, whether intentional or not, is particularly significant in the current landscape we stand in regarding AI technology, where comprehensive AI-specific regulations are still embryotic and lacking.\n\nData protection laws in both Korea and Brazil require companies to adopt measures to guarantee that the data subjects are informed and are given control over their personal data, especially ensuring transparency about data usage and mechanisms for users to exercise their rights over their data. By enforcing these requirements, data protection authorities can effectively prevent the misuse of personal data for AI training purposes, which could lead to unprecedented consequences.\n\nThe implications of these regulatory strategies may extend beyond the borders of Korea and Brazil, as they can be replicated in other countries grappling with similar challenges with the rampant growth of AI. As AI technology evolves and its applications become more pervasive, it is crucial to have robust safeguards in place to protect individuals' privacy and data rights.\n\nMoreover, these actions of the PIPC and the ANPD demonstrate that data protection authorities can play a pivotal role in the broader governance of AI. They can ensure that the development and exploitation of AI technologies are conducted following ethical and responsible guidelines, by holding companies accountable for their data practices.\n\nWhile the use of data protection laws to regulate AI seems to be a good interim measure for the reality we live in today, it should not be a substitute for comprehensive AI-specific regulations, since AI technologies are not only limited to data protection issues. So, the current data protection laws are insufficient to address all the different issues and concerns that AI technology poses.\n\nAs we move forward, it is crucial that more robust regulatory frameworks that safeguard individuals' rights and promote ethical AI development be issued.\n\nThe lessons from Korea and Brazil serve as a powerful reminder that data protection is not just about privacy, it is about protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in an increasingly digital world.\n\nChyung Eun-ju (ejchyung@snu.ac.kr) is a marketing analyst at Career Step.

Warren Buffett did not invest in technology for a long time as he did not understand it. Yet he did just fine using the power of compounding. If you also are new to the technology industry but want to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, where can you begin?\n\nAI is one of the most complex pieces of technology. But you don't need to understand the algorithms to invest in technology. You need to see how AI can help a business make money. If you cannot see the opportunity, it is better not to invest. Why do I say so?\n\nOnly when you understand the business and the opportunity can you stay invested in the stock during difficult times. In August, the Nasdaq saw a sell-off after Amazon posted disappointing earnings despite a significant investment in AI. Even Microsoft's share price fell on weak cloud revenue, although the company said that the revenue will pick up in the first half of 2025. Such short-term weakness does not affect the secular growth potential of AI.\n\nAs a new investor in the tech space, you can start with some obvious AI stocks for which the results of AI are visible. You can get exposure to the broader trend through an AI-themed ETF. In the meantime, reading about AI and its investing opportunities can build your understanding of the tech.\n\nAI works at multiple levels. It has a supply chain of hardware, software, infrastructure, and end applications. Many companies are building AI capabilities, bringing revenue to hardware suppliers like Nvidia and Broadcom. The two companies reported strong growth in AI-chips revenue. Since they are leaders in their respective chips, you can invest with the logic that they are selling shovels in the gold rush.\n\nThey can give you immediate short-term growth from the growing capital spending by companies in AI capabilities. If they lose their moat of being the most advanced AI chip providers, you could consider booking profits. Individual stocks carry high business risk.\n\nUnlike other sectors, the tech sector is more volatile. A new company can put an industry leader out of business with disruptive technology. Apple disrupted the button phone market leader BlackBerry in 2008 with its touch phone. Advanced Micro Devices overtook its rival Intel (more than 10 times its size) with its advanced 10-nanometer processors. Today it is at 3 nanometer chips.\n\nTo reduce this risk of disruptive technological trends, consider diversifying your AI investment into ETFs.\n\nThe Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) invests in stocks of companies that provide hardware or are using artificial intelligence to enhance their products and services. The ETF has holdings in 84 AI stocks selected by fund managers. By buying a unit of the ETF, you get a share in the ETF's AI portfolio. You benefit from the change in the overall portfolio value as the price of underlying stocks changes. The ETF charges 0.68% of the portfolio value as an expense ratio to cover its brokerage and fund manager costs.\n\nThe AIQ ETF has holdings in companies like Netflix, Adobe, and Salesforce, which use artificial intelligence to improve their service offerings and stay relevant to the changing technological trends.\n\nAI is a new technology with several grey areas, which brings risk and volatility. Despite the risk, new technologies develop and drive down costs. We have examples of electric vehicles and renewable energy that saw widespread adoption after many trials and failures.

While some fiction writers, such as Sheila Heti and Ken Liu, have started to adopt LLMs as writing tools, many others voice doubts about the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into their writing process; they acknowledge biases in datasets, a lack of consent involved in obtaining data, environmental harms, and exploitative labor practices. The concerns of artists are not so different from the concerns among humanists whose attitudes toward generative AI have largely been critical. Indeed, \"Critical AI\" names the dominant humanities-based approach to studying AI and its applications. It foregrounds political economy, ideology critique, social biases, and rightly deflates the hype emanating from leading AI companies.\n\nOur special issue on \"Cultural AI,\" while indebted to this work, names and demonstrates an alternative approach to humanistic engagement with artificial intelligence. To borrow a phrase from Dipesh Chakrabarty, we believe that critique is both \"indispensable and inadequate\" to understanding the impact of generative AI on the objects, methods, institutions and pedagogy of the humanities. Computational expressive cultures precede our current iteration of transformer-based AI systems, but they will no doubt grow exponentially in the years to come with the development and adoption of LLMs and multimodal models across various and many industries. We need to understand AI as a cultural technology that is here to stay. This includes analyzing contemporary AI's relationship to earlier historical versions of automatic text generation, such as Theo Lutz's Stochastic Texts for example, as well as how LLMs are enabling aesthetic innovation and asking novel conceptual questions about the uniqueness of human beings, the nature of interiority, and the meaning of craft.\n\nOverall, this special issue on \"Cultural AI\" regards the task before humanists as three-fold: to analyze the impact of generative AI on the writing, reading, and philosophy of fiction; to understand how we might use this technology to study fiction; and to shape the broader public and intellectual discourse over the proper role of AI in everyday life specifically as it pertains to domains of art, writing, and culture.\n\nWe seek to assemble a special issue on AI and culture that combines critical approaches with affordance-based ones. We welcome papers that take LLM and generative AI models as objects of cultural study, as well as those that use these models to analyze literary fiction and fiction-adjacent activities such as virtual reality, videogames, online culture, and chatbot creation. We also welcome methodological papers that illustrate and/or reflect on the affordances and challenges of using generative AI models to study and teach literature. We are thus very interested in papers that are at once critical and applied.\n\nPotential topics include:\n\n1) Fictionality: The \"rise of fictionality\" remains a much-discussed topic in literary studies especially among scholars of the earlier periods of literary history. What is the \"rise of Generative AI\" doing to contemporary understandings of fictionality? In turn, can literary, philosophical, or transmedial conceptions of fictionality help make sense of the outputs of language models and multimodal models?\n\n2) How do generative AI and large language models potentially encode new theoretical problems and frameworks for literary studies, and how do such frameworks help to revivify long-standing theories in the discipline, such as structuralism, deconstruction, new historicism, etc?\n\n3) Keywords or major concepts from Literary Theory or Cultural Studies that have explanatory or theoretical power over developments and implementations in Generative AI; how can literary and cultural theory potentially help us rethink or reform the creation and use of common AI models?\n\n4) Data-driven and computational approaches that adopt LLMs for literary and/or cultural study.\n\n5) Co-intelligence: Does co-intelligence give us new purchase on critical concepts essential to the study of modern fiction, such as originality, authorial intention, and individuality? Is co-intelligence a form of skilling or deskilling for the literary arts and how might it shape new styles, forms, and publishing environments for contemporary fiction?\n\n6) Decolonized, indigenous, or global South approaches, both critical and practice-based, to generative AI and data sovereignty.\n\n7) Confabulation and Hallucination: Models frequently make things up and people use models to deceive others. Are humanists in a particularly good position to theorize the nature of confabulated model outputs as well as the uses/abuses to which models might be put?\n\nIf you are interested in contributing an article to this special issue, please submit a 500-word proposal/abstract by November 30, 2024 by email to richard.so@mcgill.ca with \"MFS SPECIAL ISSUE\" in the email title.

The software is expected to eventually be as ubiquitous within the bank as the videoconferencing program Zoom, people with knowledge of the plans told CNBC.\n\nRather than developing its own AI models, JPMorgan designed LLM Suite to be a portal that allows users to tap external large language models -- the complex programs underpinning generative AI tools -- and launched it with ChatGPT maker OpenAI's LLM, said the people.\n\n\"Ultimately, we'd like to be able to move pretty fluidly across models depending on the use cases,\" Teresa Heitsenrether, JPMorgan's chief data and analytics officer, said in an interview. \"The plan is not to be beholden to any one model provider.\"\n\nThe move by JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, shows how quickly generative AI has swept through American corporations since the arrival of ChatGPT in late 2022. Rival bank Morgan Stanley has already released a pair of OpenAI-powered tools for its financial advisors. And consumer tech giant Apple said in June that it was integrating OpenAI models into the operating system of hundreds of millions of its consumer devices, vastly expanding its reach.\n\nThe technology -- hailed by some as the \"Cognitive Revolution\" in which tasks formerly done by knowledge workers will be automated -- could be as important as the advent of electricity, the printing press and the internet, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in April.\n\nIt will likely \"augment virtually every job\" at the bank, Dimon said. JPMorgan had about 313,000 employees as of June.\n\nThe bank is giving employees what is essentially OpenAI's ChatGPT in a JPMorgan-approved wrapper more than a year after it restricted employees from using ChatGPT. That's because JPMorgan didn't want to expose its data to external providers, Heitsenrether said.\n\n\"Since our data is a key differentiator, we don't want it being used to train the model,\" she said. \"We've implemented it in a way that we can leverage the model while still keeping our data protected.\"\n\nThe bank has introduced LLM Suite broadly across the company, with groups using it in JPMorgan's consumer division, investment bank, and asset and wealth management business, the people said. It can help employees with writing, summarizing lengthy documents, problem solving using Excel, and generating ideas.\n\nBut getting it on employees' desktops is just the first step, according to Heitsenrether, who was promoted in 2023 to lead the bank's adoption of the red-hot technology.\n\n\"You have to teach people how to do prompt engineering that is relevant for their domain to show them what it can actually do,\" Heitsenrether said. \"The more people get deep into it and unlock what it's good at and what it's not, the more we're starting to see the ideas really flourishing.\"\n\nThe bank's engineers can also use LLM Suite to incorporate functions from external AI models directly into their programs, she said.\n\nJPMorgan has been working on traditional AI and machine learning for more than a decade, but the arrival of ChatGPT forced it to pivot.\n\nTraditional, or narrow, AI performs specific tasks involving pattern recognition, like making predictions based on historical data. Generative AI is more advanced, however, and trains models on vast data sets with the goal of pattern creation, which is how human-sounding text or realistic images are formed.\n\nThe number of uses for generative AI are \"exponentially bigger\" than previous technology because of how flexible LLMs are, Heitsenrether said.\n\nThe bank is testing many cases for both forms of AI and has already put a few into production.\n\nJPMorgan is using generative AI to create marketing content for social media channels, map out itineraries for clients of the travel agency it acquired in 2022 and summarize meetings for financial advisors, she said.\n\nThe consumer bank uses AI to determine where to place new branches and ATMs by ingesting satellite images and in call centers to help service personnel quickly find answers, Heitsenrether said.\n\nIn the firm's global-payments business, which moves more than $8 trillion around the world daily, AI helps prevent hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud, she said.\n\nBut the bank is being more cautious with generative AI that directly touches upon the individual customer because of the risk that a chatbot gives bad information, Heitsenrether said.\n\nUltimately, the generative AI field may develop into \"five or six big foundational models\" that dominate the market, she said.\n\nThe bank is testing LLMs from U.S. tech giants as well as open source models to onboard to its portal next, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about the bank's AI strategy.\n\nHeitsenrether charted out three stages for the evolution of generative AI at JPMorgan.\n\nThe first is simply making the models available to workers; the second involves adding proprietary JPMorgan data to help boost employee productivity, which is the stage that has just begun at the company.\n\nThe third is a larger leap that would unlock far greater productivity gains, which is when generative AI is powerful enough to operate as autonomous agents that perform complex multistep tasks. That would make rank-and-file employees more like managers with AI assistants at their command.\n\nThe technology will likely empower some workers while displacing others, changing the composition of the industry in ways that are hard to predict.\n\nBanking jobs are the most prone to automation of all industries, including technology, health care and retail, according to consulting firm Accenture. AI could boost the sector's profits by $170 billion in just four years, Citigroup analysts said.\n\nPeople should consider generative AI \"like an assistant that takes away the more mundane things that we would all like to not do, where it can just give you the answer without grinding through the spreadsheets,\" Heitsenrether said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prompt engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Printing press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/08/108017586-1723050002058-TH_Offsite_Photo.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

A total of 86% that implemented generative AI saw their revenue increase by more than 6%. More than three quarters (77%) saw their leads and customer acquisition improve. Nearly half (45%) saw employee productivity at least double. More than half (56%) reported improved cybersecurity, with 82% better able to identify threats, and 71% able to resolve issues faster. And 85% said user engagement has increased with generative AI.\n\n\"Generative AI is not just a technological innovation; it's a strategic differentiator,\" Oliver Parker, vice president of global generative AI go-to-market, Google Cloud, said in the study. \"Organizations investing in gen AI today are the ones that will be best positioned to succeed in the coming decade.\"\n\nJust under half of respondents said their financial gains will be reinvested into AI, creating better solutions for more aspects of their companies. A total of 47% are investing in business and technology alignment to support change management for AI adoption. Almost the same amount said they plan to invest in upskilling their workforce and attracting new talent better versed in AI. And 43% are investing in data quality and knowledge management to ensure future generative AI systems have accurate and reliable data to work on.\n\nMost companies, Google found, were able to get moving on generative AI quickly. A total of 84% said they moved from pilot to production in six months or less. And most of the 39% of organizations that don't have AI systems up and running are working on it. Only 5% haven't yet started.\n\nThis study provides tangible evidence of how investments in AI -- both in terms of time and money -- can really pay off. I talked more with Parker about how companies are making generative AI succeed, both through strategic alignment and smart applications. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter, and a longer transcript is available here.\n\nGoogle violated antitrust laws in order to maintain a monopoly for its search engine, a federal judge ruled this week. The U.S. Justice Department and 11 states sued the company, saying it illegally built its dominance by paying billions of dollars to companies including Apple and Samsung to feature Google as the default search engine on their devices.\n\nThe tech giant currently handles about 90% of all internet searches, and its name is officially a verb: \"Googling.\" The judge ruled that Google's exclusive distribution agreements on devices have anticompetitive effects, allowing the company to earn monopoly-level profits.\n\nThe 286-page ruling doesn't go into remedies, which will be decided later -- though the Washington Post has already listed some possibilities. Google has vowed to appeal the ruling, while federal government officials have praised it for opening the door to more competition for consumers.\n\nMany see this as the most significant tech antitrust decision since the 1999 ruling against Microsoft which said the tech giant had illegally used the dominance of its Windows operating system to block competitor web browsers. At the time, a federal judge ruled that Microsoft needed to be split up -- a demand that was reversed on appeal, though Microsoft was prohibited from mandating restrictive contracts on industry partners, opening the door for other popular web browsers and applications. Ironically, some analysts say that if it holds, the decision against Google creates a big opportunity for Microsoft's Bing search engine.\n\nA month after a bad CrowdStrike update crippled thousands of enterprise computers running on Windows -- which led to chaos for businesses including banks, airlines and health care -- the cybersecurity company released a detailed root cause analysis. The problem, writes Forbes senior contributor Katie O'Flaherty, was caused by a glitch in a feature added in February to enhance visibility on Windows attacks. When last month's update -- pushed out to millions of users at once -- was installed, a sensor in the new feature got more responses than it was programmed for, taking down systems.\n\nWhile programming issues happen and glitches are commonplace, CrowdStrike admitted it should have found this error though internal testing first. CrowdStrike is changing its system, adding layers of internal testing before deploying updates, and hiring two independent third-party software security experts to examine the code and provide suggestions. CrowdStrike is also giving users more say in when and how they get updates. Users will get to choose when the updates are added, so it's more convenient -- and updates can be skipped if it appears they are causing problems with other computer systems.\n\nThe $3 billion annual revenue company has many more problems to deal with from the outage. Last week, a group of investors filed a class action lawsuit against the company, arguing they were misled by the company's assurances that its solutions were \"validated, tested and certified,\" O'Flaherty wrote. Delta, which ended up canceling 5,500 flights because the CrowdStrike issue took down its systems, has threatened to sue the company. CrowdStrike maintains Delta refused its offers of help during the outage, and cannot be blamed for the airline's IT choices, which may have made it take longer to get the system back.\n\nThis week, Elon Musk revived a lawsuit against OpenAI that he had dismissed in June. Musk, an initial cofounder of OpenAI who left in 2018, accused the company, cofounder and CEO Sam Altman, and cofounder and President Greg Brockman of changing its mission. Instead of continuing as a company dedicated to AI for the benefit of humanity, the lawsuit says it has become dedicated to maximizing profit. Musk dropped the initial lawsuit without explanation the day before an expected judge's ruling on whether it should be dismissed. Musk, who now has his own AI company xAI, does not appear to have posted about the revived lawsuit on X. In reaction, OpenAI pointed to a blog post it wrote about Musk's accusations when he first sued the company in March.\n\nNearly three-quarters of early generative AI adopters are seeing a return on investment, according to a study Google Cloud published today and first shared with Forbes. How are these early adopters so successful? I talked to Oliver Parker, vice president for Global Generative AI Go-To-Market for Google Cloud, about working with executives on AI adoption. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. A more complete version is available here.\n\nWhat is the most important takeaway from the study?\n\nParker: It's the continued theme of C-suite sponsorship and commitment. You can say the same thing nine different ways, but the net is senior sponsorship and engagement in the use of this technology is incredibly apparent. Where you see success, that is one of the key ingredients.\n\nThe second one is defining the use cases that will have the biggest impact -- at least as an organization gets going -- and the ones with solid ROI. What are the key metrics you're using to measure opportunity? Is this for cost savings or around new revenue growth? Really defining the business case that actually supports the implementation of the use case.\n\nThe study showed 74% of enterprises using generative AI were receiving ROI already -- and 86% were seeing revenue growth of 6% or more. Do you see that changing in 12 months?\n\nFor people who are putting these systems into production, that feels like the right kind of curve. What would happen going forward is that the volume of people doing it would be exponentially larger. I'd assert going forward that [those who already had] their first or second use case will see way more from their third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth to ninth.\n\nAre you just having fun with this thing, or are you getting serious? I think there's a phase in the middle. You've got experimentation, you've got production, and then you've got scale production: Rather than having one or two use cases that are really delivering value, you've got hundreds of use cases. I think this is what you'll start to see. If we interviewed all those 2,500 leaders a year from now, it would be fascinating to see the explosion of use cases in production.\n\nWhat wisdom would you share with a company that doesn't have any AI applications in production but is working toward getting them in the future?\n\nYou have to do the due diligence on the way you think it can make a difference to your organization. Just firing up something to help you with emails could be helpful, but that may not be enough to show a true ROI. With our clients, we go look at their quarterly earnings. What are the priorities of the client? Then we'll sit down and work with them.\n\nHaving senior leadership is absolutely instrumental. Lining it up to the business imperatives of the company is super important, because then when you sit down with the CFO and ask for investments in these new capabilities, you're lining up to a strategic imperative of the company.\n\nHaving the tech skills and the talent in-house is really important. Where I've seen companies do very well, they have some technical capability within their engineering or IT org.\n\nAnd then finally, where it starts at the top, you have to infuse a culture of experimentation. You're building a set of muscles and capabilities where people feel that they can experiment and be creative. Some people will fail, but that's the whole point. You have to go through this failure process to succeed at the same time.\n\nWhich world leader endorsed expanding law enforcement's use of live facial recognition technology this week?", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b4ecf444c9674978f95d78/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3180,1788,x0,y301,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

He follows Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's investment advice and has completed the Canadian Securities Course. When he's not investing, Adam can usually be found traveling or skiing.\n\nThe tech sector in Canada is relatively healthy, but it's nothing comparable to the tech sector across the border, where some of the largest tech companies trade. The US is also leading the market in AI giants (including publicly traded ones) and promising AI startups. Compared to that, Canada has a modest concentration of businesses built around AI products and services, or companies that are pioneers in AI.\n\nStill, there are many Canadian companies, from both the tech and other sectors, that might be perfectly positioned to take advantage of the AI tailwinds sweeping through the market. Two of them stand out from the rest.\n\nThomson Reuters (TSX:TRI) originated in the newspaper business. The company has adhered to its pedigree and emerged as one of the most significant information conglomerates in the world. However, a big part of its business is specialized services and tools (products) for professionals from specific industries, predominantly legal and taxation.\n\nMany of its products are now augmented with generative AI, allowing them to serve their user base more effectively. The company is investing heavily, even aggressively, in AI, ensuring that its products remain competitive in their respective niche markets. AI adoption might be one of the factors behind its 6% revenue increase in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a modest discount of 9.2% from its yearly high, which is not enough to put it among undervalued stocks.\n\nThe decline started way earlier than the current market slump, but that slump will push the stock down further, so if you are planning on buying it at an even better price, it might be a good idea to wait to buy till later in the month. Even with that dip, the five-year returns of the stock were over 134%.\n\nShopify (TSX:SHOP) is one of the few Canadian tech giants with a massive global reach. It's among the largest e-commerce companies in the world and, at one time, was the most valuable publicly traded company in Canada.\n\nHowever, the stock experienced a significant correction, losing over 83% of its value at one point, and it's still in the process of recovering from that slump, though the recovery trajectory has been far from straight.\n\nThe company has made many changes in its business model/platform as well, and AI is a big part of this overall change. In addition to integrating AI functionalities in the core Shopify platform, the company is also experiencing a surge of AI apps and tools in the Shopify ecosystem.\n\nAssuming that all AI additions to the platform, whether company-owned or leveraged from third-party creators, become the catalyst for a new era of market dominance, investors might experience a growth surge similar to what defined the early days of Shopify's rapid rise.\n\nFrom tech stocks like Shopify to information-oriented businesses like Thomson Reuters, several publicly traded entities might experience exceptional organic growth thanks to AI. Adding them to your portfolio at the right time might allow you to capitalize on that growth and leverage the entire length of the bullish trend.", "source": {"uri": "fool.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_othman@fool.ca", "name": "Adam Othman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Motley Fool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial adviser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shopify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niche market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Business_to_Business", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Business to Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/a-robotic-hand-interacting-with-a-visual-ai-touchscreen-display-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Emerging Enforcement Against AI Washing", "body": "Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") is making its way into a wide variety of products, services, and business models. You've likely seen advertisements for AI-integrated products like laptops, refrigerators, and maybe even bird feeders. AI-powered services are also becoming more prevalent. There are now advertisements for a variety of investment services that claim to use novel AI-learning models and algorithms. When faced with a novel AI product or service, it is not uncommon for a tech-savvy consumer to ask: how exactly is artificial intelligence being used? This question is not always easily answered. When claims cross the line into false or misleading representations, there is a possibility of an \"AI washing\" allegation arising from the claim.\n\nAI washing refers to the practice of falsely advertising or exaggerating the use of AI within products and services as a means to attract investment and/or consumers. A non-specific example of AI washing would be advertising a product as AI-driven or AI-powered, when in reality, the product barely uses any AI functions beyond basic algorithms, or where machine learning, not AI, has been leveraged. Put another way, it would also be AI washing to exaggerate the functionality of the AI that is being used in a product, service or business model. Brought down to basics, AI washing is the over-selling or over-promising of the AI functionality of a product or service to garner interest by leveraging the current excitement surrounding AI developments and investments.\n\nAI washing is essentially an AI version of \"Greenwashing\", a similar practice which exaggerates or falsely advertises the environmental sustainability or carbon footprint of a product or service. Greenwashing is a practice many Canadians have heard of before, as the practice began in the 1980's, and has been more heavily enforced in the 21st Century to address the increased interest in sustainable products and investments. Canada's Competition Act was recently amended to introduce specific green-washing provisions.[1]\n\nIn the United States, AI washing enforcement has arrived. In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") released two enforcement actions against investment advisor firms for making false and misleading statements about their purported use of AI. The basis of both SEC enforcement actions was that both firms misled their clients and prospective clients by describing uses of AI in marketing materials that were untrue. More specifically, the SEC's orders took into account statements from the firms' SEC filings, press releases, and its website relating to the use of AI. The SEC noted in their press release that \"such AI washing hurts investors\", and directed readers to their investor alert regarding artificial intelligence and investment fraud.\n\nLooking to Canada, future enforcement actions or litigation attacking AI washing would likely come under securities law and/or competition law.\n\nIn the securities law context, there are disclosure obligations under each provincial securities law regimes that would catch false or misleading statements. For example, the civil liability provisions in Part XXIII of the Ontario Securities Act prohibit misrepresentations, defined as untrue statements of material fact, in a prospectus, offering memorandum, and in circulars. On the enforcement side, under section 126.2(1), misleading or untrue statements are an offence where:\n\nSimilar to the basis of the SEC enforcement, Ontario securities law generally accounts for misleading and false statements both to primary and secondary markets. The disclosure obligations under Ontario securities laws are very clear, and have had a history of application against green washing. Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect that they would be applied to instances of AI washing.\n\nIn fact, the Nova Scotia Securities Commission (\"NSSC\") has already published an article on its website in response to the recent SEC enforcement. The article addresses concerns regarding the practice of AI washing, and alerts investors to the practice, and its associated risks and harms.[2] This suggests that AI washing is now an issue the NSSC is monitoring.\n\nIn the competition context, AI washing could trigger two elements of the Competition Act: reviewable conduct (civil) and offences in relation to competition (criminal). It is reviewable conduct under section 74.01(1) of the Competition Act to make a material false or misleading representation to the public, or to make a representation to the public in the form of a statement of the performance or efficiency of a product that is not based on adequate and proper testing thereof. It is also an offence under section 52(1) of the Competition Act to knowingly or recklessly make a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect for the purpose of promoting the supply or use of a product or any business interest.\n\nUnder the Competition Act, sections 36 and 52 establish a private cause of action for anyone who suffers losses or damages as a result of conduct contrary to Part VI of the Act. The cause of action available here is also able to be gathered together into a class action, which is particularly relevant where losses or damages are suffered by shareholders and investors in publicly traded companies amongst other situations.\n\nBoth of these prohibitions could capture AI washing practices. Such representations may be seen as \"material\" because the presence and use of AI is closely related to a perceived increase in value of the product, service, or business interest. In this sense, references to AI will play a material role in the consumer decision making process. However, the materiality standard for false or misleading representations disappears for email subject headers under section 52.01 of the Competition Act, creating a strict liability issue for AI washing communicated through electronic messages.\n\nThe disclosure obligations and prohibitions against false or misleading statements under Canadian securities and competition law are the most obvious enforcement avenues to address AI washing. This is partially thanks to the similarities between AI washing and greenwashing, and the history of enforcement in that area. However, criminal law may also have an application.\n\nShould AI washing be used as a means to defraud Canadians for money, criminal law becomes a third source of law that could be used to address the practice. Fraud is an indictable offence under section 380(1) of the Criminal Code, and captures within it the defrauding of the public or any person of any property, money or valuable security or any service by deceit, falsehood or fraudulent means. The deceit at the core of AI washing could very well expose a person or company to criminal prosecution.\n\nWith all the excitement around AI, it is tempting to want to leverage the \"buzz\" when promoting new products or services. AI technology can also be quite complicated, and marketing and advertising teams may not fully appreciate the scope (and limitations) of an AI integration. For Canadian companies, let the recent SEC enforcements serve as a warning; enforcement against AI washing could well be on the horizon in Canada. Such enforcement could come under securities law, competition law, or in extreme cases, criminal law. Accordingly, the best practice is to exercise caution and to take care to confirm that any AI-related claims are true, accurate, and can be substantiated.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenwashing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Securities fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_of_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cause of action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Act_of_1933", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Securities Act of 1933"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_filing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SEC filing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

It provides tools for tasks such as data preparation for training AI models, including large language models.\n\nFurthermore, Knime supports the sharing of workflows and collaboration across disciplines, and provides the ability for users to deploy and monitor insights across their entire organization. It's also a foundation for building data applications and knowledge bases, the company says.\n\nToday's investment coincides with some key updates for the two major components of the Knime platform. For instance, the Knime Analytics Platform is now \"cloud- and browser-ready,\" with a new user interface that will help reduce the learning curve for novice data scientists, while improving productivity for more advanced users. One of its main new features is \"K-AI,\" which is a generative AI assistant that supports natural language queries to assist users in their data science projects.\n\nMeanwhile, the enterprise-grade Knime Business Hub has been re-engineered from the ground up to support automation, collaboration, deployment and governance of data analytics and AI models, the company explained.\n\nKnime co-founder and Chief Executive Michael Berthold said the company's two main product offerings help information technology and technical leaders figure out how to proliferate generative AI innovation while still making sure data is kept safe.\n\n\"The Knime Analytics Platform has no barrier to entry and its open-source nature allows a large community of workflow developers to access and build with generative AI technology, both now and in the future,\" Berthold said. \"At the same time, Knime Business Hub allows for defining controls and governing access to data and models, precisely in the way that a given enterprise would like to define.\"\n\nIn addition to updating those products, Knime said it's launching a new, software-as-a-service offering, called the Team Plan for Knime Community Hub, which provides flexible, pay-as-you-go options for smaller organizations.\n\nInvus Managing Director Mario Kaloustian said Knime's platform enables fast and widespread data science adoption across organizations. \"This model answers the key question for the C-suite of every company,\" he said. \"How do we accelerate innovation with generative AI while managing associated risks?\"\n\nHaving been around since 2017, Knime has attracted quite a significant customer base, despite not making many headlines since generative AI burst onto the tech scene in late 2022 with the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The startup says it's generating revenue of more than 30 million euros ($32.6 million) annually, and is growing at a rate of 30% to 40% per year.\n\nIts customer base has grown to more than 400 enterprises, including some well-known names such as AMSL Holding NV, Audi AG, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Eli Lilly and Co., Novartis AG, Bayer AG, Sanofi SA, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration, Genentech Inc. and Mercedes-Benz AG. All told, the platform has a user base of almost a half-million globally, the company claims.\n\nBerthold said Kinme's open-source approach to data science is the main reason for its popularity, removing virtually every barrier to entry, while remaining adaptive to the needs of an AI industry that's evolving at rapid speed.\n\n\"Open-source enabled us to integrate with any data technology on the market,\" he explained. \"So as new developments like generative AI appear, Knime can support them immediately. It can integrate with more technology than proprietary tools, and can integrate with them faster.\"\n\nIn addition, open source also enabled Knime to build up a large community around its products. \"Our community consistently shares working examples that cover all of the application areas for Knime, and this allows us to have a vast repository for use cases in any industry or discipline,\" the CEO said.\n\nAccording to Berthold, the company's traction and the rise of generative AI is what prompted it to take on additional funding for the first time in over seven years.\n\n\"We have been aiming to grow at a sustainable rate and didn't initially have any plans for further investment,\" he said. \"But we decided to take it once we saw the rapid innovation in generative AI.

One of the most transformative applications lies in surveillance. Drones equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing surveillance systems, offering unprecedented levels of autonomous navigation, precision, and insight.\n\nTraditional UAVs surveillance technology for large military surveillance which was used for intelligence gathering, and monitor borders have long relied on stationary cameras, human monitoring, and manual data analysis. While being effective to an extent, these methods were limited by the static nature of cameras and the fallibility of human operators. Today, Surveillance in Industry has taken tech advancement from high-resolution cameras, Low-Noise Propulsion, infrared cameras, LED Lighting technology, heat sensors. Features like AI, LiDAR systems, Smart automation software and facial recognition technology are aiding segment of logistics, agricultural practices, environmental conservation efforts, military reconnaissance, and emergency responses. Drones, with their ability to traverse diverse terrains and capture high-resolution imagery from various angles, present a significant upgrade. However, the true inflection point is the AI technology.\n\nAI enhances drone surveillance by handling vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. Machine learning algorithms can analyse video feeds in real-time, identifying patterns and anomalies that might elude human viewpoint. This is crucial in scenarios where rapid decision-making is essential, such as in CI/CT operations or disaster management responses.\n\nFor instance, in crowd monitoring, AI-Drones can detect unusual movements or formations that might signal a security threat. In wildlife conservation, they can track animal movements and detect poaching activities. These applications demonstrate the adaptability and centrality of AI in enhancing the operability of drone.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of AI Drones is real-time data analysis. Unlike traditional systems that require hours or even days to process data, AI algorithms can analyse it on-the-fly. This immediate processing ability is vital for time-sensitive operations. Considering search and rescue missions where drones are equipped with thermal imaging and AI can quickly locate missing persons in challenging terrains, significantly reducing response times and increasing the chances of successful rescues. Similarly, in urban environments, AI can help government to monitor traffic patterns, detect accidents, and manage crowd control during certain events.\n\nAI's allows for continuously improving accuracy in surveillance. This means better identification and tracking of objects and targets. Advanced AI models can differentiate between animals, humans, and vehicles, and even recognize specific individuals through facial recognition technology.\n\nThis precision is particularly beneficial in perimeter security for critical infrastructure, where detecting unauthorized access promptly can prevent potential breaches. Furthermore, in agriculture, AI-powered drones can monitor crop health with high accuracy, identifying issues such as pest infestations or water stress before they become severe problems.\n\nHuman error is an inevitable risk in traditional surveillance systems. Fatigue, distraction, and cognitive overload can lead to missed detections or false alarms. AI mitigates these risks by providing consistent and unbiased analysis. It operates tirelessly, maintaining vigilance where human operators might falter.\n\nMoreover, It can aid human operators by highlighting potential issues and provide actionable insights, allowing them to focus on decision-making rather than data processing. This synergy between human expertise and AI enhances overall surveillance effectiveness.\n\nPredictive analytics is another fragment where AI significantly enhances drone surveillance. By analysing pervious data, AI algorithms can predict future events or trends. This capability is invaluable in sectors such as wildlife monitoring, logistics, law enforcement where anticipating criminal activities can lead to proactive measures rather than reactive responses.\n\nFor example, AI can identify patterns in crime data, helping authorities allocate resources more effectively and prevent incidents before they occur. In environmental monitoring, predictive analytics can forecast natural disasters like floods or wildfires, enabling timely evacuation and mitigation efforts.\n\nWhile AI-driven drone surveillance offers numerous benefits, it also raises ethical and privacy concerns. The potential for misuse or overreach is significant, particularly in terms of unwarranted surveillance and data privacy. It is crucial to establish clear regulations and guidelines to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically.\n\nTransparency in data collection and processing, along with stringent data protection measures, can help mitigate these concerns. Furthermore, involving stakeholders in the development and deployment of AI surveillance systems ensures that diverse perspectives and potential impacts are considered.\n\nThe integration of AI in drone surveillance systems is still in its early stages, but the potential is immense. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even greater precision, efficiency, and predictive capabilities. This evolution will not only enhance security and operational efficiency but also open new avenues for innovation across various sectors.", "source": {"uri": "expresscomputer.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express Computer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "express_computer@expresscomputer.in", "name": "Express Computer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facial recognition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermographic_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermographic camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crowd control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poaching"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices_and_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices and Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn1.expresscomputer.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/05121112/Drones-fighting-Covid-19.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

From finance to the supply chain, to retail, countless organizations are finding ways to gradually integrate advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, into the workflow to streamline their processes and enhance productivity.\n\nThe newsroom is no different - as reporters, public relations and marketing professionals, and news editors and distributors will tell you, the turn to AI and other forms of technology have completely transformed the news industry. In a recent study from The Associated Press amongst individuals in the news industry, 73.8% of those surveyed indicated that they or their organization have already used generative AI in some capacity, and it's a number that's sure to grow.\n\nAt Business Wire, we recognize the importance of this new generative technology. Our own newsroom editors and technology experts continue to evaluate the best tools to streamline news production and workflows. However, our point of view is clear: the role of the human editor is more critical than ever before. To ensure newsrooms are striking the perfect balance between reaping the benefits of technology, and ensuring humans are involved in the process, organizations can consider the following tips to guide their efforts:\n\nMarketing Technology News: MarTech Interview with Stacy Bohrer, VP of Buyer Development (North America) @ OpenX\n\nLeverage technology to expedite and streamline manual processes, rather than a substitute for everyday work.\n\nHowever, just because AI is capable of being used for all these tasks does not indicate that it should be used for all of them. Whereas previously the editorial process could take a significant amount of time to account for writing, editing, and researching and gathering data, this effort can be substantially shortened as a result of new AI technology. This includes streamlining the editorial process through the automation of routine tasks, enhancing data accuracy, and even providing an extra hand if there's a shortage in the newsroom to help with drafting copy. However, just because AI is capable of being used for all these tasks does not indicate that it should be used for all of them.\n\nIt's important to identify the areas in the new reporting process where AI can augment productivity and aid the workflow, rather than replace workers and perform their activities. AI, for instance, will be particularly resourceful for time-consuming tasks, such as conducting research and identifying emerging trends. Allowing AI to handle these more repetitive tasks will give back time to reporters and newsroom staff to focus on other more pressing tasks that require their attention. In turn, this will create a more productive and streamlined work environment.\n\nProvide humans a larger role in the review process to ensure responsible and thoughtful oversight of these technologies.\n\nAs necessary as these advances in technology are, they can't make up for one thing: the human element. Even if technology helps to improve productivity and efficiency within the newsroom, it cannot beat having a human on the other side to ensure total accuracy. And as AI continues to take hold in the professional world, it's going to be more important than ever to have humans present to ensure everything flows smoothly.\n\nIt's a common misperception that as AI is folded into the workflow, the role of humans will largely diminish or be seen as nonessential. Make no mistake - as the role of technology increases, so does the role of humans. To ensure these advanced technologies are running smoothly, efficiently, and with minimal risk of potential bias or hallucinations, as AI can at times suffer from, there need to be humans tasked with oversight.\n\nWhat does this mean for the newsroom? As AI becomes introduced and relied on to feed information pertaining to data, trends, and other research activities, it will become vital for reporters and newsroom staff to review and supervise these technologies to best determine what to do with the information they generate. This greatly reduces the likelihood of any erroneously produced outputs and allows reporters the relief of knowing whatever information they will share with the public has been fact-checked and proofed by a reputable source.\n\nEstablish the right guidelines and rules in place to ensure technology and humans can work harmoniously and fairly.\n\nLastly, a helpful tip for newsrooms and organizations to consider is to establish a set of rules and guidelines, to ensure reporters, editors, and other staff are using technology in a way that is not only effective and productive, but responsible, safe, and cost-effective. Some large media organizations have already put such resources in place. A plan like this would include how to responsibly utilize AI technologies and for which tasks, how to do so in a way that does not compromise journalistic integrity, ethics, or organizational safety and security, and could even establish who is allowed to utilize AI.\n\nA structured, organized set of guidelines established early on will ensure that humans and AI technologies are on a level playing field and that both parties can rely on one another to promote efficacy and productivity.\n\nAs we're moving towards a technologically advanced world, it will be critical to assess which scenarios the involvement of a human is essential to maintain integrity and authenticity of work. The newsroom will remain a place where technology, human expertise, and judgment meet to ensure accurate, reliable, and trustworthy information.\n\nMarketing Technology News: Why Marketers Need to Modernize and Switch to Hybrid Data Hosting\n\nThe SalesStar Podcast -", "source": {"uri": "martechseries.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarTech Series"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Newsroom (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Wire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenX_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenX (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Associations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Non-Profit", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Non-Profit", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://martechseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Jessica_Anderson_Business_Wire_martech-strike-a-balance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Our mission is to help you identify the trends that will have the biggest impact on the future.\n\nNot really an innovation, per se, but: our top spot this week goes to Google, which has been found in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act for monopolizing search by a US District Court judge. Of course, the company has already announced it plans to appeal the decision. In the interim, the ruling won't really affect the search giant's position (or how users browse the web). And as ZDNET contributor Steven Vaughan-Nichols points out, if we use US versus Microsoft as a reference, it's unlikely Google will be hit that hard by the decision anyway. At the same time, however, search is evolving -- OpenAI has finally revealed SearchGPT, if preliminarily, and other AI-powered engines are springing up all over the place. Especially after the company's AI Overview feature flopped, Google's future may not be as secure as it might think.\n\nComing in second is Samsung for delivering elements of its Galaxy AI to more devices -- several million mid-range models, to be precise -- sometime in the next two months. This move is especially notable as the release of Apple Intelligence, in beta and actuality, lags, and contrasts with the fact that Apple's AI will only be available to select newer models due to its processing requirements. With reports that the company may even charge a monthly subscription fee for Apple Intelligence, Samsung's rollout looks competitive. Even if users need to purchase Samsung's newest model to access every Galaxy AI feature, something is better than nothing.\n\nIn spot #3 is the AI agent and its impact on our working lives. Research from McKinsey shows that agentic systems, which can act independently, will increasingly influence how AI is deployed. Though they aren't new, AI agents now have more agency thanks to generative AI's natural language abilities, and are moving \"from thought to action\". The development means big changes in how all kinds of roles, technical and otherwise, are carried out. In short, we can expect to share the proverbial water cooler with more AI agents soon.\n\nClosing out the Index this week is the steady creep of the mundane AI scam into our everyday lives, even our relatively offline hobbies. ZDNET's David Gewirtz looked into how AI-generated knitting and crochet patterns create headaches for crafters because, much like AI-generated code, they don't always work in the real world. The problem is an example of the larger consequences of gen AI content becoming normalized in many environments: it's easier than ever to churn out and sell digital material quickly, cheaply, and at scale, and the results are harder to spot.

However, the problem with this excitement is that it typically raises expectations beyond what is delivered or experienced. It is therefore vital to understand the fundamental building blocks that underpin the successful deployment of AI systems within the IP profession. This starts with data and data quality.\n\nThe importance of training data in the development of AI\n\nAll applications that harness AI depend on the quality of input data. While it seems obvious that poor input data will lead to poor output, it is difficult to apply this basic rule to the plethora of readily available AI solutions. For example, with machine translation, one enters source text in one language and output-target text in another. There are significant quality differences between the many different available algorithms, some of which can be attributed to how - and when - the algorithm was trained, while others depend on the technology deployed.\n\nThe development of AI dates back to Alan Turing in the 1950s or before. It comes in many forms, including unsupervised and supervised machine learning, and now generative AI. Even if one focuses only on gen AI, there are many large language models to choose from, which have fundamentally different capabilities. For example, in a Statista 2023 ranking, Claude 3 Opus (Anthropics) scored 60.1% for ability to solve mathematical problems, while Gemini Pro (Google) scored 32.6% (and the improved Gemini 1.5 Pro scored 58.5%).\n\nChoosing the right approach for a problem\n\nElon Musk has suggested that gen AI has the potential to unleash a new era of human innovation, and this means many things for the IP profession. For an innovator at the heart of an R&D team, it could accelerate a project or stimulate new lines of inquiry. For a patent professional, it could automate drafting or reduce the administrative burden of handling prosecution before an examiner.\n\nThere are several strategic considerations that go to the heart of the risk and value associated with patent rights. These include:\n\nThis overview does an injustice to the broad and diverse spectrum of opportunities for intellectual property, but herein lies the challenge. Many calling for more AI are thinking only about enhanced efficiency. For IP professionals, this means delivering better, faster and cheaper solutions than the current approaches and in the world of AI, this triangle must acquire new dimensions, such as trust and transparency.\n\nData quality\n\nThe answer to these conundrums can be illustrated by patent analytics. The ability to digitally search for patents only started in 1998, and by 2006 patent data was ubiquitous and recognised as an essential source of scientific information. Today, there are dozens of proprietary patent data products, and many more if you include the services offered by national and international patent offices. It is crucial to focus on the following when choosing the right source of patent analytics.\n\nAs patent data continues to grow in importance, it has become increasingly apparent that it is often insufficient. Some of the strategic use cases for patent analytics include:\n\nKey takeaways\n\nWhile AI is critical, the starting point is understanding why. If you know the problem you want to solve, this can be your guide to the data that you need. In the field of patents, not all data is the same. Even when dealing with ostensibly identical datasets, focus on quality is essential. If you engage with incomplete or inaccurate datasets, then AI cannot begin to help. In the world of patent analytics, 'rubbish-in' only ever has one outcome. This is true whether you are reviewing the data manually or using the latest in gen AI.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine translation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supervised learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Turing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statista", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statista"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Indeed, this article is validated, with AI data centres currently using around 2% of total global electricity, with untold gallons of water extracted as coolant.\n\nAs AI adoption continues, this resource usage is only expected to grow, and GlobalData predicts that data centre power consumption will more than double by 2026.\n\nHowever, this article argues for the opposite, accepting that even in the face of these issues, AI has the potential to be, and currently is being applied as, a useful tool to help companies reach their sustainability objectives.\n\nThe primary argument of the article is that AI consumes insurmountable amounts of carbon-emitting electricity. This is certainly backed up by the statistics, with many large tech companies that have traditionally masqueraded as green having increased their carbon emissions in recent years. For example, Google cites a rise of 48% since 2019.\n\nHowever, arguments against AI's green credentials fail to consider that energy can be produced renewably. As the quantity of electricity generated from renewable sources increases, there is a massive opportunity for technology companies to sustainably power their data centres.\n\nThe prospects are good, with Carbon Brief, a leading climate change website, claiming the world is on track in the next five years to add enough renewable electricity to the global grid to power the equivalent of the US and Canada. This year (2024) has only seen estimates increase, with an extra 728GW added to predictions in 2023 (roughly the combined power consumption of India and Germany), signalling confidence in a renewable future.\n\nAlthough this is major progress, it is still far from the tripling of renewables by 2030 that COP28 promised. Therefore, tech companies are also looking at other options. Google and Amazon have both signed deals with Occidental, a major US-based energy company, to use carbon capture technology to negate their emissions, allowing a temporary solution to energy usage issues until renewable capacity can be increased further.\n\nFurther innovations are also being implemented by technology companies to help them cope with the higher energy intensity of AI. For example, IBM is using biomimicry to copy aspects of the human brain to reduce energy usage. Instead of traditional binary, these chips use memristors, which can 'remember' past levels of electric charge, giving them a memory akin to the brain.\n\nIn addition, Google is using AI to directly tackle its growing energy usage. Its DeepMind platform has been utilised to reduce the energy usage of its data centres, providing real-time data that can subsequently be used to cool its data centres more efficiently. Using this technology, the company claims to have generated reductions of up to 40% in its data centre emissions.\n\nOther companies are starting to see the benefits of using AI as a platform for emissions reductions, with General Electric Vernova's CERius software being explicitly designed to help better report and plan emissions reduction strategies. In this example, AI technology helps drastically reduce the level of estimation involved in the emissions reporting process.\n\nThe climate crisis consists of much more than just carbon dioxide emissions. Biodiversity loss is also a major environmental issue in desperate need of solving. The WWF claims that an average decrease in species populations of 69% has occurred since 1970, while the IUCN identifies more than 45,000 species threatened with extinction worldwide. This is an area in which AI's full potential is being unleashed.\n\nFirstly, AI can be used to take stock of what wildlife still exists. Google has been using AI to identify remaining areas of kelp forest off the coast of Australia, a traditionally labour-intensive job that can now be completed at speed, freeing up valuable time for other tasks.\n\nSecondly, AI can be used to help renew these ecosystems. Dendra Systems, a UK-based startup, is using it as an afforestation aid, flying drones that, in addition to taking stock of species, can precisely disperse plant seeds, encouraging forests to regenerate. Furthermore, a recent Verdict article shows how AI can also be used to predict deforestation, allowing us to better mitigate against it.\n\nThe same skills that AI possesses in species identification can also be harnessed effectively in the circular economy sector. Recycling remains a large issue, with only 43% of waste recycled in the UK.\n\nHowever, by using AI, this figure could increase further, as several companies, including conglomerate Unilever, are using the technology to quickly identify different types of plastic and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling, helping to speed up the circular economy sector while cutting costs.\n\nThese innovations show that there is clear potential for AI to solve some of the world's key environmental issues. Ultimately though, its green legacy will depend on whether technology companies can adapt quickly enough to its ever-growing energy intensity. There are positive signs that this is happening, with predictions of a renewable future growing in stature while, in the meantime, other innovative uses for the technology prove their worth.",

The quote, attributed to author Joanna Maciejewska, is, \"I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.\"\n\nIn a recent Op-Ed for The Guardian, Daniel Kehlmann described a conversation with a Hollywood screenwriter friend about an advanced screenplay AI still in development. Kehlmann's friend tested the AI by describing a miniseries - characters, plot, and atmosphere - and within minutes, the AI produced all the episodes, fully written and ready for production. The result was smart, targeted, witty, and creative. The screenwriter's ultimate takeaway from the experience?\n\n\"I have three years left. Maybe five if I'm lucky.\"\n\nThe rise of ChatGPT and the Large Language Model have directly correlated to a rising sense of unease among many creatives in and out of radio, which is, in my eyes, completely justified. I deeply love this industry, but we haven't exactly proven we will always protect the artistry of our business when given the choice over cost.\n\nJacobs Media's just-released AQ6 data shows 77% of air talent are worried about staff reductions, and while economic concerns are certainly a part of that, AI was largely perceived as an imminent danger for job losses within the industry. There's a reason why agents and unions are building protective clauses into the contracts of talent and workers to shield them from bad-faith uses of generative AI.\n\nSome days it feels like the industries safest from AI replacements are ditch diggers and plumbers.\n\nDuring my Production Director days, if someone had given me the choice of having an AI bot to take care of affidavits or one to write complete commercials for me, I would have chosen affidavits in a heartbeat. (Some have the \"dead air\" dreams. Me? Endless affidavit nightmares.) They're important, but not what I joined radio to do. I would have happily traded all the time I spent selecting (Y) for time to think of new copy that made my AEs nervous.\n\nIt's only a matter of time until a group okays an AI-generated spec spot to go straight to air after the client says yes to the idea. And I don't blame the companies that create those products for the loss - the blame would lay on those that would take the final shortcut. The same goes for air talent. There's a difference between, \"We can't afford a hire,\" and, \"Why should we pay for a hire?\"\n\nWhy should I pay my hard-earned money to go see the latest blockbuster in a movie theater, when I can just pirate it on my computer at home? Well, not only is it a higher quality experience for the audience, but it supports the entire chain that creates that content in the first place.\n\nAm I anti-AI? Not at all. There are phenomenal ways AI assists creatives - assists being the keyword. I simply think it would be a travesty if we all looked up from our prompt boxes ten years from now and realized we had left the fun parts of radio up to a machine. Creating a good commercial is fun. Hitting post is fun. The humanity of radio is fun.\n\nWe shouldn't fear AI, but we should all fear the day we choose to completely automate the creative process.", "source": {"uri": "radioink.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Ink"}, "authors": [{"uri": "radio_ink@radioink.com", "name": "Radio Ink", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kehlmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Kehlmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burlesque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightmare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://radioink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0674-scaled-e1723149382394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Remember, a one-liner is not a standard introduction.\n\n-- It may consist of basic information by giving some definitions from the trusted source and authentic facts.\n\nBody\n\n-- It is the central part of the answer and one should understand the demand of the question to provide rich content.\n\n-- The answer must be preferably written as a mix of points and short paragraphs rather than using long paragraphs or just points.\n\n-- Using facts from authentic government sources makes your answer more comprehensive. Analysis is important based on the demand of the question, but do not over analyse.\n\nQUESTION 1: Discuss the key objectives and challenges associated with the India AI mission. How can the government address the digital divide to achieve the mission's goals?\n\nNote: This is not a model answer. It only provides you with thought process which you may incorporate into the answers.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n-- The IndiaAI Mission seeks to create a comprehensive ecosystem that encourages AI innovation by democratising computing access, improving data quality, developing indigenous AI capabilities, attracting top AI talent, facilitating industry collaboration, providing startup risk capital, ensuring socially impactful AI projects, and promoting ethical AI.\n\n-- This mission promotes the responsible and inclusive growth of India's AI ecosystem through the following seven pillars:\n\nYou may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer:\n\nObjectives\n\n-- To implement intelligent systems in a variety of decision-making processes, improve connection, and increase productivity.\n\n-- To apply intelligent systems to meet India's societal demands in sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, smart cities, infrastructure, and mobility.\n\n-- To generate new information and build novel applications for intelligent systems.\n\nWhat are the challenges associated with IndiaAI?\n\n-- Data security and privacy issues\n\n-- Limited AI expertise and lack of investment to implement AI solutions\n\n-- Lack of integrity and ethics with AI and ML solutions\n\nHow can the government address the digital divide to achieve the mission's goals?\n\n-- With the rapid expansion of generative AI and the introduction of newer and more powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), countries and organisations around the world are racing to stay up with the rapid advancements and jockey for leadership positions.\n\n-- The goal is to increase compute capacity to meet local demand while also bridging the \"AI divide\" by providing low-cost compute for targeted industries.\n\n-- The technology is advancing at breakneck speed, with Nvidia releasing new versions every 12 months. The game will inevitably go beyond Nvidia, with Intel, AMD, startups such as Cerebrus, and every major technology corporation releasing their own AI-focused CPUs.\n\n-- AI is a vital technology that the country must maintain control over. As a result, the government should form strong contractual relationships and provide a clear mandate that this sovereign AI capacity be hosted within the country's boundaries.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-- The Cabinet has budgeted Rs 10,372 crore for this effort. It is built around a few important pillars, including dataset platforms, innovation and application development centres, and future skills, as well as startup finance and a focus on safe and trusted AI.\n\n-- Both the AI for All plan and the IndiaAI Mission are commendable moves by the government; but, it must now collaborate with industry and geopolitical allies to ensure that its tenets are effectively implemented and that we become leaders in this inevitable age of AI.\n\n(Source: IndiaAI Mission: How the government can realise its goal of AI without a digital divide by Jaspreet Bindra, indiaai.gov.in)\n\nElucidate the relationship between globalisation and new technology in a world of scarce resources, with special reference to India.

(2021)\n\nQUESTION 2: Examine the historical and cultural significance of the Prime Meridian and its role in global timekeeping.\n\nNote: This is not a model answer. It only provides you with thought process which you may incorporate into the answers.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n-- The prime meridian is the line of 0\u00b0 longitude, which serves as the beginning point for measuring distances east and west around the Earth. The prime meridian is arbitrary, thus it might be anywhere.\n\n-- The prime meridian separates the eastern and western hemispheres. The International Date Line is located halfway around the planet, at 180 degrees longitude.\n\n-- The Prime Meridian and the International Date Line form a circle that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. This is comparable to how the Equator acts as the 0\u00b0 latitude line, dividing the Earth into the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nBody:\n\nYou may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer:\n\nHistorical and cultural significance in India\n\n-- The Ujjain prime meridian is first mentioned in the ancient Sanskrit work Surya Siddhanta, which was written between the fourth and eighth century CE.\n\n-- The literature offers sophisticated ideas about astronomy, geography, and mathematics, ranging from the motion of celestial bodies to the procedure for calculating sine values.\n\n-- According to Surya Siddhanta's mythology, the scripture was a revelation from the Sun God (or Surya) to the asura Maya.\n\n-- In the first chapter of the Surya Siddhanta, the concept of a prime meridian (also known as rekha or 'line') is introduced in regard to the method for estimating planetary position.\n\n-- Some scholars believe Ujjain's relative location vis-a-vis ancient trade routes had something to do with the prime meridian passing through it.\n\n-- Burgess wrote in his accompanying commentary to Surya Siddhanta \"Of all the centres of Hindu culture, it lay nearest to the great ocean-route by which, during the first three centuries of our era, so important a commerce was carried on between Alexandria, as the mart of Rome, and India... That the prime meridian was made to pass through this city proves it to have been the cradle of the Hindu science of astronomy, or its principal seat during its early history.\"\n\nRole of Prime Meridian in global timekeeping\n\n-- To symbolise zero degrees longitude -- the line splitting the world in half -- a prime meridian is arbitrarily selected. From this line, one can measure any position east or west. For example, in his Geographia from the second century CE, the Alexandrian polymath Ptolemy traced his prime meridian through the Insulae Fortunatae (the \"Fortunate Isles,\" which are today's Canary Islands) off the western coast of Africa.\n\n-- The world became increasingly interconnected and time became standardised in the 19th century because of technological advancements like the telegraph, steamships, and railroads.\n\n-- In 1884, the International Meridian Conference was held in Washington, DC, where representatives from 26 countries decided to \"adopt a single prime meridian for all nations, in place of the multiplicity of initial meridians which now exist\".\n\n-- The prime meridian also establishes Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC does not alter daylight savings time or anything else. The prime meridian is the standard for longitude, while UTC is the standard for time. All countries and regions use UTC to measure their time zones.\n\n-- The prime meridian also contributes to the International Date Line. The 180\u00b0 longitude line is halfway between the prime meridian and the Earth's longitude, which is 360\u00b0. The International Date Line refers to the meridian at 180\u00b0 longitude.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-- Much like the Equator divides Earth into the northern and southern hemispheres by acting as the 0\u00b0 latitude line, the prime meridian and the International Date Line form a circle that divides Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.\n\n-- The Eastern Hemisphere is located east of the prime meridian and west of the International Date Line, and it includes the majority of Earth's landmasses, including all of Asia and Australia and most of Africa.\n\n(Source: From Ujjain to Greenwich: a brief history of prime meridians by Arjun Sengupta, education.nationalgeographic.org)\n\nPoints to Ponder\n\nDifference between prime meridian and International date line\n\nMajor hot deserts in northern hemisphere are located between 20-30 deg N latitudes and on the western side of the continents.

A brief overview of these developments is set out below.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nTo date, the UK has taken a principles-based, \"pro-innovation\" approach to AI that relied on the application of existing laws rather than introducing dedicated AI legislation. This announcement therefore marks a potential shift in the UK's approach to AI regulation.\n\nThere is limited information available but the government has indicated that regulation will focus on \"the handful of companies developing the most powerful AI models\". The government has not yet confirmed that it will bring forward legislation, but speaking before the election, Peter Kyle, who is now the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, indicated that the government would introduce a \"statutory code\" requiring companies to release test data for scrutiny by the government's AI safety institute. Kyle also indicated, however, that \"we don't want to stop this development\", suggesting that the government may stop short of the full prohibitions seen in the EU AI Act and instead impose targeted guardrails on the highest-risk models, such as those currently considered \"general-purpose AI systems\" under the EU AI Act.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nThe Cyber Security and Resilience Bill will be brought before Parliament in the coming months to \"strengthen the UK's cyber defences\". This announcement follows the previous government's consultation on updates to the UK's Network and Information Security (NIS) Regulations, and the proposed changes set out in the government's briefing note on the King's Speech are broadly aligned with the EU's recent amendments to its NIS Directive. However, ransomware is a priority for UK authorities following high-profile incidents affecting the National Health Service, Ministry of Defence and local councils, and the briefing note includes a hint that the government will go further than the EU NIS Directive amendments by requiring companies to report ransom incidents and payments.\n\nData Use\n\nThe Digital Information and Smart Data Bill will also be introduced, aimed at streamlining data use and sharing, including through new exemptions for scientific research and a new legislative regime for digital identity providers. The bill will restructure the UK's privacy regulator and introduce \"targeted reforms\" to data laws to improve clarity.

We highlight below the key proposed new regulations (\"Bills\") which indicate the direction that the new Government is taking in relation to internet regulation in the UK:\n\nDigital Information and Smart Data Bill (\"DISD\")\n\nThe Government has proposed the DISD Bill which replaces the previously proposed Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (\"DPDI\") introducing a variety of provisions that range from digital identity to data protection. Most notably, the proposal includes a new data preservation process with specific relevance in the context of Online Safety, which has been raised in the context of Ofcom's (the UK's online safety regulator) ongoing implementation of the UK's Online Safety Act, as well as a framework to set up Smart Data schemes.\n\nThe DISD Bill reforms the current UK data protection regime and in some areas will diverge from the EU GDPR (e.g. regarding processing for research purposes, solely automated decision making, appointment of representatives, other substantive provisions and regarding the role and functions of the UK regulator - the Information Commissioner's Office). For some aspects, this may give greater clarity or in fact raise the bar in terms of data protection compliance, but in others the regulatory compliance burden on organisations may be lessened. The Government will therefore need to walk a fine line to ensure that the UK's reformed regime will not be seen to be too light touch on data protection such that it could put the European Commission's adequacy decision (which allows personal data to pass freely from the EU to the UK) to be put at risk.\n\nCyber Security and Resilience Bill (\"CSR\")\n\nThis Bill was proposed in response to the increasing frequency and severity of cyber-attacks affecting entities in critical sections and their supply chains. The CSR Bill aims to address existing vulnerabilities and strengthen the UK's defence against cyber threats by expanding the scope of the current cyber regulations, empowering regulators and increasing reporting requirements.\n\nIn the EU by comparison, the NIS directive is being superseded by the NIS 2 Directive. Having left the EU, the UK will not be implementing the NIS 2 Directive, NIS 2 entered into force on 16 January 2023 and should be brought into national law by EU Member States by 17 October 2024. The recent draft implementing regulation which will apply to entities such as cloud computing service providers, data centre providers, providers of online marketplaces, search engines and social network platforms, sets out technical and methodological requirements for risk management measures and the criteria for when an incident can be considered significant for those entities.\n\nProduct Safety and Metrology Bill\n\nThis Bill aims to preserve the UK's status as a global leader in product regulation and aims to ensure a level playing field between high street and online marketplaces. It also pledges to support businesses and foster innovation whilst protecting consumers.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nDespite recent press reports, the Government has not committed to introducing AI-specific legislation in this Parliamentary session, but the Government has indicated that their priority is to specifically regulate the developers of the most powerful AI models. The UK at present has an AI Regulation Framework that draws on existing laws and regulations.\n\nBy comparison, the EU has already brought into force (as of 1 August) the widely publicised EU AI Act, which establishes a regulatory and legal framework for the use of AI models and systems within the EU.\n\nWe shall provide further updates as each draft Bill makes its journey through the legislative process.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_from_the_throne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech from the throne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_shekel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli new shekel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate social responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner's_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information Commissioner's Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Methodology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 3584, "textEnd": 3592}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 62, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, Rs 255 crore has been set aside for the establishment of three Centres of Excellence (CoEs) in AI, further solidifying India's AI infrastructure.\n\nIndia's participation in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) and its role as the incoming council chair highlight the country's leadership and commitment to the responsible development and use of AI on the global stage.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitin_Prasada", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jitin Prasada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Electronics_and_Information_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-moving_consumer_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast-moving consumer goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASSCOM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASSCOM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Languages of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/jitin-prasada-2024-07-01ce79598c8454a3bba354d333c7d7ec-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 460899615, "relevance": 2}

This Act aims to strike a balance between reducing AI-related risks and promoting the use of AI, whilst ensuring the EU remains a global leader in AI innovation and investment. Businesses have 3 years to fully comply with the legislation, with all key obligations to be in place within the next 24 months.\n\nThe Act focuses heavily on protecting people's health, safety and rights from the risks associated with AI. It categorises AI based on risk, breaking this down into four risk categories. This risk-based approach represents a key objective of the EU to remain competitive and have proportionate regulation of AI. It is designed to ensure that AI is applied safely and that the obligations that are required under the legislation does not act as a deterrent against the safe application of AI.\n\nThe Act applies to creators, distributers and users of AI systems who deploy AI in a professional capacity in the EU, as well as to third-country providers of AI (if their AI outputs affect the EU).\n\nAI categorised under the Unacceptable-Risk category are prohibited. The category includes systems that could pose a threat to the safety, livelihoods or fundamental rights of citizens. Examples given in the Act include:\n\nThe majority of the Act focuses on high-risk AI systems, which face strict regulations. These include AI used in:\n\nThis category is smaller in comparison to the other three and obligations are lesser, focusing on transparency. It provides that developers and providers must ensure that end-users are aware that they are interacting with AI. For example, users should be knowledgeable that they are interacting with AI when engaging with a chatbot or deep-fake.\n\nSystems which do not fall under any of the other three categories are unregulated. This category includes the majority of AI applications currently available on the EU single market, such as AI-enabled video games and spam filters.\n\nHigh-Risk AI is subject to strict regulations before it may be put on the market including the following:\n\nThe European AI Office was established by the European Commission to the AI Act's enforcement at EU level. At a national level, EU Member States must establish their own national competent authorities to enforce the rules in their countries before next August. Companies found not to be in compliance with the Act could face fines potentially amounting up to \u20ac35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.\n\nThis legislation will be welcomed by a wide variety of businesses seeking to make use of the benefits that come with AI. The balance struck in the Act between risk mitigation and promotion of the use of AI systems is designed to ensure legal certainty for developers and users while also encouraging market uptake of AI. Companies intending to use AI in the EU must familiarise themselves with the Act, understand the risk categories, and comply with all obligations to avoid hefty penalties and successfully leverage AI technologies.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regulation (European Union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_certainty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal certainty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794596", "eventUri": "eng-9794596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 460907552, "relevance": 2}

Before returning to the United States, Biden honored America\u2019s war dead at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery about an hour outside Paris. He placed a wreath at the cemetery chapel before an expanse of white headstones marking the final resting place of more than 2,200 U.S. soldiers who fought in World War I. It was a solemn end to five days in which Trump was an unspoken yet unavoidable presence. On the surface, the trip marked the 80th anniversary of D-Day and celebrated the alliance between the United States and France. But during an election year when Trump has called into question fundamental understandings about America\u2019s global role, Biden has embraced his Republican predecessor \u2014 and would-be successor \u2014 as a latent foil. Every ode to the transatlantic partnership was a reminder that Trump could upend those relationships. Each reference to democracy stood a counterpoint to his rival\u2019s efforts to overturn a presidential election. The myriad exhortations to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia created a contrast with Trump\u2019s skepticism about providing U.S. assistance. Biden\u2019s paeans to the struggle between democracy and autocracy drew plaudits in Europe, where the prospect of a return to Trump\u2019s turbulent reign has sparked no shortage of anxiety. But it remains to be seen how the message will resonate with American voters, as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to connect the dire warnings the Democratic president so often delivers about his rival with people\u2019s daily concerns. The visit to the cemetery served as a moment to underscore the contrast once more. \u201cIt\u2019s the same story,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAmerica showed up. America showed up to stop the Germans. America showed up to make sure that they did not prevail. And America shows up when we\u2019re needed just like our allies show for us.\u201d During a 2018 trip to France, Trump skipped plans to go to the cemetery, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time. However, subsequent reports said that Trump told aides he didn\u2019t want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d Trump has denied the comments, although they were later corroborated by his chief of staff at the time, John Kelly. Trump\u2019s purported insults have become a regular feature of Biden\u2019s campaign speeches, including during an April rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania. \u201cThese soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBelieving otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office.\u201d Biden ignored a direct question about Trump at the cemetery. \u201cThe idea that I would come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute,\u201d he added, his voice trailing off as if to express disbelief. Maura Sullivan, a former Marine officer who served on the American Battle Monuments Commission under President Barack Obama, said Biden\u2019s visit would \u201cset the example, and do what a president should do.\u201d Now an official with the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Sullivan said that \u201cvoters can draw their own conclusions\u201d from that. Biden\u2019s trip was full of emotional moments, and the president grew heavy-eyed after meeting with World War II veterans. A 21-gun salute cast eerie smoke over 9,388 white marble headstones at the Normandy American Cemetery. \u201cThis has been the most remarkable trip that I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Biden said on Saturday night, his last in Paris before returning to the U.S. At Aisne-Marne, Biden said the trip \u201csurprised me how much it awakened my sense of why it\u2019s so valuable to have these alliances. Why it\u2019s so critical. That\u2019s the way you stop wars, not start wars.\u201d His remarks over the last few days were also freighted with political overtones. On Thursday at Normandy anniversary ceremonies, Biden said D-Day served a reminder that alliances make the United States stronger, calling it \u201ca lesson that I pray we Americans never forget.\u201d He also highlighted how the war effort drew on immigrants, women and people of color who were too often overlooked by history. Then on Friday, he went to Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the coast where Army Rangers scaled cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses on D-Day that was also the site in 1984 of one of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s most memorable speeches about the struggles between the West and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. By following in an iconic Republican\u2019s footsteps, Biden honed his appeal to traditional conservatives who are often frustrated by Trump\u2019s isolationist vision. Biden issued a call for Americans to protect democracy like the Rangers who scaled the cliffs, a message that synced with campaign rhetoric that paints his election opponent as an existential threat to U.S. values. While Biden was in France, his campaign announced that it had hired the onetime chief of staff to former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger to lead outreach to GOP voters. Kinzinger clashed with Trump\u2019s foreign policy and efforts to overturn the last presidential election. At Pointe du Hoc, Biden said the Army Rangers \u201cfought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the \u201830s and \u201840s. Does anyone doubt they wouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?\u201d Trump has argued that the U.S. needs to devote more attention to its own problems and less to foreign alliances and entanglements. He has also routinely played down the importance of American partnerships, suggesting the U.S. could abandon its treaty commitments to defend European allies if they don\u2019t pay enough for their own defenses. Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who wrote a book about Pointe du Hoc and Reagan\u2019s speech, said Biden \u201chad big shoes to step into\u201d by choosing the same location. Biden\u2019s speech \u201cdidn\u2019t equal Reagan\u2019s in grandeur, nor could it,\u201d Brinkley said. Still, he said Biden \u201csaid the right words about why democracy matters.\u201d Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist, said it could help Biden politically \u201cto stand where Reagan stood.\u201d He noted that Biden is struggling with younger voters but appears to be gaining strength among older ones who may be more receptive to reminders of Reagan\u2019s speech four decades ago. \u201cHe needs a lot of Reagan Republicans to offset his challenges with younger voters,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s trip was also punctuated by the pomp of a state visit in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron arranged a ceremony at the Arc du Triomphe, where four fighter jets flew overhead, and hosted a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e presidential palace. \u201cUnited we stand, divided we fall,\u201d Macron said in toasting Biden. \u201cAllied we are, and allied we will stay.\u201d Overall, Biden\u2019s visit had a slower pace than other foreign trips. The 81-year-old president had no public events on his first day in Paris after arriving on an overnight flight, and didn\u2019t hold a press conference with reporters, as is customary. John Kirby, a national security spokesman, said that was necessary to prepare \u201cin advance of the weighty engagements\u201d during subsequent days. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on the calendar,\u201d he said. Still, it was a contrast to Macron\u2019s tendency to offer prestigious guests an intense schedule with a mix of official meetings, business talks, cultural events and private dinners at fancy restaurants. When the 46-year-old French leader hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, the two-day agenda was crammed with activities including a trip to the Pyrenees Mountains near the border with Spain where Macron spent time as a child.

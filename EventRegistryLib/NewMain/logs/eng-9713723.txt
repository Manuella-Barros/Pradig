Yeah, I won in the tennis part, so hopefully the Spanish team is going to win the football part.\n\n\"Yeah, I have a really good relationship with a few players of the team. In particularly, with Alvaro Morata. He's a really good friend.\n\n\"I know they are supporting me when I'm playing matches or I'm playing tournaments. It's my turn.\n\n\"Hopefully on Tuesday we are not going to play at the same time, but let's see. Hopefully I will be able to see a little bit from the match.\"\n\nAlcaraz had spent nearly four hours on court during a dramatic win over Frances Tiafoe on Friday and looked in a hurry to progress this time when he raced into a two-set lead.\n\nAfter slow starts in his previous three matches, winning first-set tie-breaks against qualifier Mark Lajal and unseeded Aleksandar Vukic before he lost the opener to Tiafoe, it was a different story this time.\n\nWith the Centre Court roof closed, Alcaraz broke in the fifth game to move one set up and Humbert had barely laid a glove on his opponent's service game by this point.\n\nThis changed midway through the second set when a marathon game saw Humbert create four break-point opportunities at 2-2, but Alcaraz dug deep to repel the Metz left-hander.\n\nBrilliant net play thwarted the final chance before Alcaraz showed the ruthlessness of a three-time grand slam champion with a break to take the set.\n\nHumbert sent a simple volley wide to gift Alcaraz the break, with the current Wimbledon champion earning the adulation of Centre Court after he twice scrambled across the baseline to return before a third slide along the grass helped force the error.\n\nHowever, Alcaraz was broken at the start of the third and two more followed, the last when Humbert sent a sweet backhand down the line.\n\nA chaotic period followed with breaks exchanged at the start of the fourth set but after Alcaraz established a 3-1 lead the world number 16 won three games in a row and was 0-40 during the eighth.\n\nHere, Alcaraz produced two aces for a huge hold and a sumptuous forehand secured another, which was followed by a decisive break.\n\nMatch point was brought up with a supreme drop shot before another ace, this time only 103mph, sent Alcaraz through.\n\nAlcaraz said: \"I had 40-love down in the fourth set.\n\n\"It was kind of I increase my tennis, increase my intensity and got the win at the end.\n\n\"Yeah, really happy that it didn't affect me at all, the third set and the problems that I had in the fourth set and I stayed really strong mentally.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"},

Reuters\n\nWimbledon's reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz was pushed to the limit for the second match in succession but once again stood firm to beat Ugo Humbert and reach the quarterfinals. Outplayed at times by his French opponent, third seed Alcaraz dug deep to triumph 6-3 6-4 1-6 7-5 to move through to the last-eight at a Grand Slam for the ninth time.\n\nJust as against American Frances Tiafoe in the previous round, Alcaraz struggled to contain an inspired opponent throwing the kitchen sink at him but this time narrowly avoided being dragged into another five-setter.\n\nThe players were protected from the torrential rain that drummed on the closed Centre Court roof early on but there was no hiding place for Humbert as Alcaraz stormed through the opening set after grabbing an early service break. Stylish left-hander Humbert began to make inroads with his early-struck returns in the second set but he went unrewarded. The warning signs had been there for Alcaraz though and he was stunned in the third set as an increasingly confident Humbert broke his serve three times in succession.\n\nAfter a flurry of service breaks at the start of the fourth set, Humbert continued to look the more dangerous and had three successive break points when Alcaraz served at 3-4 but the three-time Grand Slam champion wriggled out of danger.

I believe myself all the time.\"\n\nPaul had hoped his maiden Wimbledon quarter-final would be on Centre Court, but had to settle for its sister venue with the roof once again shut due to more wet weather.\n\nThe form of the American and his 2-2 record with Alcaraz increased the anticipation around this clash, which started with the three-time grand slam champion being unable to convert three break points.\n\nA booming forehand by Alcaraz in Paul's next service game did move him ahead, but the pattern of the match was set when the 12th seed was able to break back immediately.\n\nSoon after an extraordinary sixth game occurred, which contained four break points for Paul, nine deuces and lasted more than 18 minutes, but Alcaraz scrambled to another hold.\n\nFurther opportunities followed on each serve and when a tie-break seemed inevitable, Paul sensed his moment to land the first punch of this match-up with a powerful backhand earning a 72-minute first set.\n\nAlcaraz had made slow starts in his first three matches at the Championships and was broken five times in his fourth-round success over Ugo Humbert.\n\nAnd he continued to struggle at the start of the second set, with Paul able to win eight of the first nine points to break, with an untimely Alcaraz double fault thrown in.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard showed the response of a champion with a pair of destructive forehands helping him get the set back on serve.\n\nA first ace of the match for Alcaraz, clocked at 130mph, was backed up by two more in a row before Paul sent his forehand long in the next game to be broken to go 4-3 down.\n\nAlcaraz had flipped the momentum and another ace followed before the world number three levelled up.\n\nWith rival Sinner starring down the barrel on Centre Court, Alcaraz broke at the start of the third, but instantly relinquished the upperhand when he again dropped serve.\n\nPaul had produced an exceptionally high level during the first two sets and yet his radar started to lack direction, especially with his backhand.\n\nHe was broken again and while he pushed Alcaraz hard in the sixth game with two break points forced, the 21-year-old saved them to close out the third set.\n\nAlcaraz went up a notch again in the fourth, breaking twice before his seventh ace set up match point and it was sealed at the first time of asking after three hours and 11 minutes.",

When I'm not playing my best tennis, I'm going to try to find solutions just to be a bit better, just to beat the opponent.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 10 Jul 2024, 2:55 PM Last updated: Wed 10 Jul 2024, 3:19 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=659b8011-8f9c-5cee-ac39-1f4f9662fc76&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99265&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Sinner did impressively win the fourth set but appeared to run out of steam in the final set as Medvedev booked his spot in the final four.\n\n\"It is very tough because I could feel he wasn't moving that well,\" Medvedev said on court after his victory when asked about Sinner. \"You want to play more points to make him suffer a little bit more, and at the same time, you know at one point he is going to think he can't run anymore and will go full power and that is what he did.\n\n\"He had set points to win the third set.

I believe myself all the time.\"\n\nPaul had hoped his maiden Wimbledon quarter-final would be on Centre Court, but had to settle for its sister venue with the roof once again shut due to more wet weather.\n\nThe form of the American and his 2-2 record with Alcaraz increased the anticipation around this clash, which started with the three-time grand slam champion being unable to convert three break points.\n\nA booming forehand by Alcaraz in Paul's next service game did move him ahead, but the pattern of the match was set when the 12th seed was able to break back immediately.\n\nSoon after an extraordinary sixth game occurred, which contained four break points for Paul, nine deuces and lasted more than 18 minutes, but Alcaraz scrambled to another hold.\n\nFurther opportunities followed on each serve and when a tie-break seemed inevitable, Paul sensed his moment to land the first punch of this match-up with a powerful backhand earning a 72-minute first set.\n\nAlcaraz had made slow starts in his first three matches at the Championships and was broken five times in his fourth-round success over Ugo Humbert.\n\nAnd he continued to struggle at the start of the second set, with Paul able to win eight of the first nine points to break, with an untimely Alcaraz double fault thrown in.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard showed the response of a champion with a pair of destructive forehands helping him get the set back on serve.\n\nA first ace of the match for Alcaraz, clocked at 130mph, was backed up by two more in a row before Paul sent his forehand long in the next game to be broken to go 4-3 down.\n\nAlcaraz had flipped the momentum and another ace followed before the world number three levelled up.\n\nWith rival Sinner starring down the barrel on Centre Court, Alcaraz broke at the start of the third, but instantly relinquished the upperhand when he again dropped serve.\n\nPaul had produced an exceptionally high level during the first two sets and yet his radar started to lack direction, especially with his backhand.\n\nHe was broken again and while he pushed Alcaraz hard in the sixth game with two break points forced, the 21-year-old saved them to close out the third set.\n\nAlcaraz went up a notch again in the fourth, breaking twice before his seventh ace set up match point and it was sealed at the first time of asking after three hours and 11 minutes.",

His triumph last month at the French Open made him, at 21, the youngest man to collect a major trophy on hard, grass and clay courts.\n\nMedvedev, who is seeded No. 5 and defeated No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, won the 2021 U.S. Open but is just 1-5 in major finals.\n\nThe other match Friday will be No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his men's-record 24 Slam championships at Wimbledon, against No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti, making his debut in a major semifinal.\n\n\"Against him, you are probably more stressed, because he's probably the best player ever -- or one of the best players ever,\" said the 22-year-old Musetti, who beat Taylor Fritz in five sets on Wednesday, while Djokovic got the day off because his foe, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with an injured hip.\n\n\"You walk on court with a different mentality,\" said Musetti, whose 1-5 record against Djokovic includes a five-set loss at this year's French Open that ended at after 3 a.m. \"If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.\"\n\nAlcaraz vs. Medvedev is a rematch from last year's semifinals, when Alcaraz won in straight sets before getting past Djokovic in the final.\n\nIt also offers a contrast between a talented attacker (Alcaraz) and a consummate defender (Medvedev).\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" Alcaraz said. \"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back.\"\n\nAsked what Alcaraz's best quality is, Medvedev began this way: \"To be honest, everything.\"\n\n\"That's where it's tough to play against him, because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there. So you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can. Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it,\" said Medvedev, who has won just two of their previous six encounters.\n\n\"Carlos can do whatever, from any position,\" Medvedev said, \"and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nTommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American who lost to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, put something else on the lengthy list of the Spaniard's attributes.\n\n\"He moves unbelievably well. He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him,\" Paul said. \"Grass suits him. He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. Yeah, I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAnd then, in a nod to the sort of highlight-reel material Alcaraz regularly produces, Paul added: \"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points -- because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2024-07/710878_0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

player on the ATP Tour had managed this year.\n\nExcept in Madrid, where the Italian had to withdraw due to a hip injury before his quarter-final, the 22-year-old had advanced to every tournament he had played, and he was favoured to keep that run going despite the undoubted quality of the 2021 US Open champion.\n\nHowever, Medvedev exploited an unwell Sinner by extending rallies, even if he was forced to refocus after the top seed's extended medical timeout in the third set and a fourth-set recovery that forced a decider.\n\nNonetheless, the 28-year-old had enough in the tank to outdo his opponent and prevent a sixth straight loss in their head-to-head, going some way to exorcising the demons from his Australian Open collapse and chastening loss in Miami.\n\nNow the supreme disruptor seeks to defeat the defending champion and deny observers a possible final rematch with Novak Djokovic.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nA consecutive Wimbledon semi-final was uncertain for Alcaraz last time out, with the three-time Grand Slam champion down a set and a break before roaring back from 7-5, 2-0 down to notch the last-eight meeting with Paul 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nThat triumph ended the American's nine-match winning run on grass, which began at a successful run in Queen's in the lead-up to the Championships to make him his nation's top-ranked player.\n\nFresh off producing some of his best tennis in his Wimbledon title defence, the No. 3 seed aims to sustain those high levels against his Russian opponent.\n\nThat is easier said than done with Alcaraz, whose tendency to suffer dips in execution means another oscillating performance is expected for the French Open champion, who became the second-youngest player (21 years and 65 days) after Rafael Nadal (21 years and 33 days) in the Open Era to reach back-to-back semis at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in successive years.\n\nNow, the precocious Spaniard aims to reach another final in his career, keen to have another shot at adding to his growing collection of majors.\n\nTournament so far\n\nDaniil Medvedev:\n\nFirst round: vs. Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-3 6-4 6-2\n\nSecond round: vs. Alexandre Muller 6-7[3] 7-6[4] 6-4 7-5\n\nThird

6-1\n\nThe imminent semi-final between Medvedev and Alcaraz is not only a rematch of last year's battle but also their third match-up on the lawns of Wimbledon and seventh overall -- the Spanish player leads 4-2.\n\nEach player has a victory apiece, strikingly in straight sets, and it remains to be seen how this year's encounter plays out, with the No. 3 seed undoubtedly grown since that 2021 loss and the Russian seemingly on a mission at this year's Championships.\n\nMedvedev claimed their last Grand Slam meeting in four sets at the 2023 US Open semi-final -- ending the Spaniard's title defence in New York -- but Alcaraz has notched the next two encounters without dropping a set.\n\nWe say: Alcaraz to win in five sets\n\nMedvedev was taken to five sets for the first time at Wimbledon, unusual for the Russian, who typically plays drawn-out matches.\n\nThe outcome of Friday's semi-final depends on Alcaraz sustaining his stratospheric level for extended periods against the No. 5 seed who lives to rain on his opponents' parade.\n\nWe back Alcaraz to win this one in five, thus extending his run of claiming such matches at the Slams.\n\nID:547932:1false2false3false:QQ::

He's probably the quickest player,\" Paul said of Alcaraz. \"It's very hard to get the ball by him. Grass suits him.\n\n\"He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAlcaraz snapped Paul's nine-match grass-court winning streak, scoring his 12th straight SW19 win to set up a Wimbledon semifinal rematch with Daniil Medvedev. Alcaraz dismissed Medvedev, surrendering just nine games in the 2023 semifinal before dethroning defending champion Novak Djokovic in an epic final.\n\nThe third-seeded Alcaraz is 22-3 lifetime on lawn, including a 16-2 Wimbledon record.\n\nOne of those two losses was to Medvedev -- 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 in Alcaraz's 2021 Wimbledon debut -- the other to Jannik Sinner the next year.\n\nPaul, who owns two career wins over Alcaraz, says the Spaniard is a roll player: When Alcaraz ignites the crowd with an audacious winner it empowers his surge.\n\n\"When he starts building energy and building momentum, I don't know, it feels a little bit different than most of the other guys,\" Paul said of Alcaraz. \"He can play some seriously amazing, amazing tennis.\n\n\"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old Alcaraz is a champion for all surfaces because he adapts his game to the demands of each surface. He owns fine net skills, deploys one of the most devious drop shots in the Open Era and can vaporize his forehand to \"laser beam\" effect as Paul put it.\n\nOne of the great challenges of winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back to back is the physical adjustment to a completely different surface -- and court space.\n\nAdapting from the Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris, one of the largest Grand Slam stages in the game, to the much smaller and more intimate Centre Court can limit room to run and diminish the impact of defense and counter strikes, compared to clay.\n\nWimbledon's green lawn produces a ball bounce both faster and lower than Roland Garros' crushed red brick, which makes it trickier to time the ball.\n\nVariety is a valuable Alcaraz asset on grass in that he's applied his ability to take the ball earlier than opponents, is adept at flattening out his shots and is comfortable closing at net.\n\nAdditionally, the athletic Alcaraz puts plenty of returns back in play, squeezing safe space for opponents. Alcaraz leads Wimbledon with 30 service breaks in the tournament.\n\nThe youngest man to win Grand Slam titles on all three major surfaces, Alcaraz, who lost to Medvedev in four sets in the 2023 US Open semifinals, said he welcomes his return to Centre Court for the semifinals because he's more comfortable on Centre and believes it suits his style of play.\n\n\"I felt the difference playing on Centre Court and on Court 1. The grass is different,\" Alcaraz said. \"Obviously I feel like it was more sand on Court 1 than Centre Court. I don't want to say holes.\n\n\"There were more matches on Court 1 than Centre Court.

Medvedev has prevailed in similar circumstances this tournament but Alcaraz seems to have his number on the grandest stages.\n\nWe've reached the semifinal stage of the 2024 Wimbledon Men's singles side of the tourney, with a match featuring two players quite familiar with one another.\n\nNo. 3 Carlos Alcaraz is the heavy Wimbledon odds favorite when he meets No. 5 Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of last year's Wimbledon semifinal.\n\nJoin me as I share my reasoning as to why Alcaraz will have the upper hand in this matchup with my free betting picks for Friday, July 12\n\nWimbledon Men's Semifinal picks and predictions\n\nDaniil Medvedev vs Carlos Alcaraz match prediction\n\nSpain's Carlos Alcaraz is hoping to make history as the seventh man to successfully defend his Wimbledon title.\n\nAlcaraz hasn't been perfect during this fortnight, but he's stepped on the gas when he's needed to. Frances Tiafoe had a 2-1 set lead before Alcaraz dropped \"Big Foe\" in five while American Tommy Paul took a one-set lead with an early break in the second set before Alcaraz clocked Paul in four.\n\nAlcaraz has defeated Daniil Medvedev in four of their previous six meetings without dropping a set in each victory. Alcaraz is one of the few players on tour unfazed by the Russian's big serve. The Spaniard's ability to prolong rallies and hit winners from anywhere on the court frustrates Medvedev, and that will likely be the case on Friday.\n\nMedvedev has survived some tough battles during this fortnight, but Friday's bout with Alcaraz will be his last. Med's return game hasn't been sharp here (44% break points won) and the inconsistency of his service game (26 double faults this event) will open the door for one of the best returners in the game to fluster, and ultimately end, Medvedev's title hopes.\n\nI like Alcaraz to win, but -320 is far too juicy for my taste.\n\nMedvedev is like a wall. His movement is exceptional and his deep, penetrating groundies from both wings typically frustrate opponents.\n\nMedvedev is known as the Octopus because opponents have difficulties passing the 6-foot-5 Russian. Alcaraz is one of those rare exceptions, and his ability to go from defense to attack in the blink of an eye has frustrated Medvedev in the past, and that frustration has never been more apparent than in their last two meetings.\n\nThat's why their three meetings in Grand Slam events have all gone Under 39.5 games. Med likes to control the pace of the game and dictate points with his big serve. Alcaraz doesn't fear the Medvedev serve in the least as the Spaniard broke three times in their last meeting at Indian Wells and twice indoors at the 2023 ATP Tour finals in Turin.\n\nWe'll see some tightly contested games with the set scores determined by a service break or two. The two gladiators have never gone the distance against each other in any of their previous Grand Slam clashes or best-of-three encounters. Their one Grand Slam bout lasting more than three sets ended in four and Under 39.5 games, and Friday's clash will end Under 39.5 games as well.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/e54457fa-cf84-4784-a730-c8738ce75f7c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 659, "textEnd": 666}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, the Spaniard not only kept alive his hopes of a second straight Wimbledon title, he also showed that he shares another trait with his fellow countryman.\n\nFor a set and a bit, Tommy Paul, the American who won the title at Queen's Club last month, matched and even had the better of Alcaraz. But like those select few who have been able to live with Nadal for a while only to fall away under the weight of the physical and mental contest, the sheer effort of keeping pace with the world No 3 proved to be too much. Gaining strength with each set, Alcaraz pulled away for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory and a place in the semi-finals.\n\nAlcaraz finished with 36 winners, 19 of them on his forehand, the niggling forearm injury that dogged him for much of the first part of this year no longer a factor. Paul saved 19 of 27 break points but under the intense pressure coming from the other side, 52 forced errors and 51 unforced errors were too much to get the job done and Alcaraz moved a step closer to claiming back-to-back slams after his victory at Roland-Garros last month.\n\n\"He has been playing great tennis on grass, he won Queen's, he's been doing great stuff and today was a really difficult match for me,\" Alcaraz said. \"The first set and the beginning of the second set it was kind of like I was playing on clay, big rallies, 10 or 15 shots every rally. I had to stay strong mentally but I knew it was a really long journey and a really long match and I'm happy I was able to find the solutions.\"\n\nPaul had won two of their four meetings and went into the match high on confidence after his Queen's victory. As fast around the court as anyone on the men's Tour, the 27-year-old ran down everything and ripped winners, some of them from the most unlikely positions, including one backhand from way behind the baseline that screamed past Alcaraz at the net.\n\nAlcaraz broke first for 2-1 but Paul broke straight back and the rest of the first set was brutal, both men pulling the other all over the court, their athleticism tested to the limit. The 12th seed saved a string of break points and then snatched his chance, gaining the vital break in the 12th game to move ahead.\n\nIn his first Wimbledon quarter-final, Paul continued to give Alcaraz trouble, mixing aggression with nice touch on the drop shot. When he broke to lead 2-0 in the second set, a few murmurs started to drift around No 1 Court, some fans wondering if they were about to see the demise of the champion. They should have known better. Lifting his game right on cue, Alcaraz broke back and then broke again in the seventh game as he levelled the match.\n\nEach game continued to be lung-busting affairs, many of them going to deuce but the intensity finally began to hit Paul, his mistakes beginning to rise. After swapping early breaks, Alcaraz broke again for 2-1 and pinched a third break of the set as he took a two-sets-to-one lead.\n\nTrying to reach his second grand slam semi-final, Paul's heart was still there but his legs and body were crying out for respite. There was still time for some outstanding shots; you couldn't hit a drop volley better than Paul's at 1-1, 15-40 but his forehand broke down under the relentless pressure, two errors handing Alcaraz the break for 2-1.\n\nPaul produced a contender for shot of the day when, pushed wide outside the tramlines, he took one hand off the racket and flicked an outrageous backhand pass. But the Spaniard then produced a stunning point of his own to extend his advantage. Two games later, he did it again. Two breaks was an impossible deficit for Paul to recover and Alcaraz held to love with the help of a thunderbolt of a forehand. Shaking his head in disbelief at some more Alcaraz genius, Paul held to at least make Alcaraz serve it out, which he did.\n\nAlcaraz will now meet Daniil Medvedev in a repeat of last year's semi-final, after the Russian upset the world No 1 Jannik Sinner in five sets.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_cambers@theguardian.com", "name": "Simon Cambers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c7cf09974d3c6eb400b1c16e59105c2fddb8a1/0_320_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f086ce95ccbebf65f0da53d516b43a3a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

I thought a little bit I was on time. I wasn't.\n\n\"After I finished, I did everything in a rush just to be in time to watch a bit of Spain.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old, who is two matches away from completing the rare Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in the same year, rallied from a set down to beat Paul, No. 13 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Alcaraz has conceded four sets so far this fortnight, having taken four sets to beat 16th-seeded Frenchman Ugo Humbert in the fourth round and five sets to run down American Frances Tiafoe in the third round.\n\nDuring his recent Roland Garros title run, the 14-time tour-level titlist dropped just one set to reach the semi-finals. And last year at Wimbledon he conceded only two sets through the same stage. Winning under duress this fortnight seems to be making Alcaraz stronger.\n\n\"Well, we try just to find solutions. For me obviously it's going to be really difficult to play my best tennis every match,\" Alcaraz said. \"I know that there are going to be some matches that I'm not going to find my best tennis even though I have to try to win it.\n\n\"I think that what the big three did along their career, they are not going to play [their] best tennis. Even like that, they are going to find their good tennis just to win those matches. That's what I'm thinking.\n\n\"When I'm not playing my best tennis, I'm going to try to find solutions just to be a bit better, just to beat the opponent.\"\n\nAlcaraz next faces a rematch of last year's semi-final against Daniil Medvedev, who took out top seed and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in five sets Tuesday.

The Spaniard, who won the Indian Wells Masters 1000 and the French Open this year, has yet to express his best tennis on grass. Last year's champion suffered against Frances Tiafoe and Ugo Humbert, making numerous unforced errors and risking a shocking elimination.\n\n'Carlitos' is not serving Wimbledon well and his opponents can easily read his trajectories, responding deep and preventing him from dominating the exchanges. The former world number 1 is aware of having to raise his level to win his second Wimbledon.\n\nAlcaraz had surprised the world last year by winning the Championships, as he was not considered the main favorite on the eve of the tournament. The current world number 3 had dominated the semi-final against Daniil Medvedev, before defeating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the final.\n\nThe next opponent at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships will be Tommy Paul, who has often put him in trouble in the past. The American is expressing his best tennis on this surface and really believes he can accomplish the feat at Church Road.\n\nTommy will take the court with nothing to lose and 'Carlitos' will have to be careful to limit distractions to avoid trouble. Meanwhile, Alcaraz reached for the ninth time the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam, equaling Manuel Orantes and his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in the history of Spanish tennis.\n\n2024 was a special year for Carlos, who faced some physical problems (especially an arm injury). Despite not being at 100% form, the Spaniard managed to win the third Slam of his career at the French Open last month. Carlos Alcaraz is aware of having to improve to win his fourth Major in his career. \"I just tried to fight for every ball,\" Alcaraz explained after his match against Humbert.\n\n\"It doesn't matter which part of the court I am in, just giving myself the chance to stay alive in the point. On set point, that was a really important point for me. It didn't matter what he was going to do, I am going to be there, fighting until the last ball. Playing a lefty is always tricky. I played a lefty at Queen's and learned a bit from that match. I felt great playing today. I played at a really high level,\" Alcaraz added.\n\nDuring the press conference after his victory over Humbert, Alcaraz confessed that he did not like indoor conditions: \"I'm not used to playing indoors (on grass), I'm not going to lie, but I don't consider myself a bad indoor player,\" he said after the entire Centre Court programme on Sunday was played under the roof due to heavy rain showers in London.\n\n\"I just think that a lot of players are better than me. But honestly, I would prefer to play outdoor. That's obvious. If we have to play outdoor or indoor, I have to adapt my game with the conditions that it is. If I have to choose, I would choose outdoor.\"\n\nAlcaraz has to handle a lot of pressure in Grand Slam tournaments, but it is necessary if he wants to reach the level of legends like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. The Spaniard has repeatedly confessed to be inspired by the Big 3, who have made the history of tennis breaking many records.\n\nHis biggest opponent is definitely Jannik Sinner, who has become the world's number 1 thanks to an extraordinary progression in the last nine months. The Italian won his first Grand Slam at the Australian Open and proved several times that he could beat Alcaraz.\n\nAccording to many experts, the rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz will be the new engine of men's tennis in the next decade. Behind them are some great talents like Holger Rune, Ben Shelton, Joao Fonseca and Sebastian Korda, who have not yet found the right continuity.\n\nCarlos and Jannik could face each other in the semifinal on Friday, but they will first have to beat their opponents in the quarterfinals.\n\nDuring an interview in Wimbledon, former World No.1 Daniil Medvedev explained the differences between Alcaraz and Sinner: \"Carlos has a very big quality, like power quality. When he was 17, he could miss a lot. Now when he's in the zone he doesn't miss much and we saw it in Roland Garros.\n\nJannik [Sinner] is a bit different, but kind of the same, with a big quality of strokes. The motion is different so the way the ball coming to you is different. Even if Jannik has very big power, Carlos has even more and he managed to find it at the end of last year in Canada when he won his first Masters, he started missing less. We always knew it's tough to play him.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ferrero", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Ferrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Orantes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Orantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shelton_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shelton (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image151120.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The Spaniard has not yet expressed his best tennis in this edition of Wimbledon, accusing several laps during the matches and risking to waste too much energy.\n\nThe 3-time Grand Slam champion was dragged to the fifth set by Frances Tiafoe, while Frenchman Ugo Humbert surrendered in four sets after a hard battle. The former world number 1 has too many concentration breaks that risk him losing the matches and he himself admitted to have to improve in this respect.\n\nThe 21-year-old Spaniard shocked the world last year by winning the Wimbledon Championships, but it will be very difficult for him to repeat the extraordinary feat of 2023. 'Carlitos' is not top of the form and Jannik Sinner has grown a lot in the last period, becoming number 1 in the world and securing the status of main favorite at Church Road.\n\nThe current world number 3 will face the American Tommy Paul for a place in the semifinals, a fascinating challenge that is likely to become complicated. Should the Spaniard have any laps, Paul is ready to take advantage and reach his second Slam semi-final after the Australian Open 2023.\n\nThe declines in concentration have characterized the career of Carlos Alcaraz so far, an aspect on which he is working together with Juan Carlos Ferrero and his entire team. \"One of the things I have to change is that those disconnections happen as little as possible. In the third set, Humbert raised the level and didn't let me in, or maybe I got a little carried away by how I was playing and didn't see any space. Yes, disconnections happen to me, but not fighting the party is something else. I try to fight every ball, and whatever happens, but yes, I try to make those periods of disconnection happen as soon as possible\" - the Spaniard stated.\n\nIt's an amazing moment for Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have won this season the first two Slam trophies and now fight for the title of Wimbledon. The new generation has completely taken over the men's tour and right now only Novak Djokovic can take up the 'old guard' and compete for very important goals. The Italian and the Spaniard have reached a record that has occurred even once throughout the Open Era: the two rivals Under 23, despite being rivals within the playing field, won at least the quarter-finals in the first three seasonal Slam events in the same calendar year. Pete Sampras and Jim Courier did it in 1993.\n\nAt the 2024 French Open Sinner and Alcaraz faced each other in the semifinal, giving rise to another wonderful battle of 5 sets: Carlitos prevailed, who then won the final title. The same scenario could be recorded at Wimbledon, with the two placed in the same part of the draw: in the event of both wins on Tuesday afternoon, they would find themselves facing each other.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could face each other in the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Championships, a challenge that would be highly anticipated by both fans and experts. The Spaniard and the Italian will also have to pay attention to the growth of Novak Djokovic, who is increasing his level as the days go by. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has clearly beaten Holger Rune in the last 16 without ever giving the impression of being in trouble. After having surgery on his right knee, Nole is recovering the best form and will have a simpler draw than Alcaraz and Sinner. The former world number 1 can boast more experience on grass than the two young rivals, who need to play further matches on this surface.\n\n'Carlitos' also confessed that he does not like to play under the roof, as his indoor results show. \"I'm not used to playing indoors, I'm not going to lie. But I don't consider myself a bad player indoors. I just think that are a lot of players better than me,\" Alcaraz explained. \"I would prefer to play outdoors. But if the weather is OK and the suns out. Not if it is windy. But if we have to play outdoors or indoors, I have to adapt my game with the conditions that it is.\"\n\nAlcaraz is focused on the 2024 Wimbledon Championships, but he will support Spain at Euro 2024.

His triumph last month at the French Open made him, at 21, the youngest man to collect a major trophy on hard, grass and clay courts.\n\nMedvedev, who is seeded No. 5 and defeated No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, won the 2021 U.S. Open but is just 1-5 in major finals.\n\nThe other match Friday will be No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his men's-record 24 Slam championships at Wimbledon, against No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti, making his debut in a major semifinal.\n\n\"Against him, you are probably more stressed, because he's probably the best player ever -- or one of the best players ever,\" said the 22-year-old Musetti, who beat Taylor Fritz in five sets on Wednesday, while Djokovic got the day off because his foe, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with an injured hip.\n\n\"You walk on court with a different mentality,\" said Musetti, whose 1-5 record against Djokovic includes a five-set loss at this year's French Open that ended at after 3 a.m. \"If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.\"\n\nAlcaraz vs. Medvedev is a rematch from last year's semifinals, when Alcaraz won in straight sets before getting past Djokovic in the final.\n\nIt also offers a contrast between a talented attacker (Alcaraz) and a consummate defender (Medvedev).\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" Alcaraz said. \"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back.\"\n\nAsked what Alcaraz's best quality is, Medvedev began this way: \"To be honest, everything.\"\n\nThat sounds like an exaggeration.\n\nMight not be.\n\n\"That's where it's tough to play against him, because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there. So you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can. Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it,\" said Medvedev, who has won just two of their previous six encounters.\n\n\"Carlos can do whatever, from any position,\" Medvedev said, \"and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nTommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American who lost to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, put something else on the lengthy list of the Spaniard's attributes.\n\n\"He moves unbelievably well. He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him,\" Paul said. \"Grass suits him. He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. Yeah, I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAnd then, in a nod to the sort of highlight-reel material Alcaraz regularly produces, Paul added: \"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points -- because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

Despite losing the first set, the Spaniard rallied to win 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2, setting up a clash with the Russian Daniil Medvedev on Friday.\n\nPaul, riding a wave of nine consecutive victories, initially proved to be a formidable opponent. The American pushed Alcaraz to his limits, breaking his serve three times within the first hour and a quarter. However, Alcaraz fought back and managed to stay in the game despite the early setbacks.\n\nThis determination helped him bounce back from a set and two games down to turn the match in his favour. Paul, despite his strong start, struggled to maintain his level of play, while Alcaraz displayed moments of brilliance that disrupted the American's game plan and secured his victory.\n\nHis performance improved steadily, peaking in the third set where he played some of his best tennis of the tournament.\n\nVictory was then sealed in the fourth set, as Alcaraz quickly broke Paul's serve. With powerful baseline shots and strategic net play, he kept Paul on the defensive to seal the win.\n\nAs Alcaraz moves into the semi-finals, he remains confident. \"I can have lapses, but not fighting is another thing. In Grand Slams, I have five sets to recover. I always believe I can come back,\" he said.\n\nAlcaraz's next challenge will be Daniil Medvedev, who defeated Jannik Sinner in a gruelling five-set match. The Russian player, who Alcaraz defeated in last year's semi-finals, will be looking for revenge.

First things first, though: Alcaraz has to fight his way through Tommy Paul.\n\nThe verdict on Alcaraz through four match wins at Wimbledon this year is that he is getting the job done but is not fooling anyone. He has been erratic. He has not played with maximum intensity or flawless consistency. Alcaraz has played at least one very spotty set, if not two, in each match he has played. He has gone through a lot of ups and downs. He has rescued himself each time he has struggled, but he has struggled several times and has not had a clean, dominant match yet in this fortnight. Did the French Open take a lot out of him? Is he not as hungry for this Wimbledon title since he won here a year ago? Is he distracted by the fact that the Paris Summer Olympics are just around the corner in a few weeks? All of that is speculation, but there are bread crumbs of logic which tell you that there are reasons Alcaraz isn't maxing out and playing his absolute best tennis. We're all wondering if Alcaraz will finally put forth his best stuff, now that the Sinner semifinal and a run at the Wimbledon title are coming into focus.\n\nTime: Approx. 10 a.m. ET / 7 a.m. PT -- match could start 45 minutes earlier or later depending on length of previous match\n\nAlcaraz hasn't consistently covered spreads at this Wimbledon tournament, but one gets the sense that he has conserved energy in Week 1 and that he is saving up for Week 2. If that is true, we're about to see Alcaraz significantly raise his level of play. Assuming he does, he can take off in this match and give Tommy Paul a thrashing. Alcaraz can smell the title now. He knows he needs to enter a possible Sinner semifinal in good form. He will sharpen up and polish his game here against Paul.\n\nWhy Tommy Paul Could Cover The Spread\n\nAlcaraz remains erratic. He has not covered the spread in three of his four Wimbledon matches thus far. Paul is a solid top-20 player. He should be able to keep this match close enough to cover.\n\nFinal Carlos Alcaraz-Tommy Paul Prediction & Pick\n\nWe have continued to be wrong about Alcaraz. Now we think Paul is going to cover ... but our official recommendation, again, is to pass on Alcaraz matches.

Big rallies, 10 to 15 shots every point,\" Alcaraz said in his on-court interview afterwards. \"So I had to stay strong mentally when I lost the first set.\n\n\"It was difficult for me a little bit, but I knew it was a long journey, a long match, and I just had to stay there. I'm really happy to find the solutions and the good path.\"\n\nAlcaraz will play No. 5 seed Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals, in what is a rematch of their semifinal clash from last year's tournament.\n\nPaul had been in excellent grass-court form having won at Queen's - a Wimbledon warm-up tournament - and his quarterfinals appearance in SW19 was the furthest he'd reached at the grand slam.\n\nThe 27-year-old continued his impressive play on Tuesday against Alcaraz, winning the first set and holding a 2-0 lead in the second.\n\nBut the Spaniard eventually found his range, in particular against Paul's serve. The 21-year-old broke his American opponent seven times across the final three sets of the match to provide himself the opportunity to build a lead.\n\nAfter three hours and 11 minutes, the three-time grand slam champion was able to wrap up a victory which sees him into the semifinals for the second successive year.\n\n\"I believe that I can come back,\" said Alcaraz, when asked how he works through difficult moments on court. \"If I am struggling a little bit, I try to find the solutions if the opponent is playing great tennis. I believe that, at the end, I will be able to come back and find solutions, the good rhythm.\n\n\"Today's match is an example. Even here at the grand slams, where the matches are longer, I have more time to come back, so I believe in myself the whole time.\"\n\nMedvedev awaits for Alcaraz in the semifinals after the Russian beat world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller on Centre Court on Tuesday.\n\nSinner won the opening set, but the Italian was hampered by an illness early in the second set, calling a medical timeout in which he had his pulse checked by doctors and went off court to be further evaluated.\n\nWhen he returned, Medvedev looked a player renewed as he won the next two sets. Sinner did impressively win the fourth set but appeared to run out of steam in the final set as Medvedev booked his spot in the final four.\n\n\"It is very tough because I could feel he wasn't moving that well,\" Medvedev said on court after his victory when asked about Sinner. \"You want to play more points to make him suffer a little bit more, and at the same time, you know at one point he is going to think he can't run anymore and will go full power and that is what he did.\n\n\"He had set points to win the third set. In a way, I would have preferred to not have this situation but everything turned out well.\"\n\nWhen Alcaraz and Medvedev played in last year's semifinal, the Spaniard dropped just nine games to ease into his debut Wimbledon final; Alcaraz won his maiden Wimbledon title by beating Novak Djokovic in a gripping five-set clash.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

and just the second major quarter-final of his career.\n\nIt has not always been easy for Paul, but he was in cruise control against Roberto Bautista Agut in round four and now faces another Spaniard: reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nWorld No 3 Alcaraz is more experienced at this level and is the favourite, but Paul has had some success against the three-time major champion before.\n\nThe American holds a level 2-2 head-to-head against Alcaraz, causing the Spaniard more trouble than most.\n\nPaul is more than capable of beating Alcaraz again - here is how he can do it.\n\nAlcaraz cruised through his opening two matches, but his round three and four matches - against 29th seed Frances Tiafoe, and 16th seed Ugo Humbert - were far from straightforward.\n\nTiafoe pushed the reigning champion to five sets and was six points from victory at one stage, while Humbert nearly forced a decider after a dominant third set.\n\nWhat was most notable in both matches is that Alcaraz looked vulnerable on serve, broken four times in a row by Humbert at one stage, and also facing issues against Tiafoe.\n\nWith neither of those opponents renowned for being the best returners on tour, this suggests Alcaraz may be vulnerable.\n\nPaul is not a massive returner but it is a reliable part of his game, and he must look to be ultra-aggressive whenever possible.\n\nWhether it is stepping inside the baseline for any second serve or holding a high line on every first serve, the world No 13 can make the Spaniard uncomfortable in this area.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz crowned Wimbledon champion, Novak Djokovic out early - Week 2 predictions\n\nCarlos Alcaraz makes revealing Centre Court confession as he marches on at Wimbledon\n\nThis may seem like an obvious point to through in, but is a particularly key area for both men in this match-up.\n\nPaul is rock solid on the baseline and it is undoubtedly his all-round consistency and reliability off both wings, and with his athleticism, that has caused Alcaraz so many problems in this match-up previously.\n\nThe world No 3 is so used to being able to dictate play and bully opponents around the court, usually to success - but the American does not make this an easy thing to do against him.\n\nPaul will have to defend regularly in this encounter but that is no issue for him, and he has proven regularly in recent months he is comfortable switching from defence to attack.\n\nA clean, level game gives him a huge shot against an opponent with such wild ups and downs.\n\nAlcaraz has several big strengths, and one of them is undoubtedly getting the crowd on his side.\n\nHe has become a hugely popular figure with fans thanks to his exciting brand of tennis, and produces big shots in big moments to raise the roof off any court he is playing on.\n\nOften, this unnerves his opponents, causing them to crumble slightly or lose focus - something Paul cannot afford to do.\n\nThe American will probably need to accept that he will not be the crowd favourite here, and ignore the 15,000 out on Centre Court to focus solely on himself.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Bautista Agut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F08113921%2FAlcaraz-Paul.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Instead, they produced the best set of tennis at Wimbledon this year as part of their own three-hour, 11-minute epic.\n\nAlcaraz eventually ran out winner 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 and looks well on course to retain the title he won 12 months ago, especially with world number one and likely challenger Sinner on his way back to Italy.\n\nYet the score does not tell the story of a remarkable match in which the number 3 was pushed to his limits and consistently produced the most spectacular answers. That he knocked his defeated opponent off the court at the end of the match gives some idea of what the pair had been through together.\n\nAfter a five-set win over Frances Tiafoe, coming just a tiebreak away from crashing out, and a tough four-set victory over Ugo Humbert in his previous two matches, Alcaraz will have to work harder than many expected to defend his title.\n\nBut the things we want most are rarely easy to come by, and to join the illustrious list of five (Laver, Borg, Nadal, Federer, Djokovic) who won the men's singles title at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year, it's only right that he truly deserves it. And boy, did he earn it today.\n\nIn an exciting match, it was the first set that will be remembered for a long time. An hour and 12 minutes of brilliant tennis that thrilled the crowd at Court 1, astonished by the athleticism, strength and ingenuity of both men. It was as pure a match of clean, flat hitting as this famous old court has ever seen.\n\nIf for some reason Paul had forgotten the magnitude of the challenge that awaited him against the reigning champion, Alcaraz needed only one game to remind him. The Spaniard flew from the blocks, earning four break points in a game that, at seven minutes long, seemed remarkable but proved to be just a taste of what was to come.\n\nPaul did everything he could to save all four balls and in his second service game he also saved a fifth. Only on the sixth service did he succumb to the constant flood when Alcaraz found the ball on the line with a sublime forehand winner.\n\nAlcaraz was already in full swing, combining baseline power-hitting with the guile of his patented drop shots and deft hands at the net. But when He Paul needed a reminder of the challenge he faced against the man who won Queens last month, but in the fourth game it was Paul who did it, breaking back immediately with a barely believable backhand down the line to score a clear winner.\n\nFrom there, the opening set reached a crescendo and the sixth game, with Alcaraz serving at 2-3, will likely go down in history as the best single game at this year's championship. Paul gave the champion a taste of his own medicine with a disguised drop shot followed by a passing shot winner to earn one of four break points, but the fact that his own weapon was used against him only served to anger the Spaniard further. On the next point, he did the same by hitting a drop shot from the back of the court that the American would likely not have been able to reach even if he hadn't slipped after being fooled.\n\nAfter a ridiculous nine deuces, the third-seeded player finally managed to secure victory and he roared as loudly as he had ever done on the grass courts of Wimbledon: a VAMOS, as the crowd roared back their approval.\n\nThat marathon made the first six games of the match last 40 minutes alone, but the real drama of the set was yet to come. Just when it looked like a tiebreak, the underdog grunted and secured a 7-5 victory with a timely break of service, sealed by a remarkable passing shot down the line on the run.\n\nAfter 72 minutes of tennis at the highest level possible, Paul had the most difficult set to win on the scoreboard. But the beauty of a men's Grand Slam tournament is that he was still only a third of the way to a place in the semi-finals.\n\nMany would have been devastated by the manner of his opening salvo and, perhaps understandably, Alcaraz still looked shell-shocked at the start of the second set, promptly losing serve with a routine forehand wide after having double-faulted earlier in the game. But like all true champions, the No. 3 seed dug deep, refocused and slowly began to impose his will on the quarter-final.\n\nThe feeling that the 21-year-old of the pair had the best chance of maintaining the superhuman level they had both shown in the first set ultimately proved correct. He immediately took back the break and, as if to prove that scoring highlights after long rallies is not the only way he can win points, opened another service game with three straight aces before settling it with an unreturned second serve.\n\nWhen Paul faltered a bit, Alcaraz punished him again halfway through the second set with a break in his serve. The American made two double faults and used that advantage to win 6-4.\n\nThe third set was even more brutal. Paul still showed flashes of the inspired player of those first 72 minutes with sliding volley winners and crushed forehands, but could not string points together in the same way. When a couple of break-back points at 3-2 disappeared, Alcaraz promptly confirmed a double break en route to a 6-2 triumph.\n\nSnorting at the finish line, last year's champion went for the throat. An early break in the fourth set sent the 12 seed shuffled back to his seat dejectedly and when Paul's forehand went wide to confirm a double break at 4-1, the match was over. A 6-2 victory sealed the win as both players embraced at the net and Alcaraz proceeded to thrash his beaten opponent.

The former World number 1 has struggled to defeat Frances Tiafoe and Ugo Humbert, proving that he is not yet at the top of the condition. The 2023 Wimbledon champion - who beat Novak Djokovic in the last year final - had too many ups and downs in the last matches but managed to win thanks to his enormous talent.\n\nThe three-time Grand Slam champion will need more continuity if he is to win his second Championships title and the fourth Major of his young career. 'Carlitos' struggled at the start of the season due to a series of injuries, which forced him to miss the Masters 1000 in Montecarlo and the Masters 1000 in Rome. Despite the pain, Alcaraz recovered in the spring winning the Indian Wells Masters 1000 and especially the French Open last month.\n\nThe Spaniard will face Tommy Paul for a place in the semifinals at Wimbledon. The American plays excellent tennis on grass and has already won at the Queen's Club this year, beating Lorenzo Musetti in the final. In addition, Tommy has already proven that he can beat Alcaraz thanks to his powerful and aggressive tennis.\n\nEveryone hopes that Carlos Alcaraz will face his great rival Jannik Sinner in the semifinals at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships. The Spaniard and the Italian have always played beautiful matches, proving that their rivalry will be the focus of men's tennis in the coming years. 'Carlitos' managed to beat the current World number 1 this year at Indian Wells and the French Open.\n\nIn order to reach the semifinals, Alcaraz will have to eliminate those empty passages he was the victim of in the last matches. The Spaniard is working very hard on this aspect together with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, but it takes further time to reach full maturity.\n\nDespite the difficulties of the last days, Alcaraz analyzed with satisfaction his performance: \"I am happy to have reached the quarter-finals in London and I seem to improve every game I play. I tried to keep my concentration high throughout the match, even though I made several mistakes in the third and fourth sets. It wasn't easy, because Ugo started playing better and better. There was a time when I could not serve well, I had the feeling that he was reading my trajectories and it was difficult to find solutions. In the decisive moment of the fourth set, I increased my intensity and remained mentally strong.\"\n\nCarlos will need to play 100% if he wants to beat Tommy Paul, who is in top form. The American defeated Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in three sets. \"I always had fun when I faced Alcaraz and I hope to do well this time too\" - said Paul during the press conference. I will probably have the chance to play on the Centre Court, which is the most iconic court in the history of tennis. I don't think the schedule has been published yet, but it doesn't make much difference to me. I'll also be ready to play on Court No.1\" - he added.\n\nAlcaraz is considered by the bookmakers the second favorite for the victory at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships behind Jannik Sinner, who defeated in three sets Ben Shelton on Court 1. The Italian does not have the game peaks of Carlos, but his more continuous performance allowed him to become the World number 1 this year and win the Australian Open in early 2024.\n\nThe goal of the Spaniard is to return to the top as soon as possible and a victory at Wimbledon would certify his status as the strongest in the world.\n\nAbout this topic, tennis legend Boris Becker explained the difference between Alcaraz and Sinner. \"Jannik has been playing at a very high level for many months and consistency is his best quality. He did not play bad matches in the last match and lost very few games. Alcaraz grazes perfection when he plays at his best, but sometimes his performance is a little fluctuating. From Sinner you know what to expect, while Carlos has moments of sharp decline that can make a difference.\"\n\nDespite being still very young, Alcaraz has already broken several records and aims to become one of the best players ever. The former world number 1 has the talent to reach legends like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, but he needs a further mental step to fill the gap. The rivalry with Sinner will certainly help him in his purpose, as he himself admitted on more than one occasion. Tommy Paul will be a huge test at the Wimbledon Championships to see if Carlitos can really repeat the title won at Church Road last year.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ferrero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Ferrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shelton_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shelton (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Bautista Agut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Becker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boris Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image150947.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The Spanish champion - after losing the first set against Tommy Paul in the last 16 - has raised his level expressing his best tennis in the next three sets.\n\nHis next opponent will not be Jannik Sinner, because the Italian was beaten by Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals. The Russian will try to take revenge in London after losing last year's semi-final against the Spaniard, who won the title by beating Novak Djokovic in the final.\n\nCarlitos' season has improved since spring, with victories in the Indian Wells Masters 1000 and especially at the French Open last month. Alcaraz already has three majors on its board, plus 5 Masters 1000 and several other prestigious titles. His level is increasing with the passing days and he is the favorite to reach the final at Church Road along with the seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. The Serbian will face the Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the other semi-final scheduled on the Centre Court.\n\nIn a long interview reported by the ATP website, Juan Carlos Ferrero talked about Carlos Alcaraz's condition: \"He's feeling very good. He's grown into it against tough players. [Frances] Tiafoe and [Tommy] Paul are difficult. He feels good and he's managed to solve the problems that he's faced, but now we're very focused on the match with Medvedev, not thinking about the title. We can't think much beyond Friday because that would be a mistake. Medvedev has earned the respect of all the players. So we're approaching it with the utmost concern.\"\n\nFerrero added: \"Nothing is a given, Marc M\u00e1rquez is a perfect example. What happened to him... he was winning everything, he got an injury and now he hasn't won for over 1,000 days. He's battling to come back now, a guy who is an absolute one-off. Problems can happen, you [can't] be too confident, you have to keep working. I think people have got used to him being up there, perhaps what he's doing is even underappreciated.\"\n\nJuan Carlos also reflected on Jannik Sinner's shocking defeat against Medvedev: \"Medvedev has earned respect. He beat Sinner, who we thought was almost unbeatable on the grass for his style of play. It is true that Carlos plays differently from Jannik and can do a little more harm to his playing style. We are focused to the maximum and with the maximum precautions. We beat Daniil here last year, but then he beat us in the US Open semi-final. The fact that defeats don't affect him and help him improve says a lot about him. I'm sure he'll feel something different on Friday.\"\n\nCarlos Alcaraz certainly has more weapons than Jannik Sinner, such as background variations and masterful use of dropshot. After Medvedev's victory over Alcaraz in the 2023 US Open semi-final, the Spaniard took revenge in the 2024 Indian Wells final.\n\nThe 21-year-old Spaniard has overcome some physical problems that had tormented him in recent months preventing him from playing his best tennis and making him skip the tournaments of Monte Carlo and Rome. Carlos had a lot of laps in the early rounds of the 2024 Wimbledon Championships, but now he seems ready for the title.\n\nAlcaraz played his quarterfinal match against Tommy Paul on Court No.1, which is different from the legendary Centre Court. \"I felt the difference playing on Centre Court and on Court One. The grass is different,\" Alcaraz stated. \"Obviously I feel like it was more sand on Court One than Centre Court. I don't want to say holes.\n\nThere were more matches on Court One than Centre Court, I had to adapt my game on that. I know that there are going to be some matches that I'm not going to find my best tennis even though I have to try to win it. That's what I'm thinking. When I'm not playing my best tennis, I'm going to try to find solutions just to be a bit better, just to beat the opponent.\"\n\nCarlos Alcaraz is the main favourite for the title according to the bookmakers, followed by seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. Very distant Daniil Medvedev and Lorenzo Musetti, huge revelation of the tournament thanks to a smooth draw. The Spaniard wants to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, a feat that would be exceptional at just 21 and that would allow him to make the history of this sport.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ferrero", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Ferrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image150980.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

I know he is in a very good shape, so I have to do my best, believe in myself and try to keep going if I want to beat him.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Court_(Wimbledon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/v2nacl1g_ss_625x300_10_July_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

His triumph last month at the French Open made him, at 21, the youngest man to collect a major trophy on hard, grass and clay courts.\n\nMedvedev, who is seeded No. 5 and defeated No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, won the 2021 U.S. Open but is just 1-5 in major finals.\n\nThe other match Friday will be No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his men's-record 24 Slam championships at Wimbledon, against No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti, making his debut in a major semifinal.\n\n\"Against him, you are probably more stressed, because he's probably the best player ever -- or one of the best players ever,\" said the 22-year-old Musetti, who beat Taylor Fritz in five sets on Wednesday, while Djokovic got the day off because his foe, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with an injured hip.\n\n\"You walk on court with a different mentality,\" said Musetti, whose 1-5 record against Djokovic includes a five-set loss at this year's French Open that ended at after 3 a.m. \"If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.\"\n\nAlcaraz vs. Medvedev is a rematch from last year's semifinals, when Alcaraz won in straight sets before getting past Djokovic in the final.\n\nIt also offers a contrast between a talented attacker (Alcaraz) and a consummate defender (Medvedev).\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" Alcaraz said. \"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back.\"\n\nAsked what Alcaraz's best quality is, Medvedev began this way: \"To be honest, everything.\"\n\nThat sounds like an exaggeration.\n\nMight not be.\n\n\"That's where it's tough to play against him, because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there. So you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can. Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it,\" said Medvedev, who has won just two of their previous six encounters.\n\n\"Carlos can do whatever, from any position,\" Medvedev said, \"and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nTommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American who lost to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, put something else on the lengthy list of the Spaniard's attributes.\n\n\"He moves unbelievably well. He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him,\" Paul said. \"Grass suits him. He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. Yeah, I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAnd then, in a nod to the sort of highlight-reel material Alcaraz regularly produces, Paul added: \"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points -- because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

I was ready, I missed a shot. I was 5-6 down. Some momentum change, a small one, but I could lose the third set and then everything can happen in fourth and fifth potentially.\n\n\"I'm happy how I handled the situation.

The duo passed the test -- not quite with flying colours, but good enough to keep the capacity crowd riveted -- before Alcaraz came through 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5.\n\nOn Sunday, the Centre Court alternatively shimmered under the sunlight that the translucent roof allowed and trembled when thunderous rain badgered the canopy. The tennis mimicked it. Alcaraz drifted in and out of the contest, in line with his recent form, and so did Humbert, who was in the fourth round for the first time since his debut performance in 2019.\n\nThe two spent the first four games sizing up each other, with Humbert attempting to dictate with his serve and Alcaraz trying to slice and dice his way through. The Spaniard stepped it up midway, breaking Humbert to 3-2, and came back from 0-30 down to hold to 4-2. Another break in the ninth game, courtesy a splendid backhand winner and an inch-perfect inside-out forehand, gave Alcaraz the set 6-3.\n\nThe second stanza was as up and down. Alcaraz managed to erase four break-point opportunities in the fifth game before breaking Humbert in the 10th to take a 2-0 lead. The set-point was particularly vivid, for Alcaraz ran everything down and even did a split to retrieve a ball. It broke Humbert's resolve as he sent an easy volley out.\n\nHumbert took a time-out and by the time he stepped back on to the court, Alcaraz was ready to serve. But the 21-year-old soon realised that such urgency was misplaced. Humbert, who has a big grass-court title to his name (Halle, 2021), showcased his full repertoire -- with the one-two punch and the immaculate drop volley standing out -- to take the set 6-1.\n\nIn the fourth, both players were nervous wrecks, trading breaks twice in the first six games. At 3-4, Humbert had Alcaraz at 0-40 but let it slip again. At 5-5, Alcaraz made the play with a drop-shot winner and a fine forehand. Humbert wilted, dumping an easy smash long and misjudging an Alcaraz forehand to get broken. A clean hold from the three-time Slam winner that concluded with a vicious sliding service winner brought the curtain down.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Monday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manic Monday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_(Saale)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halle (Saale)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Halle (Saale)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hrsmn0/article68380797.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_Wimbledon_2_1_HUD1BS3J.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It was a long journey for me, it was a long match so I was happy to find the solutions (to win).\"\n\nWith Spain taking on France in the Euro 2024 semifinals later on Tuesday, diehard football fan Alcaraz was probably hoping that he would be back in Wimbledon's plush locker room in double quick time, having extended his perfect Grand Slam record against Americans to 7-0.\n\nIt was not long before Paul provided him with a harsh reality check.\n\nAlcaraz earned four break points in the opening game, including a pulsating 14-shot rally which he capped by smashing the ball away with his back almost turned to the net. Yet all four of those opportunities went begging.\n\nThe third seed was kept on his toes for 17 captivating minutes as he was forced to save four break points, while being stretched to nine deuces, before he finally managed to hold serve on his sixth game point - and all this effort just to get to 3-3 in the first set.\n\nIt was no wonder he was shouting \"Vamos\" and raised a left-arm salute as the crowd jumped to their feet to give both players a standing ovation.\n\nBut Paul kept producing the delicious dropshots, ferocious forehands and luscious lobs to make life uncomfortable for the Spaniard.\n\nAs he drilled a backhand down the line winner past Alcaraz's outstretched racket to seal the first set and then broke for a 2-0 lead, he kept drawing roars of approval from the Court One crowd.\n\nBut just when he might have started dreaming that he might finally become the first American man to reach the semifinal at Wimbledon since John Isner in 2018, Alcaraz said enough was enough and quickly got to work to douse the fireworks.\n\nPaul managed to save 19 break points. But unfortunately for him he dropped serve eight times which was enough for an all-court tactician like Alcaraz, who has won majors on three different surfaces, to seal victory.\n\n\"He can play some seriously amazing, amazing tennis. Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll,\" Paul said.\n\nAfter being kept on court for just over three hours, the Spanish third seed won his 12th match in a row at the grasscourt major when Paul swiped the ball wide.\n\n\"I (always) believe I can come back, even if I am struggling or am in trouble. I believe I can find the solutions even if the opponent is playing great tennis. I believe in myself all the time,\" added Alcaraz, who will next meet 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of last year's semifinal. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_payo@rappler.com", "name": "Jasmine Payo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lob (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/07/reuters-carlos-alcaraz-tommy-paul-july-10-2024-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 330, "textEnd": 336}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Friday's match will be their fifth since March 2023, and only once in that span has Medvedev come out on top (a four-setter at the 2023 US Open).

No opponent is better suited to frustrate the temperamental Russian. Alcaraz's court coverage is unparalleled on tour these days and, unlike most other fleet-footed ATPers, he pairs his speed with a dominant serve and massive ground strokes.\n\nI firmly believe Alcaraz will get back to world #1 in the not-too-distant future and, barring injuries, stay there for a long while.

His triumph last month at the French Open made him, at 21, the youngest man to collect a major trophy on hard, grass and clay courts.\n\nMedvedev, who is seeded No. 5 and defeated No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, won the 2021 U.S. Open but is just 1-5 in major finals.\n\nThe other match Friday will be No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his men's-record 24 Slam championships at Wimbledon, against No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti, making his debut in a major semifinal.\n\n\"Against him, you are probably more stressed, because he's probably the best player ever -- or one of the best players ever,\" said the 22-year-old Musetti, who beat Taylor Fritz in five sets on Wednesday, while Djokovic got the day off because his foe, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with an injured hip.\n\n\"You walk on court with a different mentality,\" said Musetti, whose 1-5 record against Djokovic includes a five-set loss at this year's French Open that ended at after 3 a.m. \"If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.\"\n\nAlcaraz vs. Medvedev is a rematch from last year's semifinals, when Alcaraz won in straight sets before getting past Djokovic in the final.\n\nIt also offers a contrast between a talented attacker (Alcaraz) and a consummate defender (Medvedev).\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" Alcaraz said. \"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back.\"\n\nAsked what Alcaraz's best quality is, Medvedev began this way: \"To be honest, everything.\"\n\n\"That's where it's tough to play against him, because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there. So you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can. Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it,\" said Medvedev, who has won just two of their previous six encounters.\n\n\"Carlos can do whatever, from any position,\" Medvedev said, \"and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nTommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American who lost to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, put something else on the lengthy list of the Spaniard's attributes.\n\n\"He moves unbelievably well. He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him,\" Paul said. \"Grass suits him. He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. Yeah, I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAnd then, in a nod to the sort of highlight-reel material Alcaraz regularly produces, Paul added: \"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points -- because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

Sinner prevailed in four sets when the duo met in the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2022.\n\nIn an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, Becker hailed Sinner's form this year and explained why he gives the 22-year-old the edge over Alcaraz.\n\n\"I think Sinner is on the right track,\" said the German. \"He has been playing at a very high level for months now, and his greatest quality is consistency. If we focus on the last period, he hasn't played a 'bad match' yet, touching wood.\n\n\"On the one hand, you can't always win, but on the other, he always has a very high level, more than anyone else since the beginning of the year. So to surpass him, you have to do even better and that's why this year he has only lost a couple of matches.\n\n\"We all have weaknesses, even Alcaraz! Jokes aside, on the court he is close to perfection, but sometimes he is a bit inconsistent in form, while Sinner is more consistent.\n\n\"When you see a match by Jannik today, you know exactly what to expect, not with Carlos. At the moment, the Italian is mentally solid and this shows on the court.\"\n\nThe former world No 1 also argued that Sinner's hard-fought second round victory over compatriot and former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini sharpened him for the tournament.\n\n\"There is the eternal debate about 'good' or 'bad' draws, to me, as a player and then as a coach, it has always seemed like a sterile discussion, it is the player who makes the draw a good draw,\" Becker added.\n\n\"Personally, I have always preferred to start with tougher opponents, because it prepared me mentally for the second week.

His triumph last month at the French Open made him, at 21, the youngest man to collect a major trophy on hard, grass and clay courts.\n\nMedvedev, who is seeded No. 5 and defeated No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, won the 2021 U.S. Open but is just 1-5 in major finals.\n\nThe other match Friday will be No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his men's-record 24 Slam championships at Wimbledon, against No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti, making his debut in a major semifinal.\n\n\"Against him, you are probably more stressed, because he's probably the best player ever -- or one of the best players ever,\" said the 22-year-old Musetti, who beat Taylor Fritz in five sets on Wednesday, while Djokovic got the day off because his foe, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with an injured hip.\n\n\"You walk on court with a different mentality,\" said Musetti, whose 1-5 record against Djokovic includes a five-set loss at this year's French Open that ended at after 3 a.m. \"If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.\"\n\nAlcaraz vs. Medvedev is a rematch from last year's semifinals, when Alcaraz won in straight sets before getting past Djokovic in the final.\n\nIt also offers a contrast between a talented attacker (Alcaraz) and a consummate defender (Medvedev).\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" Alcaraz said. \"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back.\"\n\nAsked what Alcaraz's best quality is, Medvedev began this way: \"To be honest, everything.\"\n\n\"That's where it's tough to play against him, because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there. So you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can. Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it,\" said Medvedev, who has won just two of their previous six encounters.\n\n\"Carlos can do whatever, from any position,\" Medvedev said, \"and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nTommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American who lost to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, put something else on the lengthy list of the Spaniard's attributes.\n\n\"He moves unbelievably well. He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him,\" Paul said. \"Grass suits him. He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. Yeah, I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAnd then, in a nod to the sort of highlight-reel material Alcaraz regularly produces, Paul added: \"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points -- because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/7cc5c80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5247x2951+0+273/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6f%2F73%2Ffdc3a0f630084dd7ac878d8281e8%2F427d9f6c20684828ba07815001c70621", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

It was a long journey for me, it was a long match so I was happy to find the solutions (to win).\"\n\nWith Spain taking on France in the Euro 2024 semi-finals later on Tuesday, diehard football fan Alcaraz was probably hoping that he would be back in Wimbledon's plush locker room in double quick time, having extended his perfect Grand Slam record against Americans to 7-0.\n\nSTANDING OVATION\n\nIt was not long before Paul provided him with a harsh reality check.\n\nAlcaraz earned four break points in the opening game, including a pulsating 14-shot rally which he capped by smashing the ball away with his back almost turned to the net. Yet all four of those opportunities went begging.\n\nThe third seed was kept on his toes for 17 captivating minutes as he was forced to save four break points, while being stretched to nine deuces, before he finally managed to hold serve on his sixth game point - and all this effort just to get to 3-3 in the first set.\n\nIt was no wonder he was shouting \"Vamos\" and raised a left-arm salute as the crowd jumped to their feet to give both players a standing ovation.\n\nBut Paul kept producing the delicious dropshots, ferocious forehands and luscious lobs to make life uncomfortable for the Spaniard.\n\nAs he drilled a backhand down the line winner past Alcaraz's outstretched racket to seal the first set and then broke for a 2-0 lead, he kept drawing roars of approval from the Court One crowd.\n\nBut just when he might have started dreaming that he might finally become the first American man to reach the semi-final at Wimbledon since John Isner in 2018, Alcaraz said enough was enough and quickly got to work to douse the fireworks.\n\nPaul managed to save 19 break points. But unfortunately for him he dropped serve eight times which was enough for an all-court tactician like Alcaraz, who has won majors on three different surfaces, to seal victory.\n\n\"He can play some seriously amazing, amazing tennis. Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll,\" Paul said.\n\nAfter being kept on court for just over three hours, the Spanish third seed won his 12th match in a row at the grasscourt major when Paul swiped the ball wide.\n\n\"I (always) believe I can come back, even if I am struggling or am in trouble. I believe I can find the solutions even if the opponent is playing great tennis. I believe in myself all the time,\" added Alcaraz, who will next meet 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev in a re-match of last year's semi-final.\n\n(Reporting by Pritha Sarkar; Editing by Alison Williams)", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dailymaverick.co.za", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lob (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/12359503.jpg?fit=1000%2C683&quality=89&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The 2023 Wimbledon champion lost the first set to a great Tommy Paul in the last 16, but changed gears in the second set dominating the rest of the match and qualifying for the semi-finals for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe 21-year-old Spaniard wants to repeat the extraordinary feat of last year, when he shocked the whole world by beating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the final and winning the most prestigious Slam in the world. 'Carlitos' will not face his great rival Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, because the Italian was surprisingly eliminated by Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe Russian expressed his best tennis career on grass and deserved the victory in the fifth set, also exploiting a virus that debilitated Sinner in the hours before the match. Alcaraz and Medvedev had already faced each other in the 2023 Wimbledon semi-final, when the Spaniard prevailed without losing a set. The Russian has often suffered the varied and unpredictable style of play of Alcaraz, who is able to put it out of position and make it closer to the net thanks to its beautiful dropshots. It will take the best Medvedev to reach his first career final at Church Road.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz wants to win the fourth Slam of his young career, the second this year after the French Open. Interviewed by MARCA after the victory of Carlos against Tommy Paul, Juan Carlos Ferrero analyzed the chances of Alcaraz at Wimbledon: \"We must try not to think about the title because there are still two matches left and the opponents are all strong.\n\nThe player should only think about the next match, it would be a mistake to get distracted or think you have already won. The most important thing is that Carlos' level is rising progressively and his opponents know they have to play very well to beat him in a match at the best of the five sets. Wimbledon is the most prestigious Slam, the one that all players in the world want to win. Alcaraz must remain calm and strong, which is a key aspect to its type of play.\"\n\nThe Spaniard's season was marked by some physical problems, but Carlos recovered in the spring by winning the Indian Wells Masters 1000 and especially the French Open last month. During the press conference, Carlitos opened up on the semifinal showdown against Medvedev: \"Daniil's a really great player. It's the same semi-final as last year so hopefully I'm going to get the same result. He just won against Sinner, the best player right now, so he's in really good shape and I have to play my best. I have to believe in myself and try to keep going. It's going to be difficult but I'm going to enjoy it.\"\n\nAfter his match against Sinner, Medvedev reflected on his chances of beating Alcaraz: \"It was important to just show I'm always gonna be there. I'm always gonna fight. I'm always gonna try to make your life difficult. Maybe you're gonna win more. Maybe I'm gonna win more. I don't know. But I'm gonna fight. The attitude was the same with Carlos last year at the US Open. It's gonna be the same with Carlos in a couple of days. To be honest.. That's always my goal. To know that whoever plays against me, they can win or they can lose, but they're gonna know it's gonna be a tough fight. It's gonna be a great match. Great for fans, great for me, great for my opponent,\" Medvedev explained.\n\nDespite his young age, Alcaraz has already proven himself to be a predestine and to be able to make the history of this sport. At just 21, the Spaniard has already won three Grand Slams, five Masters 1000 and was the World number 1. If he can find more continuity and limit physical problems, he may become unstoppable and reach the status of Big 3.\n\nIn addition to Wimbledon, Carlos also wants to win the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The current World No.3 will be the red clay favorite of the French Open, although he will have to be careful of Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic and his compatriot Rafa Nadal (with whom he will play doubles). Unlike Sinner and Nadal, Alcaraz will not play any tournament before arriving in Paris in three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ferrero", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Ferrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marca_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marca (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image151145.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The last one was super easy for him. It can happen. It's okay. For me it was important to come out and show that we going to play probably many more times if we are both on tour, probably semis, quarters, finals, whatever.\n\n\"For me, it was important to just show I'm always going to be there, I'm always going to fight, I'm always going to try to make your life difficult.\n\n\"Maybe you're going to win more; maybe I'm going to win more.

Doesn't mean that next time is going to be the same. That's a little bit the attitude I have.\n\n\"That's the same with Carlos last year in US Open.

His triumph last month at the French Open made him, at 21, the youngest man to collect a major trophy on hard, grass and clay courts.\n\nMedvedev, who is seeded No. 5 and defeated No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, won the 2021 U.S. Open but is just 1-5 in major finals.\n\nThe other match Friday will be No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his men's-record 24 Slam championships at Wimbledon, against No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti, making his debut in a major semifinal.\n\n\"Against him, you are probably more stressed, because he's probably the best player ever -- or one of the best players ever,\" said the 22-year-old Musetti, who beat Taylor Fritz in five sets on Wednesday, while Djokovic got the day off because his foe, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with an injured hip.\n\n\"You walk on court with a different mentality,\" said Musetti, whose 1-5 record against Djokovic includes a five-set loss at this year's French Open that ended at after 3 a.m. \"If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.\"\n\nAlcaraz vs. Medvedev is a rematch from last year's semifinals, when Alcaraz won in straight sets before getting past Djokovic in the final.\n\nIt also offers a contrast between a talented attacker (Alcaraz) and a consummate defender (Medvedev).\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" Alcaraz said. \"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back.\"\n\nAsked what Alcaraz's best quality is, Medvedev began this way: \"To be honest, everything.\"\n\n\"That's where it's tough to play against him, because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there. So you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can. Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it,\" said Medvedev, who has won just two of their previous six encounters.\n\n\"Carlos can do whatever, from any position,\" Medvedev said, \"and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nTommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American who lost to Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, put something else on the lengthy list of the Spaniard's attributes.\n\n\"He moves unbelievably well. He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him,\" Paul said. \"Grass suits him. He moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does. He stays pretty low. Yeah, I mean, it's not easy.\"\n\nAnd then, in a nod to the sort of highlight-reel material Alcaraz regularly produces, Paul added: \"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points -- because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 201, "textEnd": 207}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-21", "textStart": 465, "textEnd": 477}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The match is on the program on Friday, July 12\n\nOur Daniil Medvedev vs. Carlos Alcaraz prediction is that the 2024 Wimbledon semifinal is going to be one of the most exciting matches of the tournament. These two have met only twice in tournaments that use grass as the playing surface, and each time, the match lasted for just three sets. Will it be different this time? We think it might.\n\nWhen the betting markets were released, Daniil Medvedev's Wimbledon 2024 odds were +2800, suggesting that his chance of winning wasn't great. However, with a little bit of luck and a great deal of skill and determination, the 6'6 first-serve specialist got himself to the semifinals.\n\nIn the quarterfinal, he defeated the No. 1 player in the ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner. The match lasted for nearly four hours, after which the +280 underdog got a win.\n\nCan he upset the odds once more? He sure will try. One thing that's giving him confidence is that he's already won one Wimbledon match against Carlos Alcaraz, beating the Spaniard 3:0. However, it happened back in 2021, when Alcaraz was only 18.\n\nAfter finishing second in the ATP Rankings last year and dropping some points in the early months of 2024, Carlos Alcaraz finds himself in third place on the list of the best male players. However, despite a relatively slow start to the campaign, he switched to top gear in May and has been playing amazing tennis since.\n\nIn June, he won the 2024 French Open, and a month later, he's planning to do the same with Wimbledon. He's the defending champ in this tournament, having won the trophy last year after beating Novak Djokovic in the final and Daniil Medvedev in the semifinal.\n\nIn the match with Medvedev, Alcaraz was nothing short of brilliant, winning 3:0 after only one hour and 50 minutes spent on the court.\n\nOur prediction is that Alcaraz will win this match, but it won't be easy for him. Medvedev is great when it comes to serving the ball, so we might see the Spanish star struggle to deal with his powerful shots. Still, we do think that he's got what it takes to get to the final.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessie_carter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Jessie Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/medvedev-tennis-player.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 117, "textEnd": 124}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

For the third consecutive match, Alcaraz's resolve was given a stern test by his opponent, but the 21-year-old third seed kept his cool to seal a three-hour, 11-minute comeback victory on Centre Court.\n\n\"He has been playing great tennis on grass. He won Queen's and has been doing great stuff here at Wimbledon, beating great players,\" said Alcaraz of Paul in his on-court interview. \"Of course today was a really difficult match for me.\n\n\"At the beginning, the first set and the beginning of the second set, it kind of felt like I was playing on clay. Big rallies, 10 to 15 shots every point. So I had to stay strong mentally when I lost the first set.

I'm really happy to find the solutions and the good path.\"\n\nThe No. 13 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Paul laid the foundations for an upset after he took the opening set and opened a 2-0 lead in the second. However, that was as good as it got for the American, whose hopes of extending his 10th consecutive win were dashed by Alcaraz's ability to carve out opportunities on return.\n\nAlcaraz broke Paul's serve seven times across the second, third and fourth sets to secure a 3-2 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The three-time major winner, who converted eight of 27 break points he earned overall, will now prepare for a semi-final rematch against Daniil Medvedev, who earlier beat World No. 1 Jannik Sinner 6-7(7), 6-4, 7-6(4), 2-6, 6-3.\n\nA year ago, Alcaraz dispatched Medvedev for the loss of just nine games in the last four at the All England Club, and he has certainly been made to earn the right to try and repeat that result this year.

However, Alcaraz won their recent meeting in Cincinnati last year, clinching a round of 16 victory in three sets.\n\nWe say: Alcaraz to win in five sets\n\nTuesday's match-up should be fascinating for several reasons as Alcaraz's 11-match winning streak at Wimbledon meets Paul's ongoing nine-match sequence on grass.\n\nThe American has momentum but facing the defending champion is a different challenge entirely. Alcaraz's wont to dip within matches means Paul possibly forces a decider on Tuesday, with the Spaniard expected to continue his sequence of winning extended matches at Slams.\n\nbody check tags ::\n\nPreviews by email\n\nClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major game!", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_brown@amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Anthony Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Virtanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Otto Virtanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Draper_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Draper (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Bautista Agut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Mart\u00ednez_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Mart\u00ednez (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vukic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vukic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bublik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Bublik"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/27/carlos-alcaraz_2.jpg?w=300&h=225&auto=compress,format&fit=clip", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Or will either of the underdogs, Daniil Medvedev and Lorenzo Musetti, be able to cause an upset?\n\nGetting back to the Wimbledon semifinals for a second year in a row is an impressive feat for defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, but the path to this point has been a lot bumpier than his nearly flawless run in 2023.\n\nAlcaraz was untouchable on the grass a year ago, winning all 12 matches he played on the surface, culminating with a five-set thriller over Djokovic in the final.\n\nEven more stunning was that Alcaraz dropped just five sets in those dozen matches.\n\nIt would be nearly impossible to replicate that form, but Alcaraz's journey to the final four has been bumpier than anybody expected.\n\nThe Spaniard started the grass swing with an early exit at Queen's Club and he's had a couple of hairy moments at the Championships.\n\nAlcaraz cruised through the first two rounds, but he needed to come back in a five-set thriller against an out-of-form Frances Tiafoe and then was not all that convincing against Tommy Paul in a four-set victory.\n\nIf Paul had even his B-game, we'd probably be talking about him in this spot instead.\n\nWinning without your best stuff is the mark of a champion, but Alcaraz will need to find his level if he's to make it to back-to-back finals because Daniil Medvedev seems like a man on a mission.\n\nBewilderingly, Medvedev came into the tournament as a 60/1 outsider to win Wimbledon despite the fact that he made it to one final at a Grand Slam already in 2024 and was a semifinalist here in 2023.\n\nMedvedev's draw was tough and he didn't set the world alight during the clay swing, but it was pretty shocking to see him flying that far under the radar before the fortnight began.\n\nWhat was even more confusing was that Medvedev's outright price remained close to 40/1 even after he advanced into the fourth round.\n\nIt's clear that the betting market severely underestimated Medvedev going into the tournament and it's fair to wonder if oddsmakers are continuing to do so given his price against Alcaraz.\n\nThe defending champion absolutely deserves to be the favorite on Friday, but Medvedev was brilliant in a five-set victory over world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals and we haven't really seen Alcaraz at his best yet.\n\nThe Bet: Daniil Medvedev (+260, FanDuel Sportsbook)\n\nIt is not entirely true to say that it is surprising to see Djokovic in the Wimbledon semifinals this year, but there were certainly a lot more people who doubted that the 37-year-old Serb could pull it off this time around the block considering his form and the fact that he's one month removed from knee surgery.\n\nBut, as he's wont to do, Djokovic has silenced the skeptics with another deep run.\n\nAnd he also caught a big break when Alex de Minaur had to pull out of their quarterfinal clash with an injury.\n\nDjokovic will have had three full days to rest after his quick, painless victory over Holger Rune on Monday.\n\nKnown for his clay-court ability, Lorenzo Musetti is certainly a surprising semifinalist, but he's had a relatively easy path with a woeful Taylor Fritz as his only true test so far.\n\nA fresh Djokovic should be able to overwhelm the Italian, especially after defeating him at Roland Garros in June.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"},

However, there will be no blockbuster showdown with Jannik Sinner, as the world number one was dragged the distance and eliminated.\n\nAlcaraz, who increased his Grand Slam tally to three at the French Open last month, continued his quest to retain a major trophy for the first time by rallying past American Tommy Paul 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2.

Medvedev, Carlos Alcaraz vs Tommy Paul: Wimbledon quarter-final predictions", "body": "Carlos Alcaraz vs Tommy Paul, Jannik Sinner vs Daniil Medvedev are the first two men's quarter-finals.\n\nWhen the Wimbledon men's singles draw was made, all eyes moved to one half of the draw.\n\nThat was the top half, where top seed Jannik Sinner and reigning SW19 champion Carlos Alcaraz were drawn into a potential semi-final clash - much like at Roland Garros.\n\nThe two have split the first two majors of 2024 and are a match away from another Grand Slam meeting, but both face crunch clashes that they could lose next.\n\nSinner takes on fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in an Australian Open final rematch, while Alcaraz faces 12th seed Tommy Paul in a battle of the past two Queen's Club Championships.\n\nAhead of Tuesday, we make our quarter-final predictions.\n\nInto a third straight Wimbledon quarter-final aged only 22, Sinner has largely justified why so many predicted him to win the title this fortnight.\n\nThe Italian wobbled early on against Yannick Hanfmann and Matteo Berrettini, but won both those in four sets - and was then in cruise control against Miomir Kecmanovic and Ben Shelton.\n\nMedvedev, meanwhile, was dealt a slight stroke of luck with Grigor Dimitrov's early retirement in the fourth round, but has gone deep at SW19 once again despite a previous apathy to grass.\n\nSinner and Medvedev were the beaten semi-finalists a year ago, and the fact they are back in the last eight is a testament to the improvements both have made on this surface.\n\nWith a penetrating serve and flat hitting, the world No 1 has a game that should thrive on the surface, and he has had the better of his recent clashes against the Russian.\n\nMedvedev leads the head-to-head 6-5, but Sinner was 6-0 down in that rivalry - he has won their last five matches, starting with his win in Beijing - and including his Australian Open win from two sets down.\n\nHe has the momentum in this rivalry and, after impressive performances in rounds three and four, it's close to impossible to pick against him.\n\nPrediction: Jannik Sinner in straight sets\n\n'Even if Jannik Sinner has very big power, Carlos Alcaraz has even more'\n\nIncredible Jannik Sinner stat equals Open Era record that 'Big 3', Carlos Alcaraz cannot match\n\nAlcaraz is so often the heavy favourite in his matches, but that is not the case here.\n\nPaul is one of the few players that the Spaniard has not repeatedly had the better of, and the American holds his own in their head-to-head: they have split their four encounters with two wins each.\n\nAnd, in the form of his life, the 12th seed has found his very best on the grass this summer.\n\nThe 27-year-old comes into this contest on a nine-match win streak, winning the biggest title of his career at Queen's before reaching just his second Grand Slam quarter-final.\n\nAlcaraz has not convinced in his last two matches against 29th seed Frances Tiafoe and 16th seed Ugo Humbert, having to battle his way through both.\n\nIt is clear that Paul's all-court consistency has also been an issue, and with the Spaniard a little up and down, he will not have an easy time in this encounter.\n\nBut the three-time Slam winner has by far the biggest peak of the two, and if he can maintain that for long enough, he should win.\n\nPrediction: Carlos

It was an incredible implosion, or at least it would have been had we not seen these kind of struggles with Vekic before. She went through an excruciating defeat from an advantageous position against Serbian Olga Danilovic at the French Open.\n\nShe was trailing by a set to Wimbledon's fairytale story, a qualifier from outside the world's top 100. She had lost her previous two Grand Slam quarterfinals. It felt like a case of here we go again.\n\nBut Vekic then did something pretty remarkable. She reset, broke Sun in the next game to take the second set and promptly won the first 13 points of the decider to race to a 3-0 lead. In so doing she got more than halfway towards the \"golden set,\" when you win one without dropping a point. In the end she had to settle for a 6-1 mauling, which worked just fine as the exclamation mark on the first two sets, which went 5-7, 6-4. It's her first Grand Slam semifinal in 43 attempts.\n\nA big part of the explanation for the turnaround is that Sun collapsed physically, with nothing left in the tank after battling through qualifying and then playing three three-setters in her four main draw matches en route to the quarters. But a big amount of credit also goes to Vekic, who said afterwards that she channelled her fury with herself into something positive.\n\nIs Carlos Alcaraz learning to win without a highlight reel?\n\nThe biggest change in the Carlos Alcaraz who was down in the dumps six months ago may be inside his brain.\n\nAlcaraz has been pretty up front about his lulls in focus, especially when his game used to get away from him. A few wayward forehands and the youngest world No. 1 in the history of the rankings would begin to spiral.\n\nAfter beating Tommy Paul 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in the quarterfinals Tuesday, Alcaraz talked about how he has come to understand that playing poorly doesn't mean he has to lose.\n\n\"It's going to be really difficult to play my best tennis every match,\" he said. In the first set against Paul, the American dominated in five to eight shot rallies, winning 14 to Alcaraz's 7. Alcaraz closed that gap in the next set and used his own dominance on shorter points to stay ahead.\n\n\"I know that there are going to be some matches that I'm not going to find my best tennis even though I have to try to win it.\n\n\"I think that's what the Big Three did during their career, they are not going to play their best tennis. Even like that, they are going to find their good tennis just to win those matches. That's what I'm thinking.\"\n\nTime on the tour also helps. After more than three years of watching Alcaraz, his opponents know the magic can re-emerge at any moment. One miracle point, like the forehand down the line he hit against Ugo Humbert in the previous round, and he can start running downhill.\n\n\"Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points because when he does, he gets on a roll,\" said Paul. That's a bit of a problem because those crazy points only happen when he's on his heels. Don't let Alcaraz get in trouble? If that's the secret, his opponents are basically going to have to reinvent the sport.\n\nMatt Futterman\n\nHow are the Wimbledon roofs becoming match factors?\n\nDiscussing the conditions at this year's Wimbledon, Vekic's coach Pam Shriver told The Athletic on Tuesday that in her four decades of coming here she'd never seen such dampness and humidity. Her charge Vekic is able to hit through the court, and if you're as big a hitter as she is then the dampness can be an advantage, because very few of her rivals can.\n\nBut physically, playing in such humidity is tough for everyone.\n\n\"Conditions were not easy today because when the roof is closed, it's very humid,\" said Daniil Medvedev after his five-set win over Jannik Sinner.\n\n\"Like it's very... not even humid, but you don't have much air. So in a way at one point in the match you feel like you lose concentration because it just gets to you, like this humidity, the sound of the rain. You don't hear any more the sound of your shots. It's like something is falling on your head constantly, so it's not easy.\"\n\nIt looked like the humidity was compounding the dizziness that Sinner spoke of afterwards and forced him off the court for almost 10 minutes in the third set. He played down the importance of the conditions afterwards, but sitting on court, the humidity was striking, and they were clearly very unforgiving conditions.\n\nThe seven-time champion Novak Djokovic said on Monday that the constant rain had made this feel like an \"indoor\" tournament. Not that he'll be complaining, given he's arguably the best indoor player of all time.\n\nThe randomness of the weather means that tomorrow, the forecast is good, so the second set of quarterfinals will be played outdoors. As and when the roof closes again, it may come down to who adapts best.\n\nBecause even from Centre Court to Court 1 there are big differences, as reigning champion Alcaraz explained after playing on the latter for his win over Tommy Paul on Tuesday.\n\n\"The grass is different,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel like there was more sand on Court 1 than Centre Court.\n\n\"I had to adapt my game on that. I didn't feel comfortable at all playing on Court 1 with the conditions on it. I tried to play my best tennis on it ... It was difficult to find it.\"\n\nTuesday figured to be bright for American tennis. Emma Navarro was taking on Jasmine Paolini. She was 3-0 against her ahead of their quarterfinal. Tommy Paul was taking on Carlos Alcaraz. He was 2-2.\n\nBy early evening both were out of Wimbledon after fairly one-sided matches. Paul got the first set off Alcaraz but his game deteriorated from there.\n\n\"I couldn't find a first serve,\" Paul said. \"It's tough to play anybody in the top hundred not serving well on first serves. He was all over my second, it felt like. It wasn't a fun situation.\"\n\nNavarro was nothing like the player who beat Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff on her way to the quarterfinals. She lost 2-6, 1-6.\n\n\"(It's) Tough to feel like I was playing such good tennis for a while there, made a run, then I just faced a really, really tough opponent today that played lights out and didn't give me anything,\" Navarro said. \"I didn't play my best.\"\n\nFritz takes on Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Wednesday.

Paul conjured some breathtaking shot-making as he opened up a 7-5 2-0 lead and kept drawing roars of approval from the Court One crowd while making life uncomfortable for the third seed.\n\nAs Alcaraz desperately chased after the winners flying off Paul's racket, the Spaniard often found himself sliding and slipping over around the threadbare baseline with the match taking place under a closed roof on another wet day in London. However, any hopes Paul might have harboured of ending his country's 21-year-wait for a men's Grand Slam champion at the All England Club this weekend were eventually snuffed out as the 21-year-old Alcaraz produced the goods on the crunch moments to run away with the final two sets.\n\nDuring the spellbinding exchanges, Paul managed to save 19 break points. But unfortunately for him he dropped serve eight times which was enough for an all-court tactician like Alcaraz, who has won majors on three different surfaces, to seal victory. After being kept on court for just over three hours, the third seed won his 12th match in a row at the grasscourt major when Paul swiped the ball wide.\n\n\"He has been playing great tennis on grass, he won Queen's (last month), he has been doing great stuff at Wimbledon beating great players. Today was a really difficult match for me,\" Alcaraz, who will next meet 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev in a re-match of last year's semi-final, told the crowd on a on-court interview. \"In the first set and at the beginning of the second set, (it felt like) I was playing on clay, with big rallies and every point going over 10-15 shots.\n\n\"I had to stay strong mentally when I lost the first set, it was difficult for me.

However, standing in their way are Daniil Medvedev and Lorenzo Musetti, who has made the semi-final of a Grand Slam for the first time.\n\nSpanish world number three Alcaraz defeated Medvedev in straight sets in last year's semi-final at the All England Club before the Russian avenged that loss with an impressive last-four victory at the US Open. Alcaraz, 21, is bidding to reach his fourth Slam final before setting his sights on becoming only the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back.\n\nIt has been an uneven Wimbledon for the Spaniard -- he was pushed to five sets by Frances Tiafoe in the third round and then needed four sets to see off Ugo Humbert and Tommy Paul. Alcaraz holds a 4-2 head-to-head lead over Medvedev, a player he likened to \"a wall, every ball bounces back\". Medvedev is looking to reach a seventh Grand Slam final.\n\nThe fifth-ranked Russian, a former US Open champion, stunned top seed Jannik Sinner in five sets in the quarter-finals, gaining revenge for his defeat to the Italian in January's Australian Open final. \"It's tough to play against Carlos because you know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there,\" said Medvedev. Medvedev has hit 64 aces to Alcaraz's 52 so far. He has dropped served eight times while Alcaraz has seen his service games breached 16 times.\n\nDjokovic has equalled Roger Federer's mark by reaching a 13th Wimbledon semi-final and is two wins from matching the Swiss star's record of eight singles titles at the All England Club. Victory in the Wimbledon final would take him to a 10th final at the tournament.\n\nAt 37, Djokovic could also become the oldest champion of the modern era, an impressive achievement for a man who underwent knee surgery as recently as last month. This season he has lost his Australian Open and French Open titles and has yet to make a final on tour.

He's beat some of the top players in tennis history, like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, already in his career. He has three more matches to try to hold another Wimbledon trophy.\n\nSo, how many Grand Slam titles has Alcaraz won in his young career? He's made history a few times in major tournaments, so take a look below at Alcaraz's major statistics.\n\nHow Many Grand Slam Titles Has Carlos Alcaraz Won?\n\nAlcaraz has already won three major tournaments in just four years of professional tennis. He made history after winning the 2024 French Open last month, becoming the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on all three surfaces -- hard court, clay and grass.\n\nThe Spaniard's first major title came in 2022 when he won the U.S. Open over Casper Ruud in four sets -- 6-4, 2-6, 7-6, 6-3. At 19 years old, he became the youngest men's tennis player to ever reach World No. 1 with the win.\n\nAlcaraz then won his second major title the following summer at Wimbledon. He took down Novak Djokovic in a five-set thriller -- 1-6, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 -- to become just the second person after Andy Murray to beat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.\n\nAlcaraz won the French Open in June 2024 over Alexander Zverev in another five-set match, 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2.\n\nIn order to fulfill his career Grand Slam, Alcaraz still needs to win the Australian Open. He's only reached the quarterfinals in this major tournament.\n\nHow Many Grand Slam Finals Has Carlos Alcaraz Appeared in?\n\nAlcaraz has yet to be a runner-up at a Grand Slam tournament. The only three times he's appeared in a final have been during the three major titles he's won.\n\nHere's his Grand Slam record since the Australian Open in 2021, the first time he qualified for a major tournament.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madison_williams@si.com", "name": "Madison Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4670,h_2626,x_0,y_150/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j29z18hsemxhpz7ntv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

That he clapped his beaten foe off the court at the end of the contest gives some idea of what the pair had experienced together.\n\nAfter a five-set triumph over Frances Tiafoe, where he was just a tiebreak away from crashing out, and a tricky four-set win over Ugo Humbert in his previous two matches, Alcaraz is having to work harder than many anticipated in his title defence.\n\nBut the things we want most are rarely easily obtained and to join the illustrious list of five (Laver, Borg, Nadal, Federer, Djokovic) to win the men's singles title at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year, it's only right that he truly earns it. And boy did he earn it today.\n\nIn an enthralling match, it was the first set in particular that will live long in the memory. One hour and 12 minutes of scintillating tennis that enraptured a Court 1 crowd left marvelling at the athleticism, power and ingenuity of both men. It was as pure a contest of clean, flat hitting as this famous old court has seen.\n\nIf, for some reason, Paul had forgotten the size of the challenge awaiting him against the defending champion, it took all of one game for Alcaraz to remind him. The Spaniard flew out of the blocks and earned four break points across the course of a game that, at seven minutes long, seemed remarkable but merely proved a taster of things to come.\n\nTo his credit, Paul dug deep to save each of the four and then, in his second service game, saved a fifth before finally succumbing to the relentless tidal wave at the sixth time of asking as Alcaraz found the line with a sublime forehand winner.\n\nAlcaraz was already in full flow, combining baseline power-hitting with the guile of his patented drop shots and deft hands at the net. But if he needed a reminder of the challenge awaiting him against the man who won Queen's last month, Paul delivered it in game four to immediately break back thanks to a scarcely believable backhand down the line on the run for a clean winner.\n\nFrom there, the opening set reached overdrive and the sixth game, with Alcaraz serving at 2-3, will probably go down as the greatest single game at this year's championship. Paul gave the champion a taste of his own medicine with a disguised drop shot followed by a passing shot winner to bring up one of four break points but having his own weapon used against him only angered the Spaniard. On the very next point, he returned the favour by slicing a drop shot from the back of the court that the American was unlikely to get to even if he hadn't slipped after being fooled.\n\nAfter a ridiculous nine deuces, the No 3 seed eventually scraped the hold and roared as loud a \"VAMOS\" as he ever has on the grass courts of Wimbledon as the crowd yelled their approval right back.\n\nThat marathon ensured the first six games of the match alone took 40 minutes but the real drama of the set was still to come. Just when it seemed destined for a tiebreak, the underdog growled and secured a 7-5 win with a timely break of serve, sealed by a remarkable passing shot down the line on the run.\n\nAfter 72 minutes of tennis played at as high a level as it's possible to produce, Paul had the hardest earned of sets on the board but the beauty of men's grand slam play is that still meant he was only a third of the way to a semi-final spot.\n\nMany would have been crushed by the manner of defeat in the opening salvo and, perhaps understandably, Alcaraz still looked shell-shocked at the start of the second set - promptly losing his serve by firing a routine forehand wide, having already thrown in a double fault earlier in the game. But like all true champions, the No 3 seed dug deep, refocused and slowly began to impose his will on the quarter-final.\n\nThe feeling that the 21-year-old would be the more likely of the pair to maintain the super-human levels they had both displayed in the first set ultimately proved correct. He immediately got the break back and, as if to prove that highlight-reel shot-making after long rallies isn't the only way he's capable of winning points, then opened up another service game with three straight aces before sealing it with an unreturned second serve.\n\nAs Paul faltered just slightly, Alcaraz punished him - breaking serve again in the middle of the second set as the American threw in two double faults and rode that advantage out to a 6-4 win.\n\nThe third set was even more ruthless. Paul was still showing flashes of the inspired player from that opening 72 minutes with sliding volley winners and crushed forehands but couldn't string points together in the same way. When a couple of break-back points went begging at 3-2, Alcaraz promptly confirmed a double break en route to a 6-2 triumph.\n\nSniffing the finish line, last year's champion went for the throat. An early break in the fourth set sent the 12 seed despondently shuffling back to his chair and when a Paul forehand floated wide to confirm a double break at 4-1, the game was up. A 6-2 victory rounded out the win as both players embraced at the net and Alcaraz then clapped off his vanquished foe. Medvedev now awaits in an intriguing Friday semi-final on Centre Court.\n\nIf Alcaraz does go on to complete the 'Channel Slam' on Sunday, this match may just be a historical footnote in the journey but those lucky enough to witness it won't forget it in a hurry.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fault_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double fault (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/818ae2e6ceb91cd4cbf05730d9af5b23", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

But that-if it happens-is still a round away.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz vs. Tommy Paul is perhaps the most underrated rivalry at the moment. That will happen.\n\nAlcaraz and Paul will be squaring off for the fifth time in their careers when they clash in the Wimbledon quarterfinals on Tuesday afternoon. They have split their four previous encounters at two wins apiece and three of the four have required a deciding set. Alcaraz won in straight sets at the 2023 Miami Open and 7-6(6), 6-7(0), 6-3 last summer in Cincinnati. Paul prevailed twice in Canada-6-7(4), 7-6(7), 6-3 in 2022 and 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in 2023.\n\nThe next installment should be another blockbuster battle.\n\nAlcaraz will be prepared for a test, because his previous rounds were far from straightforward. The 21-year-old Spaniard beat both Mark Lajal and Aleksandar Vukic in straight sets, but neither was particularly routine. Alcaraz then had to come back from two sets to one down against Frances Tiafoe before defeating Ugo Humbert 7-5 in the fourth.\n\nAlthough Paul is obviously a sizable underdog, he has been more impressive so far this fortnight. The 27-year-old American secured a spot in the last eight by beating Pedro Martinez, Otto Virtanen (five sets), Alexander Bublik, and Roberto Bautista Agut. Paul is now 31-10 this season, including 10-1 on grass with a title at Queen's Club.\n\n\"We both play a pretty aggressive style of tennis,\" the world No. 13 assessed. \"He's been playing pretty well and ultra aggressive. I mean, it's fun for people to watch. Honestly, it's fun to play against. I'm really excited for the matchup.\"\n\nEveryone should be. These are two of the best athletes on tour and their matchups generally produce extreme entertainment.

He was dizzy, and he hadn't slept well the night before. Wimbledon's top-seeded man, who recently attained the No 1 ranking, definitely did not want to quit playing against Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals, but things were not looking good.\n\nSinner was treated by a trainer and left the court during the third set Tuesday, then briefly surged before faltering again down the stretch, eventually losing to a more-aggressive-than-usual Medvedev 6-7 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 6-3.\n\n\"I was struggling physically,\" said Sinner, who had won his past five matches against Medvedev, including a five-setter in the final of the Australian Open in January. \"It was not an easy moment. I tried to fight with that what I had today.\"\n\nIt wasn't enough.\n\nNot against the crafty Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, who will now face Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals at the All England Club for the second consecutive year.\n\n\"It was a bit of an up-and-down match, in a way, from both sides,\" Medvedev said.\n\nAlcaraz, the defending champion and No 3 seed, took a bit of time to get going in his quarterfinal, but once he did, there was no stopping him during a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory over 12th seed Tommy Paul of the United States on No 1 Court.\n\n\"We try just to find solutions,\" said Alcaraz, coming off a title at the French Open last month and seeking his fourth Grand Slam trophy. \"For me, obviously, it's going to be really difficult to play my best tennis every match.\"\n\nAgainst Paul, Alcaraz raised his level after a so-so opening set, putting together a 26-12 advantage in winners over the last three.\n\n\"When he starts building energy and building momentum, it feels a little bit different than most of the other guys,\" Paul said. \"He can play some seriously amazing tennis.\"\n\nAlcaraz, who leads Medvedev 4-2 in head-to-heads, said it would be tough to face the former US Open winner, picking out his ability to get the ball back in play.\n\n\"The most difficult thing about facing Daniil, or the most special thing about him, is he can reach every ball,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, he is like a wall. Every ball bounces back. I feel like I can hit an unbelievable shot, and the ball is going to bounce back.\"\n\nMedvedev, for his part, said three-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz, 21, was a danger anywhere on the court.\n\nAlcaraz said he was delighted that opponents feared him in such a way, because it meant they had to \"focus on every shot\".\n\n\"You know, whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there,\" said Medvedev, \"so you try to make his life difficult. You try to hit the shot as good as you can.\n\n\"Maybe he goes for it and he cannot make it, but that's pretty special because there are not many players like this. Carlos can do whatever from any position, and that's not easy to play against.\"\n\nOver on Centre Court, it was not immediately clear what was wrong with Sinner, who leaned back in his sideline chair, rested his head in a hand and had his heart rate checked, before heading to the locker room. During a later changeover, Sinner draped a towel over his head.\n\nWhile he did regain his usual verve, particularly on his booming forehand, and pushed the match to a fifth set -- the 36th this fortnight and the most at any Grand Slam tournament in the Open era, which dates to 1968 -- Sinner could not get over the line.\n\nEven though he won more points (164-160), accumulated more winners (61-56), made fewer unforced errors (49-45), hit more aces (17-15) and finished with far fewer double-faults (11-4).\n\n\"It's a tough one to swallow,\" Sinner said.\n\nMedvedev began playing closer to the baseline than he often does. The 28-year-old Russian found the space to deliver more winners, compiling 13 in the closing set alone, broke for a 3-1 lead in the fifth, and was on his way back to the semifinals.\n\n\"Today,\" Medvedev said, \"a lot of tactical things worked well.\"\n\nAgainst Sinner in Australia, Medvedev took the first two sets, but Sinner clawed all the way back to win his first Grand Slam title.\n\nThat result dropped Medvedev's career record in major finals to 1-5.Now he's one victory from a seventh such appearance.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can win some more Grand Slams,\" Medvedev said. \"I believe in myself. I believe in my tennis.\"\n\nIn the women's quarterfinals, Donna Vekic reached the final four at a major for the first time in her 43rd Slam, defeating qualifier Lulu Sun 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, and French Open runner-up Jasmine Paolini eliminated No 19 seed Emma Navarro 6-2, 6-1 in less than an hour.\n\n\"If you had told me before Roland Garros that I would get to the final there and the Wimbledon semifinals,\" Paolini said with a laugh. \"I would have said you were crazy.\"\n\nUntil last week, she was 0-3 at the All England Club, and until Tuesday, was 0-3 against Navarro.\n\nNavarro got past four-time major champion Naomi Osaka and reigning US Open champ Coco Gauff earlier in the tournament.\n\n\"I know this isn't the last time I'm going to be in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam,\" Navarro said. \"I know I'll be back.\"\n\nVekic, a 28-year-old from Croatia, pondered quitting the sport on multiple occasions -- including as recently as right before play began at Roland Garros in May.\n\n\"I didn't have any energy, any motivation to keep practicing, keep pushing, because I felt like the last couple of months I've given everything for tennis, and I wasn't getting the results that I kind of expected,\" Vekic said.\n\n\"Now I'm the semifinals,\" Vekic said. \"Not just in tennis, (but) in life, things can turn pretty fast.\"\n\nSinner was a Wimbledon semifinalist a year ago and moved up to No 1 in the ATP rankings, replacing Novak Djokovic there, on June 10 after getting to the semifinals at the French Open.\n\nHis exit follows that of the No 1 women's seed, Iga Swiatek, in the third round.\n\nIt is the first time since 2018 that both the top woman and top man have exited Wimbledon before the semifinals. That year, Roger Federer lost in the quarterfinals, and Simona Halep in the third round.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202407/11/668f36b1a31095c551b4f953.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 5674, "textEnd": 5681}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

When Wimbledon posted about it, Alcaraz responded with a spirited \"Let's go!!\" caption on social media.\n\nThis moment epitomized the support Alcaraz enjoys from the Wimbledon crowd, arguably positioning him as the favorite non-British men's tennis player at SW19.\n\nOne reason for Alcaraz's immense popularity could be his remarkable achievement last year when he won Wimbledon at the tender age of 20 by defeating Novak Djokovic, who often plays the role of the anti-hero.\n\nThat victory showcased Alcaraz's greatness and won the hearts of many fans who admire his potential and skill. Beating Djokovic in the final showed the youngster's talent and resilience.\n\nAlcaraz plays with a lovely mix of grace and flamboyance. His ability to make tennis look far too easy and knack for pulling off incredible points , have made him a darling of the Wimbledon crowd.\n\nThis adoration is similar to what Roger Federer experienced in his heyday. Federer's elegance and ease on the grass courts made him a fan favorite, and Alcaraz seems to be following in his footsteps.\n\nThe Spaniard's style, reminiscent of Federer's, combines skill with visual appeal, making his matches a treat for the spectators. Besides his on-court genius, Alcaraz's rising popularity could also be attributed to his humility, grace and sense of humor outside of it.\n\nFans got to see another instance of the same and have a good laugh with Alcaraz after he defeated Paul.\n\nWhen asked by the interviewer in the on-court interaction about his upcoming semi-final, Alcaraz immediately remembered last year. It was at the same stage when he played against the same opponent, Daniil Medvedev. Since the Spaniard won on that occasion, he commented that he is hoping for the same result this year too.\n\nHis comment, made with a blend of confidence and humor, showcased his optimistic outlook and connection with the fans.\n\nThis ability to engage with the audience and maintain a positive attitude underlines why Alcaraz is rapidly becoming a fan favorite at Wimbledon.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rishika_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rishika Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/f1890432-untitled-design-2024-07-11t013626.174.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Really happy about the level that I'm playing,\" added Alcaraz, who was still in a crib when American Andy Roddick won the U.S. Open title in 2003.\n\nSinner is another of the men's tour's young guns who was heavily backed to succeed at the grasscourt Grand Slam after his breakthrough Australian Open triumph and a potential encounter with Alcaraz had left fans excited following the draw.\n\nThe ailing 22-year-old came crashing down to earth against fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their Melbourne Park title clash, however, a sobering result that snapped a run of five straight wins over the Russian.\n\nBRAVE FIGHT\n\nSinner put up a brave fight under the Centre Court roof after a timeout due to illness but the Italian was unable to prevent a 6-7(7) 6-4 7-6(4) 2-6 6-3 defeat.\n\n\"This morning I didn't feel great. I had some problems. Then with the fatigue, it was tough,\" said Sinner.\n\n\"But take nothing away from Daniil. He played smart. Played good tennis. That's it ...

But I'm an ambitious guy and I like to be challenged.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/4d97ad8a-3c01-11ef-904c-005056bf30b7/510873fb9cd5d66a47fff359c6e4b7546a9cd616.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "2024-07-415603609", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-09", "time": "00:13:26", "dateTime": "2024-07-09T00:13:26Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-09T00:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/40522291/2024-wimbledon-rankings-win-title", "title": "Ranking the Wimbledon field: The five contenders who can win each title", "body": "WIMBLEDON, England -- After an emotional start at the All England Club with Andy Murray's final matches, we've officially reached the quarterfinals.\n\nThere have been some surprising results, injuries and upsets -- including the first-round exit of defending champion Marketa Vondrousova and upsets of No. 1 Iga Swiatek and No. 2 Coco Gauff -- and a mixture of favorites and relative unknowns remain in the hunt for the title in both draws.\n\nBut who has the best chance in each draw to ultimately be victorious? Here are our completely unscientific rankings of the top five remaining players in each draw:\n\nMen\n\n1. Jannik Sinner: Playing as the top seed in a major for the first time, the 22-year-old has certainly looked the part so far. Sinner, the 2024 Australian Open champion, was challenged in his second-round match against a resurgent Matteo Berrettini. He needed tiebreaks to win the opening two sets against the 2021 Wimbledon finalist, and then had no answers in the third set. But Sinner dug in during the fourth set and earned the 7-6(3), 7-6(4), 2-6, 7-6(4) win behind a strong serving performance and composure under pressure.\n\nHe then responded on Friday with a clinical straight-set victory over Miomir Kecmanovic in just 96 minutes. Sinner later told reporters he felt \"much better on court\" than he had on Thursday and was pleased with the result.\n\nSinner, who won his first career grass title at Halle last month, looked even more in control with a straight-set win over Ben Shelton on Sunday. He will have his toughest test yet against Daniil Medvedev, a fellow 2023 semifinalist, on Tuesday but he certainly has seemed up to the task so far.\n\n2. Carlos Alcaraz: After relatively routine matches in his first two rounds, the defending champion faced a familiar foe in the Round of 32 on Friday against Frances Tiafoe. A rematch of the classic 2022 US Open semifinal, No. 29 seed Tiafoe pushed No. 3 seed Alcaraz to the brink and had him six points away from an early exit during the fourth set. However, Alcaraz found a way to raise his level to force a tiebreak, and then a final set, which he dominated. After nearly four hours of play, Alcaraz emerged victorious 5-7, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2.\n\nThe match served as a reminder that he can fend off some of the toughest of opponents on any surface -- and is extremely tough to beat in five sets.\n\n\"In every match that I've played fifth sets, I played really close or my best tennis,\" Alcaraz said on Saturday. \"I realized that I'm good at it and I believe that I'm going to win. I think that's the good point for me.\"\n\nAlcaraz entered the tournament as the co-favorite with Sinner but will have to fend off a tricky Tommy Paul on Tuesday if he wants to set up a semifinal showdown with Sinner. That won't be easy. Alcaraz has shown vulnerabilities on the grass this season and Paul is on a nine-match win streak. Not to mention, they have a 2-2 head-to-head record.\n\n3. Novak Djokovic: It's hard to believe that just over a week ago Djokovic's status to play in the tournament was in doubt following his surgery on a torn medial meniscus in his right knee last month. While he has been wearing a gray knee brace during matches and his movement isn't entirely where he wants to be, he has been dominant in his first four matches. Even when he lost the opening set to Alexei Popyrin in the Round of 32, Djokovic remained unflustered and fought his way back to win the next three sets.\n\nAgainst No. 15 seed Holger Rune on Monday, Djokovic wasted no time and frustrated his younger opponent from the start by winning the first 12 points of the match. Djokovic advanced to his 15th Wimbledon quarterfinals with perhaps his most straightforward victory of the tournament, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, in just over two hours.\n\nPlaying in the opposite side of the draw as Sinner and Alcaraz, Djokovic will play No. 9 seed Alex de Minaur on Wednesday. De Minaur, who lost to Djokovic in the 2023 Australian Open fourth round, said that match was \"quite the challenge\" and said he wasn't surprised to see Djokovic already back to a high level after surgery.\n\n\"Back in the fourth round playing some great tennis, looking like he never left,\" de Minaur said on Monday ahead of Djokovic's win. \"It's just what Novak does.\"\n\nIf Djokovic were to defeat de Minaur, who sustained a minor hip injury during match point of his fourth-round match, he would take on Taylor Fritz or Lorenzo Musetti with a spot in the final on the line. Then he'd have a chance to compete for his eighth Wimbledon title.\n\nDjokovic has a 9-0 record against Fritz, including most recently at the Australian Open quarterfinals, and a 5-1 record over Musetti.\n\n4. Taylor Fritz: There's perhaps no one with more momentum and confidence than the 26-year-old American right now. Fritz won the title at Eastbourne in the final lead-in event and staged a valiant comeback over Alexander Zverev after losing the first two sets during their fourth-round clash on Monday.\n\nA 2022 quarterfinalist, Fritz narrowly missed out on the semifinals after losing a deciding-set tiebreak to Rafael Nadal, but two years later looks poised to take it at least one step further. He will next play Musetti on Wednesday with a chance to advance to his first major semifinal. Knowing how devastating the loss was to Nadal, expect Fritz to do everything in his power to reverse his fortunes this time around. Even Zverev seemed to think he would do just that.\n\n\"He is playing great,\" Zverev said about Fritz after their match. \"I think he is also going to be in the semifinals of Wimbledon. I do expect him to win in the quarters.\"\n\n5. Tommy Paul: As mentioned above, Paul is on a nine-match win streak. He won the first grass-court title of his career last month at Queen's Club, where he defeated Musetti in the final in straight sets and had previously beaten Jack Draper, who had upset Alcaraz in the round before.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Paul has continued to look increasingly comfortable on the surface and easily dispatched No. 23 seed Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in the third round. He then advanced to his first quarters at the All England Club with another straight-set victory on Sunday against Roberto Bautista Agut. It will be an uphill battle to defeat the defending champion in the quarters but he's beaten him before and was excited about the challenge.\n\n\"We both play a pretty aggressive style of tennis,\" Paul said of Alcaraz. \"He's been playing pretty well and ultra aggressive. I mean, it's fun for people to watch. Honestly, it's fun to play against. I'm really excited for the matchup.\"\n\nWomen\n\n1. Elena Rybakina: The only remaining Wimbledon champion in the women's draw, Rybakina looks to have rediscovered her 2022 form, and, with the absences and exits of many of the other top players, is the heavy favorite to win her second major title.\n\nAfter a tough match in the second round against Laura Siegemund, the 25-year-old responded with a prolific performance against former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, 6-0, 6-1, and was on her way to another lopsided result on Sunday before Anna Kalinskaya had to retire with injury.\n\nWith a game well-suited to grass, and with proven results on the surface, Rybakina said she is feeling much more comfortable during the 2024 campaign than she did in 2022.\n\n\"I think before going further in the draw I was pretty nervous in 2022,\" Rybakina said on Monday. \"But now I feel just more confidence playing match by match. It is different. At the same time when you go on the court you are still nervous a little bit. I think now with all the experiences, I just enjoy it much more on the court.\"\n\nWhile she certainly has the odds in her favor, she doesn't have the easiest path to the final. Playing in the top half of the draw, in which three major champions remain, she will first have to get past 2023 semifinalist Elina Svitolina. The two have a 2-2 career record against one another with Rybakina having won their last meeting at the French Open last month. If she can do that, either Jelena Ostapenko or Barbora Krejcikova will await in the semifinals. Two potentially tough matches to be sure, but if anyone is capable from this side of the draw, it's Rybakina.\n\n2. Emma Navarro: The 19th-seeded American continued her dream run at Wimbledon with an impressive 6-4, 6-3 victory over Gauff on Sunday to advance to the first major quarterfinal of her career. It was her second victory over a former major champion at the All England Club after defeating Naomi Osaka 6-4, 6-1 in the second round. She's also dropped just one set throughout the tournament. Even Navarro seemed somewhat surprised by how well she's fared against big-name opponents in front of large crowds.\n\n\"I've kind of been just way more comfortable playing on that stage than I would have thought I would have felt,\" Navarro said after the win over Gauff. \"I let the practice that I've put in and the hours of work that I've put in just take control I guess.\"\n\nPlaying in the far-more-wide-open and inexperienced bottom portion of the draw, Navarro now has a chance to reach the semifinals. She will face No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini, who reached the French Open final last month, on Tuesday. The winner of Tuesday's other quarterfinal clash between Lulu Sun or Donna Vekic would then stand in the way of the final. Navarro, a former NCAA champion, wasn't exactly a favorite entering the tournament but it now seems like a final appearance is well within reach.\n\n3. Jelena Ostapenko: The 2017 French Open champion (and Lil Wayne's favorite player) hasn't reached a major semifinal since Wimbledon in 2018, but looks ready to this week. In her first four matches at the All England Club, Ostapenko hasn't dropped more than five games in a match and her longest outing was just 69 minutes.\n\nOn Monday, against Yulia Putintseva, who upset Swiatek in the third round, Ostapenko continued to display her dominance with a 6-2, 6-3 rout. Ostapenko, the 2014 junior champion at Wimbledon, was candid about how she was feeling about her play after the match.\n\n\"I'm probably more confident and more mature on the court this tournament especially,\" she said. \"I kind of know what I have to do, and I'm doing it quite well, especially in deciding moments. I'm just doing the things that I've been doing before, like when I won [the] French Open, when I was back in top 10. Yeah, I feel like I'm doing those things better than before.\"\n\nBut Ostapenko will face Krejcikova, her first seeded opponent of the tournament and fellow French Open champion, on Wednesday, and that could put her newfound confidence and maturity to the test. If she's able to escape Krejcikova, she could make things interesting against Rybakina in the semifinals.\n\n4. Elina Svitolina: The 2023 Wimbledon surprise semifinalist is having another momentous run this year. She stunned Ons Jabeur, who reached the last two Wimbledon finals, on Saturday in the third round -- needing just 80 minutes for the 6-1, 7-6 (4) victory. And on Monday, she was even more impressive with a resounding 6-2, 6-1 win over Xinyu Wang in under an hour.\n\nShe played the match with a black ribbon pinned to her shirt in memory of the victims of the Russian bombing of a children's hospital in her native Ukraine earlier in the day on Monday. Fighting back tears, she explained it had been \"extremely tough\" to play after such a tragedy.\n\n\"I have to put my head down and show up and do my best, my very best,\" Svitolina said. \"Every Ukrainian is using their own way to raise awareness, to raise money, to help in every possible way they can. My way is through tennis. This is what's really motivated me today to do something. I tried to be focused on my job, tried to be focused on what I can control. Just do what I can in a way.\n\n\"I'm playing, of course, such an amazing event as Wimbledon. I have to also think about how I can use that in a way for Ukrainian people. At least with my win today, it was a small light that brought a happy moment for Ukrainian people.\"\n\n5. Lulu Sun: From relative unknown to Wimbledon quarterfinalist, the 23-year-old from New Zealand is having the tournament of her life in just her second major main draw. The seventh female qualifier in the Open Era to reach the quarterfinals, Sun shocked No. 8 seed Qinwen Zheng 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, for her first victory at a major in the first round and then silenced the Centre Court crowd on Sunday as she defeated British star Emma Raducanu in three sets.\n\nAnd it's not just that she's won, it's how she's done it. Playing an aggressive style of tennis, Sun's 52 winners against Raducanu are the most by any woman all tournament. Her fearless, yet composed, ball-striking and movement could certainly help propel her past Vekic in the quarters and into the semifinals.\n\nA week ago, many people would have said, \"Who?\" when seeing her name, but now, and with every match she plays, she's proving just how dangerous she can be (and how strong the depth of talent is in the women's game). And Sun, who remains relatively unbothered by the newfound attention, said she didn't find her quarterfinal run surprising.\n\n\"Playing all these players up until now, it's just opportunity, a new opportunity each time,\" Sun said on Sunday. \"Yeah, I'm super grateful to be able to play another match here.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors":

However, Alcaraz won their recent meeting in Cincinnati last year, clinching a round of 16 victory in three sets.\n\nWe say: Alcaraz to win in five sets\n\nTuesday's match-up should be fascinating for several reasons as Alcaraz's 11-match winning streak at Wimbledon meets Paul's ongoing nine-match sequence on grass.\n\nThe American has momentum but facing the defending champion is a different challenge entirely. Alcaraz's wont to dip within matches means Paul possibly forces a decider on Tuesday, with the Spaniard expected to continue his sequence of winning extended matches at Slams.\n\nID:547732:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect7312:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major game!", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_brown@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Anthony Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Virtanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Otto Virtanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Draper_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Draper (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Bautista Agut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Mart\u00ednez_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Mart\u00ednez (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vukic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vukic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bublik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Bublik"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/27/carlos-alcaraz_2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The young Spaniard beat Tommy Paul in the quarterfinals and now awaits Daniil Medvedev for a place in the final, to defend the 2023 success.\n\nAt the press conference after the victory against the American, Carlitos recognized the path to follow, which is the one traced over time by the Big 3 Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.\n\n\"I think this is one of the things that the Big 3 have done best throughout their careers: winning even on days when they weren't playing their best tennis,\" he said.\n\nWinning despite the difficulties and bad days. That's what the Spaniard has done in recent matches with extreme determination.\n\n\"I'm very happy to be back in the semifinals of Wimbledon and the level I'm playing. I'm excited to play Daniil Medvedev next Friday. I always try to find solutions, I know I won't play my best tennis in every match. I know there will be matches where I won't be the best version of myself, even if I always try to play it. I think that's one of the things that the Big 3 have done best throughout their careers: winning even on days when they didn't play their best tennis. Even on bad days I managed to reach the level needed to win, I think about that during a match too. When I don't play my best tennis, I try to find the solutions I need to beat my rival. Sometimes it's difficult to do that, you can't always be brilliant,\" he added.\n\nMedvedev praised him for his ability to hit a winner even when he starts from a disadvantage.\n\n\"I'm happy that my opponents think like this, it means that they have to be focused on every shot. It doesn't matter if I'm offensive or defensive, I want them to think that I'm capable of coming back and hitting a winner. Medvedev is special because he can get to every ball. He's like a wall. It's difficult to play with that in mind,\" he explained.\n\nPaul fought and made Alcaraz difficult for much of the match, but surrendered with the score of 7-5, 4-6, 2-6, 2-6. Carlitos, thanks to today's victory, became the third Spaniard to reach the semifinals at the Championships on at least two occasions after Rafael Nadal (8) and Manuel Santana (2). This is his sixth semifinal in a Slam: a statistic that allows him to equal David Ferrer and his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in Spain.\n\nBoth Alcaraz and Paul conceded a high number of chances to their respective rivals in the first set. Alcaraz got the break at 1-1 with an exceptional cross-court forehand but he immediately lost the serve. After saving himself on four occasions in an endless sixth game, the Spaniard failed to take advantage of three other opportunities to move ahead. Paul was perfect and at 6-5 he found a wonderful passing shot on set point. Alcaraz gave up his serve at the start of the second set, but immediately raised his head and began to gain more solidity from every point of view. The decisive thrust came at 3-3, when Paul experienced a serious and prolonged lapse. Three breaks characterized the first phase of the third set: two in favor of Alcaraz and one of Paul. The 21-year-old doubled in the seventh game to close the match. In the fourth set, Alcaraz sent a clear message to Medvedev and all the participants, annihilating Paul with another 6-2.\n\nPersonal side note: Carlitos has a vast arsenal of solutions at his disposal, for every surface. Even if his mind, at times, generates chaos in finding a solution among the many that he has at his disposal, Carlitos has the innate ability to almost always manage to find a way to find the right solution when he really needs it, winning important matches that were actually decided only by details. This is what happened against Tommy Paul.

But we need that new breed.\"\n\nNot only the defending champion here but also the winner of the recent French Open, Alcaraz came into Wimbledon as the bookmakers' favourite.\n\nHe has not been wholly dominant, dropping two sets against Frances Tiafoe in the third round and another against Ugo Humbert in the fourth. But the way he closed out this 6-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory should scare the wits out of his remaining rivals.\n\nAs Paul put it after the match, \"When he starts building energy and building momentum, it feels a little bit different than most of the other guys. He can play some seriously amazing, amazing tennis. Half of the job when you're out there is not to let him win one of those crazy points, because when he does, he kind of gets on a roll.\"\n\nWe could point to so many exquisite moments of creativity and touch: clever passing angles, disguised drop shots, and short slices. But the backhand lob that Alcaraz curled delicately over Paul's head, thus bringing up one of 27 break-point opportunities in the match, was especially perfect.\n\nYou had to feel for Paul, who had snatched the first set with a magnificent flourish of his own: a backhand pass threaded up the line. But it felt like Paul was a souped-up hatchback competing with a Formula One car. No matter how hard he pushed, no matter how desperately he red-lined his engine, Alcaraz always had an extra gear.\n\nAlcaraz alluded to this point in his on-court interview. \"If I'm struggling a little bit to find the solutions, if the opponent is playing great tennis and I don't get him in trouble, I believe at the end that I'll be able to come back and be able to find solutions.\"\n\nAlcaraz also mentioned the length and quality of the first-set rallies, which underlined the movement skills of both players. \"It was kind of like I'm playing on clay,\" he said. \"Over 10, 15 shots every point so I had to stay strong mentally.\"\n\nPaul was not convinced by the clay-court comparison, however. \"it didn't feel super clay courty to me,\" he said. \"I felt like we played some pretty quick points. When I say 'quick', the ball speed was fast. The points were long, but we were kind of hitting laser beams back and forth.\n\n\"He's probably the quickest player. It's very hard to get the ball by him [and] he moves incredible on the grass. It's not easy to change direction the way that he does.\"\n\nThe effect of Alcaraz's uncanny quickness around the court was to ruin Paul's statistics, so that he finished with an ugly combination of 21 winners and 51 unforced errors.\n\nBut if those numbers might suggest that Paul had a shocker, the eye test told us otherwise. He was all over the court, directing the ball with purpose and intensity.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Alcaraz was even more inescapable, moving so quickly that he seemed to pull the ball towards him through some kind of gravitational force.\n\nIn a tournament that has featured more than its share of slips and sprains, it was nerve-racking at times to watch Alcaraz's helter-skelter dashes across the court.

Really happy about the level that I'm playing,\" added Alcaraz, who was still in a crib when American Andy Roddick won the U.S. Open title in 2003.\n\nSinner is another of the men's tour's young guns who was heavily backed to succeed at the grasscourt Grand Slam after his breakthrough Australian Open triumph and a potential encounter with Alcaraz had left fans excited following the draw.\n\nThe ailing 22-year-old came crashing down to earth against fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their Melbourne Park title clash, however, a sobering result that snapped a run of five straight wins over the Russian.\n\nBRAVE FIGHT\n\nSinner put up a brave fight under the Centre Court roof after a timeout due to illness but the Italian was unable to prevent a 6-7(7) 6-4 7-6(4) 2-6 6-3 defeat.\n\n\"This morning I didn't feel great. I had some problems. Then with the fatigue, it was tough,\" said Sinner.\n\n\"But take nothing away from Daniil. He played smart. Played good tennis. That's it ... It wasn't an easy moment.\n\n\"I tried to fight with that what I had today.\"\n\nSinner's compatriot Jasmine Paolini was grinning from ear to ear on the main showcourt after her utterly dominant performance against American 19th seed Emma Navarro later on Tuesday.\n\nThe seventh seed cruised to a 6-2 6-1 victory in 58 minutes on another damp day at Wimbledon to set up a meeting with Croatian Donna Vekic, who ended the extraordinary run of 123rd ranked qualifier Lulu Sun.\n\nVekic had serious doubts about the durability of her knee after surgery in 2021 and considered quitting, but she now finds herself in a maiden semi-final on the grandest stage.\n\n\"Those couple of years were tough,\" said Vekic, reflecting on the period after her surgery.\n\n\"Now, reaching my best result ever at a Grand Slam, I'm really proud of myself, of the work that I've done, of the work that my team has done.\"\n\n(Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar;

In an Instagram post that quickly went viral, Alcaraz executed a stunning forehand drop-shot, reminiscent of the way Federer played out one of his points at Wimbledon 2012.\n\nThis isn't the first time Alcaraz has recreated a Federer moment on the tennis court. So these instances continue to make him lovable among fans of the Swiss maestro.\n\nThe post highlighted two key points. Firstly, there is an uncanny similarity between Alcaraz and Federer's flamboyancy and skill with which they have made the game look so easy.\n\nSecondly, there is a growing sentiment too among fans that Alcaraz is more like Federer than Rafael Nadal, being the 20-time Grand Slam champion's successor.\n\nThe reigning Wimbledon champion's ability to pull off seemingly impossible shots with effortless grace mirrors Federer's style, which has captivated many tennis fans for decades.\n\nNadal, on the other hand, is renowned for his relentless intensity and physical prowess. Alcaraz, although capable of powerful baseline play, often opts for strategic shot-making and instinctive play, much like Federer.\n\nThis affinity for artistic tennis, combined with his poised demeanor on and off the court, aligns him more closely with Federer's legacy than with Nadal's.\n\nAlcaraz has admitted many times that while Nadal is his hero, Federer is his actual boyhood idol of whom he had posters in his bedroom while growing up. Copying the legends can never be wrong. It could also signal a record-breaking career for the 3-time Grand Slam champion, who is just 21 years of age currently.\n\nAlcaraz's ability to replicate Federer's iconic shots not only entertains fans but also shows his future potential. We often remember Federer's behind-the-back flick during the 2012 Wimbledon tournament as a precursor to his eventual victory that year.\n\nFederer pulled off that rally and winner against Andy Murray in the final, much to the delight of the crowd which was supposed to be against him. The 'King of Grass' went on win the title.\n\nAlcaraz's recent display of similar brilliance begs the question: Could this shot be a sign of Alcaraz winning Wimbledon 2024?\n\nThe Spaniard's brilliance on grass continues and the way things stand, he is now a top favorite to defend his title. With Sinner getting knocked out, his chances have only increased. Interestingly, Alcaraz has won 40 out of his last 43 Grand Slam matches.\n\nAnd 2 out of those 3 losses have come against his upcoming opponent, Daniil Medvedev (US Open 2023 semi-final) and his potential opponent in the final, Novak Djokovic (French Open 2023 semi-final).\n\nBut Alcaraz could take inspiration from Federer's 2004 campaign as well, when he defended his 2003 title successfully at the age of 22. The Swiss maestro would be one happy man if the Spaniard pulls off the title defence in a similar manner. Alcaraz takes on Medvedev in the first semi-final on Friday, July 12.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rishika_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rishika Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/03/941cb2a1-untitled-design-16.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 3036, "textEnd": 3043}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Really happy about the level that I'm playing,\" added Alcaraz, who was still in a crib when American Andy Roddick won the U.S. Open title in 2003.\n\nSinner is another of the men's tour's young guns who was heavily backed to succeed at the grasscourt Grand Slam after his breakthrough Australian Open triumph and a potential encounter with Alcaraz had left fans excited following the draw.\n\nThe ailing 22-year-old came crashing down to earth against fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their Melbourne Park title clash, however, a sobering result that snapped a run of five straight wins over the Russian.\n\nBRAVE FIGHT\n\nSinner put up a brave fight under the Centre Court roof after a timeout due to illness but the Italian was unable to prevent a 6-7(7) 6-4 7-6(4) 2-6 6-3 defeat.\n\n\"This morning I didn't feel great.

These are not one-off exhibitions of outrageous skills, these are frequent displays of flair. And their abilities to produce these in all types of courts. Alcaraz is more flamboyant and scripts 'wow' moments with his shot-making while Sinner's big weapon is his logic-defying court coverage. On Sunday at SW19, Sinner came up with a quintessential Alcaraz moment while Alcaraz gave his best impression of Sinner's grit.\n\nAt set point in the 2nd set, Alcaraz managed to return a serve down the middle with a forehand block. Ugo Humbert must have then thought he had the point in the bag when his lefty inside-out forehand had Alcaraz on the run and down on his backside at the baseline. Humbert had a wide open chance to kill the point from the net but the Spaniard had already gotten up and started his sprint to the other flank to hit a backhand lob on the run. It wasn't the greatest of lobs either, and Humbert had another chance to kill the point at the net. He tapped the ball close to the net but Alcaraz was on his bike again, rushing diagonally forward to reach the ball and force Humbert to play another shot. The volley sailed wide and Centre Court erupted. In the post-match chat, Alcaraz described that point as \"unbelievable\".\n\n\"The last time I remember that I fell down and recovered and won the point at the end was against Sinner at the US Open. I remember that I fell down, recovered, and made a passing shot. That is the last time I remember that I got a point like this one,\" Alcaraz said. \"As I said on the court, that's myself fighting for every ball. I think that I can reach every ball. It doesn't matter the shot, the opponent hit, or the place that I'm on the court. I just think that I'm going to get it, I'm going to hit another good shot or a passing shot, believing that I'm going to get the point.\"\n\n'Lucky'\n\nAt Halle, Sinner played two points that roughly fit the description of Alcaraz's never-say-die rally on Sunday. But in his round of 16 tie against Ben Shelton, it was not the hustle in a long rally that got everyone talking... it was a stunning tweener. At 4-5 in the third set, Shelton picked up a serve from the Italian out wide and hit a superb forehand crosscourt return. It came at Sinner awkwardly, and he instinctively spread his legs apart and hit the ball through them. A reaction, shot, basically. Most times tweeners look fancy but are easily returned, but Sinner hit this so well that it almost turned into a perfect drop shot that had Shelton scrambling forward. The American just about got to it but Sinner was now waiting to nail the perfect crosscourt forehand pass past his opponent.\n\nIn a 27-second clip posted by Wimbledon, Sinner tried to explain the shot and basically ended up uttering just about 3-4 words. In the press conference, though, he was a bit more forthcoming. When asked if we will see more of this from him in the future, he shrugged and said, \"I don't think so. I'm not the kind of player to have a lot of trick shots. But in this case, it was still an easier shot, because I didn't have space to go right and left. It was a lucky shot.\" Sometimes, the best make their own luck.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vinayakk_mohanarangan@indianexpress.com", "name": "Vinayakk Mohanarangan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweener_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tweener (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lob (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shelton_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shelton (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halle Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Players", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Alcaraz-and-Sinner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Even the signature drop shots worked seamlessly on grass on the day.\n\nEarlier this year, Alcaraz worked on improving his serve, with the help of coach Juan Carlos Ferrero.\n\nThe improvements are biomechanical changes, involving one, instead of two pauses during his racquet take back, in order to improve the rhythm when striking the ball in motion.\n\nThe technique has paid dividends on Wimbledon's grass, particularly when he has needed it.\n\nOn Sunday he won 63 points on his first serve, while Humbert managed to win 45 first serve points.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz's win was bolstered by his 14 aces, and conversion of six break point opportunities.\n\nAt his post-match press conference at Wimbledon, he was optimistic.\n\n\"It's always great to qualify to the quarter-finals. I'm feeling great on the court. I think I'm getting better and better every match that I'm playing. Feeling really comfortable on the court, hitting good points, good shots\".\n\nWhen asked about some key moments in the match where he had a dip in concentration, Carlos Alcaraz replied: \"There was a certain point that I couldn't find my good read on the serve.

I'm happy to have finished the match before the possible interruption for darkness. We played in strange conditions. In the second set you couldn't see much in one part of the court. I arrived around 09:15 in the morning, spent a lot of time here. Then it started to rain before we went out on the court to warm up.\"\n\nWith these words shared at the press conference, the American Tommy Paul talked about the match won against Roberto Bautista Agut in the 4th round at Wimbledon. Now, one of the most interesting quarterfinals of the Champpionships sees Carlitos Alcaraz face Paul. The American has shown on more than one occasion that he has the tennis to make things difficult for the Spaniard and the two tennis players are perfectly even, in the head-to-head. Two victories for Alcaraz, two for Paul: the American managed to surprise him on both occasions in Canada in the prestigious ATP Masters 1000 event that is held one year in Montreal and one year in Toronto. The Wimbledon semi-finals will be up for grabs on Court 1 of the All England Club.\n\nAt the press conference, Paul analyzed the challenge that will see him oppose the young Spaniard, underlining how he really enjoys playing against Carlitos.\n\n\"The serve is always the most important shot in men's tennis. I will have to serve very well in my next match, but the return will also be important. We both have an aggressive style of play, he is extremely aggressive. He entertains the crowd and it is a lot of fun to play against him if I have to be honest.\"\n\nFinally, Paul expressed a comment on last year's final that saw Alcaraz beat Novak Djokovic in the fifth set at The Championships.\n\n\"Really exciting match. Alcaraz played unbelievably and took the title. It was exciting to watch, I had no idea who was going to win before the match.

to reach Wimbledon semifinals; Sinner toppled by Medvedev - BusinessWorld Online", "body": "LONDON -- Defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz returned to the semifinals with an enthralling comeback on Tuesday but there will be no blockbuster showdown with Jannik Sinner after the world number one was dragged the distance and dumped out.\n\nHaving taken his Grand Slam tally to three at the French Open last month, Mr. Alcaraz pushed on in his quest to retain a major trophy for the first time and cement his big-league status by rallying past American Tommy Paul 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2.\n\nThe clash between the two most recent Queen's Club champions still produced some breathtaking shot-making on Court One before Paul's bid to end a 21-year US wait for a men's Grand Slam champion faded.\n\nMr. Sinner is another of the men's tour's young guns who was heavily backed to succeed at the grasscourt Grand Slam after his breakthrough Australian Open triumph and a potential encounter with Mr. Alcaraz had left fans excited following the draw.\n\nThe ailing 22-year-old came crashing down to earth against fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their Melbourne Park title clash, however, a sobering result that snapped a run of five straight wins over the Russian.\n\nBRAVE FIGHT\n\nMr. Sinner put up a brave fight under the Centre Court roof after a timeout due to illness but the Italian was unable to prevent a 6-7(7) 6-4 7-6(4) 2-6 6-3 defeat.\n\nSinner's compatriot Jasmine Paolini was grinning from ear to ear on the main showcourt after her utterly dominant performance against American 19 seed Emma Navarro later on Tuesday.\n\nThe seventh seed cruised to a 6-2 6-1 victory in 58 minutes on another damp day at Wimbledon to set up a meeting with Croatian Donna Vekic, who ended the extraordinary run of 123 ranked qualifier Lulu Sun.\n\nMs. Vekic had serious doubts about the durability of her knee after surgery in 2021 and considered quitting, but she now finds herself in a maiden semifinal on the grandest stage. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And that is what will be at on 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz's mind ahead of Friday's Alcaraz vs Medvedev men's singles semi-final.\n\nWimbledon is airing for free in some countries. But don't worry if you're on holiday while it's on -- because you can watch Alcaraz vs Medvedev live streams from anywhere with a VPN.\n\nThe Spaniard is already well on his way with three Grand Slams, including last year's Wimbledon Men's singles title, but faces a dogged opponent in 28-year-old Daniil Medvedev, who has enjoyed a reinvigorated run of form since early 2023 and won a five-setter against world number one Jannik Sinner in the quarters.\n\nThe current Wimbledon Champion is 4-2 ahead of the Russian in terms of the head-to-heads, including victory the last time out at Indian Wells. Last year Alcaraz also beat Medvedev in the ATP finals, Indian Wells Masters and, of course, the Wimbledon semi-final.\n\nMedvedev will be drawing from experience he gained in successes over his younger opponent in the US Open 2023 semi-final and Wimbledon in 2021. In all it promises to be a thrilling contest between two men who openly acknowledge each other's talents - Alcaraz referring to Medvedev as \"A wall... I feel like I can hit an unbelievable shot, the ball is going to bounce back\" while Medvedev admits, \"You know whatever shot you hit, he can hit a winner from there.\"\n\nYou won't want to miss the men's singles semi-final so read on to discover where to watch Alcaraz vs Medvedev live streams and catch Wimbledon 2024 from anywhere.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to live in the U.K. then you can watch an Alcaraz vs Medvedev Wimbledon Men's semi-final live stream for free.

Initially, Alcaraz struggled as Paul capitalised on his chances, breaking Alcaraz's serve to take the first set 7-5 and gain an early advantage.\n\nHowever, Alcaraz swiftly turned the tide in his favor. He bounced back in the second set with a decisive break of Paul's serve and held his own serve solidly to level the match.\n\nThe momentum continued to shift in Alcaraz's favour in the third set, where another crucial break allowed him to assert control. Paul found it increasingly difficult to regain momentum against Alcaraz's confident play.\n\nBy the fourth set, Alcaraz had settled into a dominant rhythm while Paul appeared to struggle with confidence. The Spaniard maintained his composure and secured the match convincingly with a strong performance in the fourth set.\n\nAlcaraz's victory sets up an exciting semifinal clash with Daniil Medvedev, who advanced after defeating top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the quarter-finals.

Both men had to come back from a set down to win in the quarters, with Medvedev doing so over a dramatic five-setter against world number one Jannik Sinner.\n\nFor Medvedev, it is about avenging himself against the same man who knocked him out at the same stage in 2023. Alcaraz is growing from strength to strength throughout the tournament, and after defeating American Tommy Paul 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2 in the last round, the third seed will fancy his chances to return to the final.\n\nIn the other semi-final, Italy's Lorenzo Musetti will take on seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic on Centre Court. Musetti, another 22-year-old Italian like Sinner, progressed to his first semi at SW19 in London after defeating the American Fritz 3-6 7-6(5) 6-2 3-6 6-1 on Wednesday (10 July).\n\nDjokovic made it through his quarter-final without hitting a ball, as Australian Alex de Minaur had to withdraw due to an injury sustained on his match-winning point in the previous round. The Serbian star had been recovering from a meniscus injury suffered at the French Open, but is now a game away from his sixth straight Wimbledon final - and a potential record-setting 25th major win.", "source": {"uri": "olympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Olympics.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nischal_schwager_patel@olympics.com", "name": "Nischal Schwager-Patel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.olympics.com/images/image/private/t_social_share_thumb/f_auto/primary/yqr3getggidviuapvyq5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1062, "textEnd": 1069}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

This would leave him just 410 points adrift of Sinner.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who was a runner-up at Wimbledon a year ago, will gain 100 points if he loses in the final again this year as the amount of points earned for Grand Slam finalists increased from 1,200 to 1,300 ahead of this season. If Djokovic falls in the semi-finals, he will drop to 7,960 points.\n\nAlcaraz, who was third in the ATP Rankings prior to Wimbledon, is the defending champion, which means he cannot increase his points tally.\n\nThe Spaniard could, though, cut the gap to both Sinner and Djokovic if he successfully defends his crown -- an outcome that would see him remain on 8,130 points. Winning the title would take Alcaraz above Djokovic into the No 2 spot if the Serbian were to lose in the last four.\n\nThe 21-year-old will be left with 7,430 points and stay in third position if he is a runner-up, but he would slip to fourth place if he loses in the semi-finals.\n\nA last four exit would leave Alcaraz on 6,930 points and allow Alexander Zverev to leapfrog him into the world No 3 spot as the German will climb to 7,015 points following his run to the last 16.\n\nWinner - 2000 points\n\nRunner-up - 1300 points\n\nSemi-finals - 800 points\n\nQuarter-finals - 400 points\n\nRound of 16 - 200 points\n\nRound of 32 - 100 points\n\nRound of 64 - 50 points\n\nRound of 128 - 10 points", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_west@tennis365.com", "name": "Ewan West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F10140018%2FJannik-Sinner-Novak-Djokovic-and-Carlos-Alcaraz-Wimbledon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

"Jannik Sinner, Lorenzo Musetti, and Alex de Minaur are all rankings winners from Wimbledon.\n\nWe are just days away from discovering who will be Wimbledon men's singles champion in 2024.\n\nOne semi-final is a 2023 rematch between fifth seed Daniil Medvedev and reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz, while surprise semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti takes on seven-time winner Novak Djokovic.\n\nThere are still plenty of ranking permutations that could take place, though we can already get a sense of what will happen when the rankings update on Monday.\n\nWe look at the biggest winners and losers from the men's event at Wimbledon.\n\n1) Jannik Sinner - 9,890\n\n2) Novak Djokovic - 8,360\n\n3) Carlos Alcaraz - 8.130\n\n4) Alexander Zverev - 6,905\n\n5) Daniil Medvedev - 6,445\n\n6) Andrey Rublev - 4,420\n\n7) Hubert Hurkacz - 4,235\n\n8) Casper Ruud - 4,025\n\n9) Alex de Minaur - 3,820\n\n10) Grigor Dimitrov - 3,750\n\nWith fewer points to defend than Djokovic or Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner was practically set to stay as world No 1 no matter what happened at the tournament.\n\nHowever, the 2o23 champion and finalist knew they would have to embark on deep runs, with Medvedev and Alexander Zverev not too far behind.\n\nBehind those five, the chasing pack are all fairly close together.\n\nThere was little to separate any player ranked from sixth (Andrey Rublev pre-tournament) down to around 12th or 13th, and movement was always likely.\n\nWhat Jannik Sinner's Wimbledon exit means for ATP Rankings as Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz could benefit\n\nPersistent Novak Djokovic critic Adriano Panatta's most controversial quotes about the tennis great\n\nJohn McEnroe names two players who could replace Novak Djokovic to rival Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner\n\n1) Jannik Sinner - 9,570\n\n2) Novak Djokovic - 7,960 (Live)\n\n3) Alexander Zverev - 7,015\n\n4) Carlos Alcaraz - 6,930 (Live)\n\n5) Daniil Medvedev - 6,525 (Live)\n\n6) Alex de Minaur - 4,185\n\n7) Hubert Hurkacz - 4,105\n\n8) Andrey Rublev - 4,070\n\n9) Casper Ruud - 4,030\n\n10) Grigor Dimitrov - 3,770\n\nDespite a disappointing quarter-final exit to Medvedev, Sinner will still have a comfortable cushion as the world No 1 next week.\n\nThe only play who can significantly close the gap is world No 2 Djokovic, who will move up to 9,160 points should he capture a record-equalling eighth title on Sunday.\n\nHowever, the Serbian needs to win his semi-final against Musetti to ensure he stays at world No 2; should he lose that match, Alcaraz can overtake him by defending his title.\n\nAlcaraz needs to win his semi-final to maintain his world No 3 ranking ahead of Zverev, while Medvedev will go up to world No 3 ahead of both if he captures his second Grand Slam this week.\n\nLower down the top 10, Wimbledon ended in heartbreaking fashion for Alex de Minaur, but the Australian is ensured of a new career-high of sixth come Monday.\n\nElsewhere, Musetti's run to a first major semi-final has propelled him back into the top 20, with the Italian rising nine spots in the live rankings to world No 16.\n\nHe will be ranked 14th if he reaches the final, and 13th with a maiden Slam title.\n\nSetting new career highs in the top 30 are Jack Draper and Arthur Fils, the pair set to jump to 26th and 28th respectively.\n\nGiovanni Mpetshi Perricard is primed to leap up 14 places to a new career-high of 44th after reaching the second week as a lucky loser, while Brandon Nakashima and Emil Ruusuvuori are set for big jumps.\n\nMeanwhile, tour veteran Roberto Bautista Agut is set to move up 37 spots, the former semi-finalist returning to the top 100 after reaching round four.\n\nLorenzo Musetti credits one big break for turning the tide in epic battle with Taylor Fritz\n\nWTA Rankings Winners And Losers Wimbledon: Jasmine Paolini top 5, Sonay Kartal, +108, Lulu Sun +70, Emma Raducanu +41\n\nNo one has suffered a dip down the ATP Rankings as significant as Christopher Eubanks, with the American losing in round one - a year after reaching the last eight.\n\nThe US star has had a poor season to date, and an early exit sees him fall a staggering 66 spots and crash outside the top 100, projected to be world No 128 next week.\n\nAlso suffering a significant dip down the rankings is Matteo Berrettini, who was the victim of a tough round two draw against Sinner.\n\n2021 finalist Berrettini had restored his ranking inside the top 60 pre-Wimbledon, though is set to fall 23 spots to world No 82 after failing to defend round four points.\n\nWithin the top 10, Rublev will fall two spots to world No 8, while just further down Stefanos Tsitsipas will drop one place to world No 12.\n\n2023 quarter-finalist Roman Safiullin is set to fall 23 places to world No 67 after failing to defend those points, while David Goffin will fall 15 places to world No 98 after a round one exit.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Carlos, could you describe your emotions coming back here to this hallowed turf, but this time as champion?\n\nA: Well, it's special to be back at Wimbledon, a bit more special as a defending champion. I'm trying not to think too much about it. I'm just here to achieve the same result as last year, so I have to be really focused every day in every practice and try to stay away from the emotions and the run that I had last year, just if I want to do the same.\n\nRELATED: Wimbledon 2024: Tennis theatrics keep capacity crowd riveted as Alcaraz has last laugh against Humbert\n\nQ. How do you go from clay courts to grass courts? Do you do something special with the rackets when you change surfaces?\n\nA: Not really. I just play with the same racket; I don't do anything different to it. Honestly, I don't like changes during the season, so I stay with the same racket.\n\nQ. How do you feel now with the forehand finally without the protection, playing freely with your Babolat racket?\n\nA: I feel like I didn't have any injury in the arm. I can play with freedom in the tournaments and on the court. I can hit my forehand 100% without thinking about it. It was a great effort with my team and myself. I'm really happy about it. It was difficult during the clay season, but I didn't change anything. Coming here, I still didn't change anything, but now I feel freedom.\n\nQ. Did you start playing with Babolat because of Rafa?\n\nA: Not really. Honestly, I don't know why I started playing with Babolat, but once I tried it, I've never changed.\n\nAlcaraz plays a forehand using a Babolat at the Wimbledon Championships 2024 in London, England. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nAlcaraz plays a forehand using a Babolat at the Wimbledon Championships 2024 in London, England. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nQ. What have you been doing in the last week or 10 days since you lost at Queen's? How have you been spending your time, and who have you been practicing with to stay in shape for Monday?\n\nA: I've been practicing, doing physical work, and supporting Spain in the Euros.

I'll take all the support I can get.\n\n\"But I do feel very loved here, I must say. I always love coming here to Wimbledon and playing here. I always feel like I play some of my best tennis. Over the years, I feel like the support I've had has grown significantly.\n\n\"It's a great feeling as a player to know you've got a lot of people in that stadium backing you, having your back when essentially you're so far away from home.\"\n\nNow a top-10 player, his run to the quarter-finals at the All England Club is his best ever showing and he now faces the daunting task of taking down a seven-time champion in Djokovic.\n\nOf that challenge, he said: \"He's obviously achieved greatness many, many years so he's going to be a tough battle. But the type of battles that I want to be playing. Those are the challenges that I want to take advantage of and go out there and show what I can do.\"\n\nDe Minaur pulled up on the very last point of his match with Arthur Fils in the last round with a hip problem but downplayed the severity of the issue.\n\nDjokovic, meanwhile, has shown no ill effects of knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus during the French Open. And the pair will battle it out for a semi-final spot against the winner of either Lorenzo Musetti, the Queen's runner-up, and Taylor Fritz.\n\nThe other last four encounter will see a match-up between defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev after the latter downed a poorly Jannik Sinner in five sets.\n\nSinner said he had woken up feeling sick and, while he didn't vomit, had to come off court at one point feeling ill. \"I took some time because I was dizzy quite a lot,\" he said. \"When I went back, I tried my best. But nothing to take away from Daniil, I think he played very smart\"\n\nMedvedev, meanwhile, said: \"For me, what was important today is I lost [the last] five times to him. It was important to just show I'm always going to be there, I'm always going to fight, I'm always going to try to make your life difficult.\"\n\nIt sets up a repeat of last year's semi-final against Alcaraz, who admitted post-match he was somewhat distracted by Spain's own Euros semi-final against France in Germany.\n\nAlcaraz struggled for much of his match against Tommy Paul but still found a way to win in four sets and make the last four for the second successive time.\n\nFollowing a relatively scrappy victory, the Spaniard said: \"It's going to be really difficult to play my best tennis every match. I know that there are going to be some matches that I'm not going to find my best tennis even though I have to try to win it.\n\n\"I think what the big three did along their career, they are not going to play their best tennis. When I'm not playing my best tennis, I'm going to try to find solutions just to be a bit better, just to beat my opponent.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Boulter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Boulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Fils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Fils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/b3d6a27335c3ae38d250ec0027b63721", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Really happy about the level that I'm playing,\" added Alcaraz, who was still in a crib when American Andy Roddick won the U.S. Open title in 2003.\n\nSinner is another of the men's tour's young guns who was heavily backed to succeed at the grasscourt Grand Slam after his breakthrough Australian Open triumph and a potential encounter with Alcaraz had left fans excited following the draw.\n\nThe ailing 22-year-old came crashing down to earth against fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their Melbourne Park title clash, however, a sobering result that snapped a run of five straight wins over the Russian.\n\nSinner put up a brave fight under the Centre Court roof after a timeout due to illness but the Italian was unable to prevent a 6-7(7) 6-4 7-6(4) 2-6 6-3 defeat.\n\n\"This morning I didn't feel great.

Since then, he smashed the Russian for the loss of only three games in Miami.\n\nThis will be their first grasscourt meeting but I hardly think that helps Medvedev.\n\nHe will have been happy with the way his tournament has gone so far, yet you have to question if he's going to be able to turn the tide against Sinner on this surface.\n\nSinner was completely unfazed by Shelton's big serve the other day and while Medvedev has more to his game, I don't see him being able to stem the Italian's assault.\n\nI'm tempted here by the 3-0 scoreline, although I'm always rather wary of getting involved with that bet on grass where one bad service game can see a set slip by.\n\nIf you are looking for a bet on this one, Sinner in straight sets at 8/5 is the suggestion, although it's not one I'm going to officially put up.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz v Tommy Paul\n\nI think this match could be closer than the odds suggest - Paul is a 3/1 outsider.\n\nThe pair's previous meetings have tended to be very hard fought and the head-to-head stands at 2-2 heading into this one.\n\nPaul has twice beaten Alcaraz on a hardcourt - both times at the Canadian Masters - and was just a tie-break away from another victory when they last met in Cincinnati last summer.\n\nThe route to success was highlighted by the American after his win in Toronto last August after which he said: \"You can't start any points on your heels against him or he'll take advantage of that. So, you really have to go after your shots early in the rally and I was feeling really good on the first-strike tennis.\"\n\nAggression from Paul can be expected again here and he looks in the form to execute the gameplan well.\n\nAfter winning at Queen's Club, Paul took a couple of rounds to get into his stride in SW19 but he's improved with time and has beaten Alexander Bublik and Roberto Bautista Agut without dropping a set in the past few days.\n\nAlcaraz has endured more of a struggle, needing five sets to take down Frances Tiafoe and four to beat Ugo Humbert.\n\nBoth men had aggressive tactics and managed to rattle the Spaniard for periods, albeit not for long enough.\n\nI'm keen to get with Paul in some way here and my initial thought was Alcaraz to win and both players to win a set at around 6/5.\n\nYet I've more than a sneaky suspicion that Paul could land the upset here, although I'm sill not prepared to go completely against a player I fancied for the title before a ball was hit.\n\nThe compromise position is to side with Paul on the handicap where he's getting a 5.5-game start.\n\nClearly, he should land this if he manages to win the match but it also gives us plenty of hope if, as I'd expect, he manages to claim a set.\n\nNone of the 11 sets these two have played has been won easier than 6-3 with four of them being decided by a tie-break; expect another closely-fought contest.\n\nI've not got a bet in this one but I'm going to use it to point out our outright position.\n\nFollowers of my outright preview will have Navarro at 20/1 to win her quarter - a bet which will land if she justifies favouritism in this match.\n\nNavarro was an impressive victor over Coco Gauff in the last round, although the second seed's forehand once again let her down a lot.", "source": {"uri": "sportinglife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shelton_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shelton (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Berrettini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matteo Berrettini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miomir_Kecmanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miomir Kecmanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Humbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ugo Humbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frances Tiafoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Bautista Agut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen's Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bublik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Bublik"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sportinglife.com/images/news/1260x709/47c9af14-0902-48c4-a3e1-d6290b60a88a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Ferrero, who has coached the No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings for a number of years, is in no doubt about what those numbers mean and he is asking for prudence as Alcaraz bids to defend his Wimbledon title.\n\n\"They are very significant stats, but you have to take it day by day, this isn't a given,\" warned Ferrero. \"Then we have to go to the US Open and do everything again to try and reach these kinds of rounds. The most important thing is that he has a very, very high natural level and really in five-set matches his opponents have to play very well to beat him if he's at a normal level.\n\n\"He's feeling very good. He's grown into it against tough players. [Frances] Tiafoe and [Tommy] Paul are difficult. He feels good and he's managed to solve the problems that he's faced, but now we're very focused on the match with Medvedev, not thinking about the title.\n\n'We can't think much beyond Friday because that would be a mistake. Medvedev has earned the respect of all the players. So we're approaching it with the utmost concern.\"\n\nAlcaraz leads Medvedev 4-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having beaten the 2021 US Open champion last year in the same round of Wimbledon, where they will meet on Friday. However, \"Daniil beat us later in the semis at the US Open,\" remembers Ferrero. \"That says a lot about him. He is unaffected by defeats, they help him improve. I'm sure he'll try something different from last year on Friday. Of course, previous matches have an influence, but every match is different...\n\n\"I think you have to learn a lot from the matches you lose because they hurt a little more and you have to pay more attention. Although you can't forget this when you win either, the things you did badly or need to improve on. I always remind him of that.\"\n\nThe fact that Alcaraz has reached six semi-finals in the last seven majors is a clear sign of how important the events are to the Murcia native, who won the 2022 US Open, last year's Wimbledon and Roland Garros a month ago.\n\n\"The motivation comes with playing in a Grand Slam,\" said Ferrero. \"They are the tournaments that motivate you the most, they're the ones you want to win. It's clear that being away from home for a time... you have to know how to handle that monotony. Freshness is very important for Carlos because of his type of physique, because he's very explosive.\"\n\nWith one eye on that freshness, Alcaraz practised on Wednesday on the courts of Aorangi Park, but he'll be playing golf in the afternoon and resting on Thursday before returning to the courts on Friday for his semi-final clash.\n\n\"Nothing is a given, [Spanish motorcycle racer] Marc M\u00e1rquez is a perfect example. What happened to him... he was winning everything, he got an injury and now he hasn't won for over 1,000 days,\" Ferrero said. \"He's battling to come back now, a guy who is an absolute one-off. Problems can happen, you [can't] be too confident, you have to keep working. I think people have got used to him being up there, perhaps what he's doing is even underappreciated.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ferrero", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Ferrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_M\u00e1rquez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc M\u00e1rquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murcia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Murcia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/07/10/16/44/ferrero-alcaraz-wimbledon-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713723", "eventUri": "eng-9713723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

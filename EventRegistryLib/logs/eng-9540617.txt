What does that mean for #MeToo?", "body": "Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein will face a new trial on sex crimes charges, prosecutors in New York City revealed on Wednesday, one week after the state's highest court overturned his previous rape conviction.\n\nIn 2017, accusations of sexual abuse against Weinstein, once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, helped turn the #MeToo movement into a massive cultural force that inspired women across the country to speak out against abuse and harassment they routinely face -- along with the systems that allowed that mistreatment to go unchecked.\n\nRoughly 100 women have accused Weinstein of some form of sexual misconduct, including using his powerful position in the film industry to coerce them into sex, unsolicited sexual advances and rape. Weinstein denies all of these allegations. In 2020, he was found guilty on two counts of sexual assault in New York and sentenced to 23 years in prison.\n\nBut last week, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that those convictions must be thrown out on the grounds that he had not had a fair trial. In a narrow 4-3 decision, the court found that the judge had allowed impermissible testimony from women who had accused Weinstein of assault, but weren't in any way connected to the incidents at the center of the trial. In the view of the appeals court judges, that testimony violated a well-established legal principle that essentially states that defendants must only be judged on the specific acts they've been charged with, not their general behavior.\n\nThe court's decision does not mean Weinstein, who is facing serious health issues, will walk free. He's expected to remain in custody ahead of the new trial. Weinstein also faces a 16-year sentence for rape in California, which was not affected by the ruling in New York.\n\nWhile many legal analysts believe the court's reasoning for throwing out Weinstein's conviction was correct on the merits, the decision still came as a stunning blow to his accusers and supporters of the #MeToo movement more broadly.\n\n\"This ... is an act of institutional betrayal,\" said actor Ashley Judd, who was among the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct. In the eyes of many commentators, the overturned conviction shows that, despite the massive \"reckoning\" that consumed the country several years ago, the structures that allow powerful men to victimize women are still very much in place. Some also expressed concern that the ruling will make it harder to hold abusers accountable by limiting prosecutors' ability to establish a \"pattern of behavior\" that is often needed to overcome the \"credibility gap\" that individual accusers often face.\n\nBut others are more hopeful. They argue that one case, tossed out on what many see as justifiable procedural grounds, in no way invalidates the transformative influence the #MeToo movement has had on our culture. \"When survivors everywhere broke their silence in 2017, the world changed,\" the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein survivors, wrote in a statement. Some add that the ultimate purpose of #MeToo was never to put one man behind bars, but to shed light on the pervasive treatment of women across our society and push our culture toward a consensus that sexual victimization should not be tolerated -- goals they argue the movement has unequivocally accomplished.\n\nWeinstein's next hearing in New York is scheduled for the end of this month and prosecutors say the retrial could begin as soon as September. Weinstein's lawyers are also appealing his California conviction. But California law expressly allows the exact kind of testimony that was ruled inadmissible in New York, making their odds of success much slimmer, legal experts say.\n\nThis case makes clear that the power structures #MeToo aimed to dismantle are still standing\n\n\"For a moment, it seemed like there was a possibility for real change -- that survivors were going to be listened to, whether in the courtroom or in our daily lives. Instead, our reality is that these wins will be short-lived. ... All that this proves is that with enough money and the drive to keep going, justice will bend in your favor.\" -- Sara Peque\u00f1o, USA Today\n\nNothing about this case changes what the movement has accomplished\n\n\"Because the brave women in this case broke their silence, millions and millions and millions of others found the strength to come forward and do the same. That will always be the victory. This doesn't change that. And the people who abuse their power and privilege to violate and harm others will always be the villain. This doesn't change that.\" -- Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement\n\nThis ruling makes it harder for women to come forward and expect justice\n\n\"The overturning of Weinstein's conviction sends a disheartening message that even when survivors find the courage to speak out and a jury finds their abuser guilty, their voices can still be silenced, and their experiences called into question. Even years later, even after it seemed like the hard part was over. In other words, it's never over.\" -- Laura Sinko, Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nWeinstein's legal victory is a major win for the anti-#MeToo backlash\n\n\"His overturned conviction is a symbolic milestone, a marker of the dramatic re-entrenchment of legal and institutional misogyny in our own era, and a reminder of how horribly the feminist ambitions of the late-2010s have been betrayed.\" -- Moira Donegan, Guardian\n\nNothing can derail the progress that the movement is still working toward\n\n\"Every time there's a setback, we hear the same thing: that people will not come forward now. And every time they do. ... This effort to end sexual violence is something that is ongoing, [and] we can't unsee the things that we've seen.\" -- Anita Hill, professor of social policy and law at Brandeis University, to Vanity Fair\n\nIt may not feel like it right now, but things really have gotten better\n\n\"For survivors who continue to confront high barriers to belief, it might well feel like the system is destined not to deliver justice. Yet there is reason to believe in the promise of accountability. As collective understandings of sexual misconduct evolve, so too does our ability to fairly judge the credibility of accusers. Although progress is halting and maddeningly slow, trials such as Weinstein's help bust the myth of the perfect victim.\" -- Deborah Tuerkheimer, CNN\n\nAbusers deserve to be punished, but warping the justice system is not the way to get there\n\n\"Even bad men deserve justice, even creeps like Harvey Weinstein. The justice system cannot be a casualty of women's just wrath at the past sins of powerful men.\" -- Melanie McDonagh, Evening Standard\n\nThis case highlights how the law is lagging behind our culture when it comes to sexual abuse\n\n\"Put bluntly: Our court system has not fully caught up to culture when it comes to understanding sexual violence.\" -- Jessica Bennett, New York Times",

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nBy Jocelyn Noveck\n\nassociated press\n\nNEW YORK -- #MeToo founder Tarana Burke has heard it before. Every time there's a legal setback, the movement is declared dead in the water. A legal success, and presto, it's alive again.\n\nSo Burke, who nearly two decades ago coined the phrase \"Me too\" from her work with sexual assault survivors, found herself again declaring after New York's highest court on Thursday overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction: The #MeToo reckoning is greater than any court case. It's still there, and it's working.\n\nThe most obvious proof, Burke said: \"Ten years ago we could not get a man like Harvey Weinstein into the courtroom.\" The movement, she said, was responsible for that huge cultural shift -- regardless of the Hollywood mogul's ultimate legal fate.\n\nAlso seeking to take the long view, following a legal setback that stunned many survivors and advocates, was Anita Hill, who famously testified against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, becoming the face of the fight against sexual harassment more than a quarter-century before the Weinstein case launched the #MeToo movement.\n\nAlongside her academic career, Hill now heads the Hollywood Commission, which seeks to fight harassment in the entertainment industry. She sought on Thursday to reassure survivors that progress is real.\n\n\"I want those who are saddened by the New York Court of Appeal's decision to know that no single legal ruling can ever match the tremendous progress we have made together in the movement against sexual violence,\" Hill told The Associated Press in an email.\n\n\"The movement will persist,\" she added, \"driven by the truth of our testimonies. And changes to our systems and culture will follow.\"\n\nIt was, of course, a rough morning for sexual assault survivors across the country, as Burke acknowledged at a hastily arranged Manhattan news conference following the court ruling with activists including Ashley Judd, one of the earliest Weinstein accusers.\n\nIn what Judd called \"an act of institutional betrayal,\" New York's highest court, in a 4-3 decision, ordered a new trial, saying the first one had prejudiced Weinstein, 72, with improper rulings, including letting some accusers testify about allegations that weren't part of the case. Weinstein will remain in prison, however, because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape.\n\nAmong those who testified in New York was Dawn Dunning, a supporting witness, who told the court how during a business meeting Weinstein slid his hand up under her skirt and fondled her genitals.\n\nDunning told the AP through her attorney, prominent #MeToo lawyer Debra Katz, that she was \"shocked\" by Thursday's ruling and dealing with a range of emotions, including asking herself, \"Was it all for naught?\"\n\n\"It took two years of my life,\" Dunning said. \"I had to live through it every day. I had to live through the terror of confronting Weinstein. But would I do it again? Yes.\"\n\nShe said that in confronting the producer, she had faced her worst fear and realized he had no power over her. And she was proud that her testimony helped other women earn some justice.\n\nKatz said she had spoken to Dunning and other accusers -- women who felt \"gutted\" -- reminding them of the important role they'd played in the broader reckoning against sexual abuse and violence.\n\n\"They testified at great personal cost. ... It was life-altering for them,\" Katz said. \"And to feel like this was maybe all for naught is a very, very, bad feeling.\"\n\nStill, Katz felt certain Weinstein would be convicted in a new trial.\n\n\"Their testimony was invalidated by the court today due to legal technicalities,\" Katz said. But \"no one doubted the truth of what they testified to, or the courage of their testimony. And so while this is a setback in this case, I do believe that their testimony changed the world.\"\n\nThe testimony fundamentally altered how people view and react to issues of sexual assault in the workplace, she said.\n\n\"And their courage has grown beyond this case -- people continue to come forward, people continue to support other victims who've reported sexual assault and violence, and I truly believe there's no going back from that,\" Katz said.\n\nEchoing that view was Erika Rosenbaum, a Montreal actor who came forward with her own accusations against Weinstein in 2017, and has spent the years since then speaking to groups, especially young people, about sexual harassment and abuse.\n\n\"If anything, I feel like (#MeToo) is a movement that gets stronger all the time,\" Rosenbaum said in an interview. \"It is very much a movement of incremental steps and sharing of stories and holding each other up. And that does not change with a court decision ... Because this is very much a change of of culture. There are ups and downs, there are battles. But this is something that will keep going.\"\n\nLike her, many advocates saw the moment, however dispiriting, as an opportunity to call for a renewal of efforts to push the #MeToo message forward.\n\n\"Today's decision does not erase the truth of what happened,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, head of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. It's important to remember, she said, \"that one well known case does not define this movement. We are a force.\"\n\nGraves noted the fund has provided support for some 9,000 people with sexual harassment complaints since 2018, and has funded 300 lawsuits. The fund is run by the National Women's Law Center in Washington; the broader Hollywood-based group, launched in 2017, shifted all its resources to the fund in January 2023.\n\nBurke stressed in an interview that while legal advances are necessary for progress, \"the judicial system has never been a friend of survivors. And so it's the reason why we need movements, because movements have historically been what has pushed the legal system to do the right thing.\"\n\nBurke said she spent the morning speaking to accusers, including actor Annabella Sciorra, who testified at the 2020 trial that Weinstein raped her.\n\n\"I can understand how devastating and disgusted and angry, just the range of emotions that so many of them must feel,\" Burke said. \"And I hope they understand for those of us survivors who will likely never see a day in court, that they are still heroes to us.\"\n\nBurke, who has spoken out about her own past as a survivor of abuse, added she could never imagine facing her own perpetrator in court.\n\n\"So just the fact that they got to do that, to bring a person, a man like Harvey Weinstein to account for his crimes, is incredible,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "philasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Sunday Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The decision will create a chilling effect for both prosecutors and survivors who seek justice from the criminal system. Weinstein remains in prison for a California conviction, yet that decision is also being appealed.\n\nIt is ironic at best that, in a case that inspired millions of women to speak openly about unreported sexual assaults - crimes they never sought justice for in large part because of our unresponsive, broken system - the court overturned this conviction on the grounds that jurors would not need additional testimony because they could get it right without it.\n\nDespite the public outcry, prosecuting Weinstein was not easy. Sex crimes are notoriously difficult to prosecute because of widespread myths about rape, and Weinstein's case had the potential to recall many of our most ingrained stereotypes about sexual violence.\n\nThe assaults were between acquaintances instead of strangers. Many of the victims continued to stay in touch with Weinstein, including one victim who later had a consensual relationship with him. These facts are hard for the average juror to understand. Many people still think rape usually involves a stranger in an alley, a victim who fights her perpetrator and is left with visible injuries. This is not the case, but the reality remains: very few incidents of sexual assault lead to a conviction.\n\nThe Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN) estimates that out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, only 310 are reported to police, 50 lead to an arrest and 28 lead to a felony conviction. That's less than 3%. In Chicago, research done by my team at the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation found just 10% to 20% of sexual assaults reported to Chicago police have led to arrests.\n\nNew York law prohibits evidence of uncharged \"prior bad acts\" by defendants unless it is for a specific purpose; it cannot be included at trial only to show a defendant has a high likelihood to commit the crime. When courts decide whether to admit evidence of prior bad acts, they must consider if it will suggest to jurors that the defendant is more likely to have committed the charged offense because he did something similar in the past, which New York considers to be unfair to defendants.\n\nNew York does allow prior bad acts to show a defendant's intent. The Manhattan trial judge allowed prosecutors to introduce additional witnesses who were victimised by Weinstein, but whose cases were never charged to show Weinstein's intent to commit sexual assault and that he could not have mistaken the acts as consensual. Weinstein's defence repeatedly suggested the victims were actually the ones \"manipulating\" Weinstein into believing consensual sex would happen because the victims were in contact with him and agreed to go to hotel rooms with him. The additional witnesses' testimony was crucial information that went to a central issue in the case: whether these encounters were consensual or whether they were truly sexual assault.\n\nBut the high court believed these additional witnesses were not needed to show that Weinstein intended to sexually assault the victims. The court reasoned if the jury believed the victims' testimony that they said \"no\" and attempted to resist Weinstein, \"no reasonable person would understand such behavior as having communicated anything other than their rejection of sexual activity.\"\n\nI would like to live in the world that the New York Court of Appeals describes, a world where people genuinely believe survivors. We do not. After a decade of legal advocacy for sexual assault survivors, I am convinced the high court dramatically underestimated the complexity of sexual assault cases and overestimated how \"reasonable people\" interpret sexual advances, particularly where massive power imbalances exist. The jury could believe the victims' testimony and still think Weinstein thought he was engaging in consensual sex, although the court naively dismisses this possibility as \"inconceivable.\" In fact, that outcome was entirely likely given the defence's questioning, so the majority's conclusion that the additional testimony was \"irrelevant\" is inexplicable.\n\nOur culture routinely gives men who cause harm the benefit of the doubt - that they were simply confused or there were mixed signals or that they truly thought something was consensual. I see it every day in my work.\n\nBy overturning Weinstein's conviction, the court sends a powerful signal. Survivors will be more reluctant than ever to report sexual assault cases. They might reasonably ask: If even someone as monstrous as Weinstein was not convicted, how could they possibly hope for justice in their case? Prosecutors who were reluctant to charge difficult cases will now be less likely to proceed, even with multiple victims speaking out.\n\nAfter witnessing the reversal of Weinstein's conviction, in part due to use of testimony from victims whose cases were never charged, prosecutors locally and nationally will be reluctant to use this once-powerful evidentiary tool of \"prior bad acts,\" even in the most clear-cut cases, with devastating consequences for survivors. -- Chicago Tribune/TNS", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex and the law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape,_Abuse_&_Incest_National_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/05/05/2677545.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540617", "eventUri": "eng-9540617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Last Thursday, the 2020 conviction of Harvey Weinstein for rape and sexual assault was overturned by the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Hollywood producer's trial had been a \"symbolic milestone\": after accusations were made against him in 2017, more than 100 women came forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault and rape. Their stories sparked the global #MeToo reckoning and led, eventually, to his conviction.\n\nThe new ruling doesn't mean that Weinstein will walk free; he was also convicted of rape in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in jail. But it does seem like a shocking reversal, an indication that the gains of #MeToo are being lost.\n\nThe truth is that the criminal case against him \"has been fragile since the day it was filed\", said Jodi Kantor in The New York Times. New York prosecutors made \"a series of gambles\", and ultimately they did not pay off.\n\nWhile Weinstein's alleged victims \"could fill an entire courtroom\", only two of them could support a New York criminal trial. (Many of the accusations were of sexual harassment, which is a civil violation, not a criminal one; most did not take place in New York; others fell beyond the statute of limitations.) So prosecutors put a number of women on the stand as so-called \"prior bad act\" witnesses, to \"establish a pattern of predation\".\n\nBut New York law in this area is complex, and the move risked violating a cardinal rule of criminal trials: \"defendants must be judged on the acts they are being charged with\".\n\nThe appeal court made the right decision, said Melanie McDonagh in the Evening Standard. Weinstein's lawyers argued successfully that the trial was flooded with \"irrelevant\" evidence. People are \"entitled to due process\". Even \"creeps like Weinstein\" are \"innocent until proved guilty\".\n\nYet the ruling \"highlighted the striking gap between how we've come to believe women inside the courtroom and outside it\", said Jessica Bennett in The New York Times.\n\nThe difficulty with prosecuting sex crimes is that they generally have few witnesses, and come down to \"he said, she said\". #MeToo seemed to offer a way round that: an \"army of voices\" could be assembled to show a pattern of offending, to support individual women's testimony. In other states, prosecutors are given more latitude.\n\nThe case will \"revive debate about whether the rules for such convictions need to be updated\".", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Kantor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodi Kantor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Evening_Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Evening Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCCDpcgCzvhZybmrRYd8Q3-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540617", "eventUri": "eng-9540617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Manhattan's district attorney says he wants to retry Weinstein, but that seems, at most, a maybe.\n\nThe former film producer still has a long sentence to serve in Los Angeles, although this month he is expected to appeal that conviction on grounds similar to those that were successful in New York. His lawyer is the same one who got Bill Cosby's conviction tossed out.\n\nMany of Weinstein's accusers say they are horrified. Even some of the seven judges who participated in the decision were outraged. The majority - ruling that his trial was unfair because it introduced witnesses separate from the central charges - prevailed by a single vote, 4-3. The dissenting judges described that decision as \"oblivious,\" \"naive\" and \"endangering decades of progress.\"\n\nThey have joined a roiling debate about what the standard of evidence in sex crimes trials should be. But criminal convictions have never seemed like the ultimate measure of Weinstein's behavior. Whether he remains a felon or not, he can never be tried for the most overarching offense he is accused of. That is because, at its core, the Weinstein story - along with its greatest impact - is all about work.\n\n\"A lot of these stories are about what's been lost career-wise, and there's no criminal remedy that is going to get at that,\" said Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern University.\n\nBack when Weinstein was at the height of his power, he had many gifts as a producer. But where he stood above others was in his ability to make careers. He hired and moulded Matt Damon, Michelle Williams, Jennifer Lawrence, Quentin Tarantino and some of the most successful producers working today. He invented the Oscar campaign as we know it. At those awards, he was thanked more often than God.\n\nBehind the scenes, he was summoning that career-shaping power in the darkest way, according to his accusers. The nearly 100 allegations about Weinstein range in severity from harassment to rape. But almost all those stories follow the same plot: Whether they were actors or assistants, the women were mostly young. Some were in their first month, or even day, on the job. Laura Madden was a novice assistant on Irish movie sets. Rowena Chiu had directed plays at Oxford University. They and many others wanted to work, to contribute, to secure a piece of the action in a mostly male-run business.\n\nWeinstein is accused of luring them and many others with a standard script that promised a career payoff.\n\n\"Come to my hotel room to talk about how we can throw you an Oscar campaign\", Judith Godr\u00e8che said he told her.\n\n\"Join me to review this newly shot footage\", Sophie Dix recalled him saying.\n\nWhen Dawn Dunning arrived in his hotel room for what was billed as a work meeting, she said, he offered her contracts for his next three films on the condition that she have a threesome with him. (Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.)\n\n\"Welcome to the Miramax family,\" Katherine Kendall said he told her in 1993. Soon he was nude and she was fleeing, she said.\n\n\"He said the things that make you think that's going to happen for you,\" Kendall recalled in a recent interview. \"He didn't hint. He came right out and said it. He's Harvey Weinstein, and he's directly handing you the key, or so you think.\"\n\nOver the years, he appears to have honed the pressure even further, deploying one woman's name to push the next.\n\nAlthough Gwyneth Paltrow spurned his advances, some women say he goaded them by claiming that she and other stars had said yes, that they had only won their roles and Oscars by sleeping with him. By their description, it was a system of turning women's aspirations and achievements against them. Work was also the reason many stayed silent for years: They feared that speaking out would mean ruin.\n\nYears later, many Weinstein accusers have told of the pain they experienced over physical violations. But they have also aired grief over career losses. Many of the women are middle-aged now. They point out that there are no do-overs in their work lives. That without Weinstein, they might have achieved more. That they can never get those years and possibilities back.\n\nCaitlin Dulany, a 60-year-old actor, said that her memories of her encounter with Weinstein - he offered career help and shocked her by taking his clothes off, she has said - are \"100% mixed up in the loss that I feel career-wise.\"\n\nThis is the part of the Weinstein story that no criminal court is likely to come close to addressing. Sexual harassment is illegal, but it's not a criminal offense, and the laws and system that combat it are generally weak.\n\nThe criminal justice system isn't built to remedy the destruction of someone's career options or ambitions. Women have pursued civil suits against the producer, but many were bundled into one big case that left them waiting in line with other parties owed money by The Weinstein Co. Compared with the payouts for, say, Jeffrey Epstein's victims, the remuneration has been spotty.\n\nBut while the centrality of work to the Weinstein story has made accountability difficult, it has also endowed the saga with some of its special moral force and helped cohere a powerful new consensus on workplace standards.\n\nNot long ago, a little sexual harassment here and there in the workplace in the United States - or sometimes a lot - was often tolerated. Now, it's far less common to see that behaviour rationalised or accepted.\n\nDuring the initial Weinstein investigation, some dismissive Hollywood executives pooh-poohed his behaviour, referring to it as \"chasing women around a desk.\" Now, some of those same executives are making films and television shows with \"intimacy coordinators\" on set to prevent misbehaviour.\n\nHarassment investigations have become a mini-genre of journalism. Before the Weinstein allegations emerged in 2017, firings for workplace misconduct were exceptional; now, they happen all the time.\n\nIn the past seven years, laws about sexual misconduct - strengthening worker protections, limiting secret settlements and making it easier to bring claims - have been passed in nearly half the states in the US.\n\n\"The norms have changed,\" Tuerkheimer said. \"It's not that there aren't transgressions, but the baseline has been reset.\"\n\nWhatever happens in criminal court, this is the true legacy of Weinstein, or better yet, the women who came forward about him: No one should ever show up at a job to face unwelcome sexual pressure from the boss. -- \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType":

The show premiered in 1999, and since then Hargitay has been advocating for sexual assault victims -- the most recent example of this is her scathing remarks on Harvey Weinstein.\n\nOn Thursday, Hargitay attended Variety's Power of Women event. She was honored for her advocacy work, and while she spoke, she touched on the recent news of Weinstein's conviction being overturned.\n\n'LAW & ORDER: SVU' STAR MARISKA HARGITAY WAS RAPED BY A FRIEND IN HER 30S: 'TRAUMA FRACTURES OUR MIND'\n\n\"I want to talk today about reversing convictions,\" she began, per Variety. \"It's impossible to reverse my conviction that survivors matter, that what happened to us matters, and that our society must respond to survivors more compassionately, more holistically, with a deeper, more nuanced understanding of what healing means.\"\n\nLater in her speech, she said, \"I do want to say something about the overturned Harvey Weinstein conviction. Specifically about the reason it was overturned: Too many women's voices. Too many women were allowed to speak.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Risky to let women speak? You're damn right it is. Too many women speaking brings change.\"\n\nIn April, the New York appeals court found that Weinstein's trial judge allowed prosecutors to call women who said Weinstein had assaulted them to testify, even though their accusations did not specifically relate to the entertainment mogul's charges.\n\nWeinstein, who was a very successful film producer before the allegations began, was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted in February 2020 of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and third-degree rape of hairstylist Jessica Mann in 2013.\n\nHe was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault after actor Annabella Sciorra's allegations of rape in the 1990s. He has denied ever engaging in non-consensual sex.\n\nEven though the New York appeals court overturned Weinstein's conviction, that does not mean he is getting out of prison.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nAfter Weinstein's sentencing in New York in 2020, he was extradited to California in July 2021 to face sexual assault allegations made by four women in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills between 2004 and 2013.\n\nIn December 2022, he was found guilty of rape, forced oral copulation and another sexual misconduct count involving a woman known as Jane Doe 1. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in February 2023. Weinstein's legal team has vowed to appeal that conviction as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nWeinstein also faces charges in London for two alleged offenses in 1996.\n\nMeanwhile, Hargitay has been pushing for the rights of sexual assault survivors for years, founding the Joyful Heart Foundation in 2004. According to the organization's website, their mission is to \"transform society's response to sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse, support survivors' healing, and end this violence forever.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital's Lauryn Overhultz contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

Israel is willing to enter a ceasefire only. Negotiators on Thursday left the latest meetings in Cairo without a deal, and Israel said it would proceed with its planned Rafah operation.\n\nThe chief Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Admiral

Israel has said victory in the seven-month-old conflict is impossible without taking Rafah.\n\nThe Netanyahu government had kept silent over reports that Washington was holding back a shipment of aerial bombs - until, on Wednesday, Biden went public with the measure, saying it was part of a U.S. warning to the Israelis not to \"go into Rafah\".\n\n\"If we must stand alone, we shall stand alone,\" Netanyahu said without referring specifically to the U.S. announcement.\n\n\"If we must, we shall fight with our fingernails,\" he said in a video statement. \"But we have much more than our fingernails, and with that strength of spirit, with God's help, together we shall be victorious.\"\n\nThe conservative prime minister's comments were echoed by the other two voting members of his war cabinet, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and centrist former defence minister Benny Gantz - although none said explicitly that a deeper sweep of Rafah would be ordered.\n\n\"I turn to Israel's enemies as well as to our best of friends and say - the State of Israel cannot be subdued,\" Gallant said in a speech. \"We will stand strong, we will achieve our goals - we will hit Hamas, we will hit (Lebanon's) Hezbollah, and we will achieve security.\"\n\nGantz voiced appreciation for what the Israeli military has described as unprecedented U.S. support and supplies in the war.\n\n\"Israel has a duty, in terms of national security and morality, to keep fighting in order to return our hostages and end the Hamas threat against southern Israel,\" he said on X.\n\n\"And the United States has a moral and strategic duty to extend to Israel the tools that are necessary for this mission.\"\n\nIn parallel to the public dispute, the United States has been trying to shepherd along Egyptian- and Qatari-mediated talks between Israel and Hamas that would free some hostages.\n\nThose have stumbled on Hamas's demand for an end to the Gaza war. Israel is willing to enter a ceasefire only. Negotiators on Thursday left the latest meetings in Cairo without a deal, and Israel said it would proceed with its planned Rafah operation.\n\nThe chief Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said in a briefing that the armed forces had sufficient munitions for Rafah \"and other operations that are planned\".

On Wednesday, he said the United States would not provide offensive weapons for a Rafah offensive, raising pressure on Netanyahu.\n\nBut in a statement released Thursday, Netanyahu said \"if we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails.\"\n\nIsrael's top military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, also appeared to downplay the practical impact of any arms holdup. \"The army has munitions for the missions it plans, and for the missions in Rafah, too -- we have what we need,\" he said in response to a question at a news conference.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly threatened to invade Rafah, where some 1.3 million Palestinians -- over half the population -- have sought refuge. The city in southern Gaza is also the main hub for humanitarian operations, which have been severely hindered by the closure of Gaza's two main crossings this week.\n\nUS says Rafah offensive would jeopardize cease-fire talks as Biden threatens to halt more Israel aid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States warned on Thursday that Israel will be dealing a strategic victory to Hamas if it carries out plans for an all-out assault on Rafah, the militants' last major stronghold in Gaza.\n\nThe warning was backed by a new threat from President Joe Biden: He says he will pause more offensive military assistance to Israel if it goes through with the operation in a city where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering.\n\nBiden last week put on hold a shipment of large bombs to Israel over concerns the weapons are of the type that has caused significant civilian casualties in Gaza and would almost certainly do more such damage if Israel conducted a major offensive in Rafah.\n\nOn Wednesday, he held out the possibility of holding up future shipments of bomb guidance kits and artillery to Israel, in hopes the threat would turn Israel back from an operation in the city.\n\nThe pronouncements are part of last-ditch push for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government to rethink their public commitments to invade the city in an effort to eradicate Hamas. The U.S. believes such a move would result in significant civilian casualties and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nTrump's hush money trial hinges on business transactions, not on Stormy Daniels' shocking testimony\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense attorney on Thursday accused Stormy Daniels of slowly altering the details of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, trying to persuade jurors that a key prosecution witness in the former president's hush money trial cannot be believed.\n\n\"The details of your story keep changing, right?\" attorney Susan Necheles asked at one point.\n\n\"No,\" Daniels said.\n\nAs the jury looked on, the two women traded barbs over what Necheles said were inconsistencies in Daniels' description of the encounter with Trump in a hotel room. He denies the whole story.\n\n\"You made all this up, right?\" Necheles asked.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson survived a motion to vacate. Here's why his job is far from safe\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Johnson's job isn't safe yet.\n\nIn a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nGuns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of guns stolen from cars in the U.S. has tripled over the last decade, making them the largest source of stolen guns in the country, an analysis of FBI data by the gun safety group Everytown found.\n\nThe rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases in the U.S., according to the report, which analyzes FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states and was provided to The Associated Press.\n\nThe stolen weapons have, in some cases, turned up at crime scenes. In July 2021, a gun taken from an unlocked car in Riverside, Florida, was used to kill a 27-year-old Coast Guard member as she tried to stop a car burglary in her neighborhood.\n\nThe alarming trend underscores the need for Americans to safely secure their firearms to prevent them from getting into the hands of dangerous people, said Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Director Steve Dettelbach, whose agency has separately found links between stolen guns and violent crimes.\n\n\"People don't go to a mall and steal a firearm from a locked car to go hunting. Those guns are going straight to the street,\" said Dettelbach, whose agency was not involved in the report. \"They're going to violent people who can't pass a background check. They're going to gangs. They're going to drug dealers, and they're going to hurt and kill the people who live in the next town, the next county or the next state.\"\n\nVideo shows Florida deputy announced himself prior to fatal shooting of Black airman\n\nFORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, according to body camera video shown to reporters Thursday.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden rejected assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on May 3 and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nThe video shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" and fired off shots. He then shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\nHarvey Weinstein won't be sent back to California while he awaits New York rape retrial\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while awaiting retrial or be sent to California to serve his prison sentence for rape there.\n\nThe fallen movie mogul, who showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit, did not consent to California's extradition request during a brief court hearing Thursday. The 72-year-old will remain behind bars at the Rikers Island jail, where he was returned to from a city hospital just days ago.\n\nCalifornia now needs to produce a warrant signed by the governor within 90 days, Judge Joanne Watters said.\n\n\"They are not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do,\" Diana Fabi Samson, Weinstein's lawyer, said outside court following the appearance.\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, which prosecuted Weinstein, referred extradition questions to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTrump-affiliated group releases new national security book outlining possible second-term approach\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Making future military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country participating in peace talks with Russia. Banning Chinese nationals from buying property within a 50-mile radius of U.S. government buildings. Filling the national security sector with acolytes of Donald Trump.\n\nOne of several groups trying to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration if the former Republican president wins in November is out with a new policy book that aims to articulate an \"America First\" national security agenda.\n\nThe book, shared with The Associated Press before its release Thursday, is the latest effort from the America First Policy Institute. Like the Heritage Foundation's \"Project 2025,\" the group is seeking to help Trump avoid the mistakes of 2016, when he entered the White House largely unprepared.\n\nBeyond its policy efforts, the institute's transition project has been working to draft dozens of executive orders and developing a training program for future political appointees. Heritage has been building an extensive personnel database and offering its own policy manuals.\n\nBoth groups stress they are independent from Trump's campaign, which has repeatedly tried to distance itself from such efforts, insisting that the only Trump-backed policies are those the candidate articulates himself.\n\nTechnology crushing human creativity? Apple's new iPad ad has struck a nerve online\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years -- from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n\"The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\" a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf -- with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution didn't land.\n\n\"I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\" said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \"I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\"\n\nIn new memoir, Tom Selleck looks back at the hard years that made him a star in 'Magnum, P.I.'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Selleck starts his memoir in the middle of a car crash. He is 17 and in the passenger seat when he and two friends go airborne in his mom's red Chevy Corvair, tumbling off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. Everyone would be eventually fine, but it's a harrowing moment and a unique way to kick off a look back.\n\n\"That's an unusual way to start,\" the \"Magnum, P.I.\" and \"Blue Bloods\" star admits in an interview. \"It seemed like the perfect way to go back a little bit and talk about my upbringing through the bad accident and the ramifications.\"\n\n\"You Never Know\" takes readers through Selleck's years at the University of Southern California, in the Army, being bachelor No. 2 on \"The Dating Game\" and small roles and commercials before earning an Emmy and lasting fame as Thomas Magnum.\n\n\"I didn't have one of those headline-grabbing lives,\" the 79-year-old actor tells The Associated Press. \"The only way I could make the book entertaining -- and I think my primary job and goal in this book is to entertain -- was to get into these stories in a way that the reader got inside my head.\"\n\nSelleck spent four years writing the book longhand on yellow legal pads, quoting from George Will and Raymond Chandler along the way. He would write in the afternoon and read what he'd written to his wife at dinner.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biden spoke with CNN's Erin Burnett Wednesday to denounce Israel's plans to stage a large-scale assault on the Palestinian city in the southern Gaza Strip.\n\nAt a press conference, Graham looked into the camera and addressed Biden directly, saying, \"Mr. President if you do not change this policy, you will have destroyed the last best chance to deliver lasting stability in the Mideast for generations.\" Graham continued:\n\nSaudi Arabia is watching. Would you as a nation sign a defense agreement with the United States knowing what we have just done to Israel? Is signing on the dotted line with the United States on a mutual defense agreement equivalent with outsourcing your national security to the United States? That is the message you're sending. Israel is being asked to turn the war fighting over to the United States. \"Let us plan how to do this, not you.\" That is a huge mistake.\n\nNumber one, I trust Israel more than I trust [Defense Secretary Lloyd] Austin. He still said Afghanistan withdrawal was a good idea. Bottom line, there's a lot at stake here. I think the region and the world is going to second-guess future relationships with us, Mr. President, if you don't change your mind.\n\nIn his CNN interview, Biden said, \"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently. But it's, it's just wrong. We're not going to - we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells\" for a Rafa invasion.\n\nNetanyahu said in a statement, \"If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone.

(WSVN) \u2014 A retired police officer and his family pulled off a sinking save when they came to a couple\u2019s rescue while vacationing on the west coast of Florida. The good Samaritans sprang into action after a storm hit Siesta Key, June 11. Ohio residents Dean and Shana Ramsey were in their car when they got swept into a body of water. \u201cThe water sucked me right down into \u2013 us into that lagoon,\u201d said Dean. But Kentucky resident Mike Bell and family were in the right place at the right time. \u201cI ran over to the edge of the water and kind of stopped for a second. I realized it wasn\u2019t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,\u201d said Bell. \u201cAt about that time, [my wife] Ginger exited the front of the door, which is very close to the pond, and I looked at her and I said, \u2018We need flotation devices.'\u201d Everyone was able to get out OK. The Ramseys were surprised to learn they share an Ohio connection with their rescuer. Bell is a retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant. The families said they plan to reunite in the near future. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

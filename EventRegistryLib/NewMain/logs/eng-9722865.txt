who was engulfed in a number of high-profile scandals.\n\nWeiner was caught on multiple occasions sending explicit snaps to various women - even during his political campaigns.\n\nBut he failed to learn from his missteps and was later sentenced to 21 months in prison after he began sexting a 15-year-old girl.\n\nAbedin, who had initially stood by him, eventually decided to pull the plug and the pair went their separate ways.\n\nThe former couple share a son, Jordan, who was born in 2011.\n\nAbedin was previously rumored to be dating Bradley Cooper for a short spell in 2022 -

Soros, 38, went with a gray tuxedo and added a gold bug pin to his bowtie to match.\n\nHe cheekily captioned an Instagram Stories shot from the gala, \"A little buggy out\" -- referring to their matching insect accoutrements for the glam event where the theme was \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\nHillary Clinton's former deputy chief of staff has also been seen leaving her now-fianc\u00e9's apartment downtown in NYC.\n\nOne former senior Clinton aide had previously told Page Six of the pair, \"It's a classic Clinton world couple. Alex is the perfect match for Huma.\"\n\nAbedin has long been considered a \"second daughter\" to Hillary, and Alex's dad, George Soros -- who made his money in hedge funds and is worth $6.7 billion, according to Forbes -- was one of the top 10 donors to Hillary's presidential run in 2016, contributing more than $9.5 million into the campaign.\n\n\"I'm thrilled for her,\" an Abedin friend previously told Page Six of her relationship with Soros. \"She works so hard and she deserves happiness. I just hope she's happy -- she's been through so much.\"\n\nWe hear that the engaged couple -- who met through a mutual friend who was dating one of Alex's cousins -- have been recently traveling together, and sources told us that Abedin was appearing in the Balkans for a talk.\n\nThey'd previously gone to Munich, Germany, at the same time as the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering on international security policy that attracts world leaders.\n\nThey've mostly kept a low profile, but were also spotted in April sitting courtside at a Knicks playoffs game.\n\nIt's certainly a happy ending for Abedin, who has a son with her ex, disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner. They were married from 2010 to 2017.\n\nIt will be Soros' first marriage.\n\nA source previously told Page Six of the scion: \"Alex started to get more politically active 10 years ago when he was still finishing college.

You Can't Make This Stuff Up!", "body": "OPINION| In a move that has left many Trump supporters scratching their heads and reaching for the Pepto Bismol, Huma Abedin and Alex Soros have announced their engagement. Yes, you read that correctly, the woman who once served as Hillary Clinton's right-hand gal has decided to tie the knot with the son of none other than George Soros.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. This is like the political equivalent of a horror movie crossover. You've got Huma Abedin, who has been embroiled in more scandals than a soap opera villain, and Alex Soros, the heir to a fortune built on manipulating global markets and funding left-wing causes. It's like the ultimate power couple for the \"New World Order\" crowd.\n\nBut let's take a step back and examine this unholy union. Huma Abedin, who has been accused of mishandling classified information and being a part of the Clinton machine, is now set to marry into the Soros dynasty. It's like the political equivalent of a reality TV show, where the contestants are all vying for the title of \"Most Corrupt Couple.\"\n\nAnd let's not forget about Alex Soros, the man who has inherited his father's billions and is now using that wealth to push his progressive agenda. He's like a real-life supervillain, but instead of trying to take over the world with a giant laser, he's trying to destroy our country with his woke ideology.\n\nTrump supporters, this is a match made in political purgatory. It's a union that represents everything we stand against: corruption, manipulation, and a blatant disregard for the values that make this country great.\n\nBut here's the thing, folks. We can't let this engagement get us down. We need to stay focused on the real issues facing our nation, like the economy, national security, and the ongoing battle against the woke mob.\n\nSo let Huma Abedin and Alex Soros have their moment in the spotlight. We'll be over here, working to Make America Great Again and ensuring that their twisted vision for our country never becomes a reality.\n\nIn the end, this engagement is just another example of the swamp creatures trying to consolidate their power. But we're not going to let them win. We're going to keep fighting for the values that made this country great, and we're going to do it with a sense of humor and a healthy dose of skepticism.", "source": {"uri": "thebeltwayreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Beltway Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_crane@thebeltwayreport.com", "name": "Jack Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huma Abedin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Soros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soap opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New World Order (conspiracy theory)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purgatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://thebeltwayreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Alex-Soros-is-engaged-his-new-bride-is.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722865", "eventUri": "eng-9722865", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The Daily Beast reported in March that \"'a Trumpworld source' said Herrera would be 'a disaster for Republicans' if elected.\" A Sunday, May 26 Daily Beast article reports the \"gunfluencer\" \u2014 who has over 3 million subscribers \u2014 recently \"posted to YouTube a video in which he wears a balaclava, fires an Armalite rifle, uses Irish stereotypes while joking about the IRA [Irish Republican Army], and says he 'f\u2013king hate[s] the British.'\" The Beast reports: The Armalite assault rifle was an American gun that became synonymous with the Provisional Irish Republican Army or IRA, the dominant republican terror group during the Troubles, the period of violent unrest in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain from 1968 to 1998. The accepted death toll from the Troubles, established in the book Lost Lives by authors David McKittrick, Seamus Kelters, Brian Feeney, Chris Thornton and David McVea, is 3,720. The Provisional IRA killed more than 1,700 people\u2013hundreds of them civilians. According to Ulster University, a college in Northern Ireland, more than 47,000 people were injured in shootings, bombings and other acts of violence.

He gleefully promotes violence and extremism.\" The Beast also notes: Also known as the AK Guy, Herrera has more than 3.4 million followers on YouTube. His videos have courted trouble before. Earlier this year, in response to a video in which Herrera fires a German World War II submachine gun (which he calls 'the original ghetto blaster') and goose-steps while an associate wears a German uniform, Gonzales branded his opponent a 'known neo-Nazi.' Herrera denied the charge, saying: 'This is the death spiral ladies and gentlemen. He has to cry to his liberal friends about me, because Republicans won\u2019t listen anymore.' Gonzales's district \u2014 which Herrera is vying for \u2014 includes Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in 2022. While the YouTuber has secured support from hardliner GOP lawmakers like US Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Herrera may have hurt his chance of securing a primary win in March when he posted a video making fun of Donald Trump's son, Barron.

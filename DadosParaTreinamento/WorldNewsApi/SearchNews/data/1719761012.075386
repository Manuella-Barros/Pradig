With a silky, cloud-like texture, it glides on smoothly, enhancing skin without adding weight or greasiness. \"Oil-free, its suitable for sensitive and blemish-prone skin and contains SPF 15 protection to shield your complexion from the suns damaging rays. If you're looking for bridal make up, this is the perfect primer for your big day (or any big day you've got coming up, for that matter...).\" Shop it here. One shopper wrote: \"I like this for summertime. Where I live it's very hot and humid and wearing SPF and makeup is a very difficult and uncomfortable thing during those months. I've found if I put this on top of my tinted mineral SPF and then set with loose powder my makeup stays quite well throughout the day.\" \"i have combination skin and this primer does not clog my pores or intensifies my oiliness. What it does and I can't be without it is that it provides a smooth base for my make up and it helps it LAST even in extreme humidity or heat. For my needs it is worth the extra penny,\" gushed another. A third wrote: \"I love this so much also on its own it gives me a smooth and blurry effect and also reduces redness.\" If oiliness isn't your issue, you may want to try a primer with more hydrating ingredients, as dry skin can lead to your makeup not staying put throughout the day too. The Armani Luminous Silk Hydrating Primer helps to add a natural-looking luminosity to the skin and promotes seamless and even makeup application. Shop it here.

Adam Hadwin, who stayed at 6-under par with an even performance in the second round, watched as Scheffler used three birdies on the front nine to take the top spot. However, two bogeys brought Scheffler and Hadwin back together, keeping them tied at 6-under as the second round neared its end. On a challenging day at Muirfield Village, where the course played over a stroke above par and five players failed to break 80, the world No. 1 fired a 4-under 68 to take control of the Memorial Tournament heading into the weekend. Scheffler stands at 9-under, three strokes clear of defending champion Viktor Hovland and first-round leader Hadwin. A win Sunday would not only mark his fifth overall this season but also his third signature event win, adding to his victories at the Players Championship and the Masters. Scheffler is aiming to join an elite group of players who have achieved five victories in a season, including Justin Thomas (2017), Jason Day (2015), and Jordan Spieth (2015). Scheffler could threaten the all-time PGA Tour record of nine wins in a season held by Tiger Woods (2000) and Vijay Singh (2004). PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele remains in the mix at 3-under, demonstrating resilience with impressive back-nine play to convert challenging shots into scoring opportunities. Rory McIlroy and Tony Finau will need significant performances to challenge Scheffler\u2019s lead. The leader, Scottie Scheffler, has shown exceptional skill across all facets of the game, combining the best driving, iron play and short game in the world. His Friday round was notable, particularly on the par-4 10th, where he recovered from a difficult position to save par with a 15-foot putt, remaining bogey-free at that point. Scheffler is poised to convert his 36-hole lead into another substantial winner\u2019s check, but with strong competitors close behind, the second half of the tournament promises to be thrilling.

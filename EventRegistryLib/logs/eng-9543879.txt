The judges cited the \"explosion of student disruptions\" and the \"virulent spread of antisemitism\" at Columbia, which has now canceled its main graduation ceremony because of the unrest.\n\nLed by Fifth Circuit appellate judges James Ho and Elizabeth Branch, who spearheaded a clerkship boycott of Yale Law School in 2022 and Stanford Law School in 2023, as well as by Matthew Solomson on the U.S Court of Federal Claims, the judges wrote in a letter to Columbia president Minouche Shafik that they would no longer hire \"anyone who joins the Columbia University community -- whether as undergraduates or as law students -- beginning with the entering class of 2024.\"\n\n\"Freedom of speech protects protest, not trespass, and certainly not acts or threats of violence or terrorism,\" the judges wrote. \"It has become clear that Columbia engages in grotesque double standards when it comes to protecting free speech and policing student misconduct.\"\n\nThe letter's signatories include Alan Albright, a district judge who hears a fourth of the nation's patent cases; Stephen Vaden, a former general counsel at the Department of Agriculture who now sits on the United States Court of International Trade; and Matthew Kacsmaryk, the district judge who suspended approval of the abortion drug mifepristone in a controversial ruling last year. Others are well-known district judges appointed by former president Donald Trump.\n\nWhile 12 judges joined the Yale boycott anonymously, Monday's letter marks the first time that more than two judges have said on the record that they will not hire graduates from an elite university.\n\nIt also marks an about-face for Solomson -- one of the letter's lead signatories -- who previously criticized the boycotts of Yale and Stanford as a form of collective punishment. His decision to spearhead the Columbia boycott underscores just how much good will the school has lost over the encampment, which effectively put the campus on lockdown.\n\nThe letter, which comes one week after students occupied Columbia's main administrative building, Hamilton Hall, with support from faculty, argues that the rot has spread too deep for judges to hire from Columbia \"absent extraordinary change.\" It is likely to fuel debate about the value of an Ivy League degree, which, per a much-discussed prediction by statistics guru Nate Silver, \"is going to go down a lot.\"\n\n\"Recent events demonstrate that ideological homogeneity throughout the entire institution of Columbia has destroyed its ability to train future leaders of a pluralistic and intellectually diverse country,\" the judges write. \"If Columbia had been faced with a campus uprising of religious conservatives upset because they view abortion as a tragic genocide, we have no doubt that the university's response would have been profoundly different.\"\n\nThe letter marks a new front in the hellish public relations war that has consumed Columbia and cost it major donor capital. As the encampment drew throngs of outsiders to the university's doorstep -- some of whom promised daily repeats of the Oct. 7 attacks -- pressure mounted on Shafik, the university's president, to lay down the law.\n\nShe did not do so until April 30, after nearly 5,000 alumni signed a petition demanding that the police clear Hamilton Hall. In the interim, Columbia lost one of its most prominent patrons, Robert Kraft, who said he could not in good conscience donate to a school awash in \"virulent hate.\" Billionaires Leon Cooperman and Henry Swieca have also cut ties with the university.\n\nThe clerkship boycott represents one of the most extreme forms of outside pressure yet. It targets a key source of the university's prestige and could deter right-leaning high school seniors with an interest in law from applying to Columbia for college, at a time when some families are revisiting enrollment decisions amid the unrest.\n\nUnlike the boycotts of Yale and Stanford, which apply only to the universities' law schools, the moratorium on Columbia clerks extends to undergraduates as well.\n\n\"As judges who hire the best and brightest graduates every year to serve as law clerks in the federal judiciary, we have lost confidence in Columbia as an institution of higher education,\" the letter reads. \"Columbia has instead become an incubator of bigotry.\"\n\nColumbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHo and Branch, the two Fifth Circuit judges, announced in 2022 that they would no longer hire clerks from Yale Law School, citing a string of incidents in which speakers were shouted down and students were threatened with discipline for exercising their free speech. They extended the boycott to Stanford after a mob of students shouted down their colleague, Kyle Duncan, with help from the law school's diversity dean.\n\nBoth boycotts focused on administrators who Ho and Branch said had encouraged student radicalism and cultivated an ideological monoculture. At Columbia, by contrast, the protests' biggest boosters have come not from the administration but from the faculty.\n\nJoseph Howley, a classics professor who chairs a required first-year humanities course for all undergraduates, gave interviews from inside the encampment and said there was \"no evidence\" of anti-Semitism on Columbia's campus. Numerous faculty groups have condemned Shafik's decision to call the police -- both at the start of the encampment to arrest protesters and last week to clear Hamilton Hall -- with the university's chapter of American Association of University Professors calling for a vote of no confidence. In the history department alone, well over half the faculty signed a statement condemning the \"criminalization\" of the protest, which violated numerous laws and school rules.\n\n\"Both professors and administrators are on the front lines of the campus disruptions, encouraging the virulent spread of antisemitism and bigotry,\" the judges write. \"Significant and dramatic change in the composition of its faculty and administration is required to restore confidence in Columbia.\"\n\nThe boycott could spur that change by exploiting the logic of supply and demand. Clerkships are a coveted commodity among law students, and part of the selling point of elite law schools is that they help their students land one. Since there are far more conservative judges than there conservative law students, law schools rely disproportionately on conservatives to boost their clerkship placements and prestige -- a dynamic that confers significant leverage on the right side of the federal bench.\n\nWhile it's hard to measure the success of past boycotts, Yale Law School made a number of reforms in the years following Ho and Branch's pressure campaign. It hired two conservative law professors -- previously the school employed zero -- and announced that one of them, Keith Whittington, would launch a new center devoted to the study of academic freedom. Stanford also made noise about its commitment to open debate, parting ways with the diversity dean, Tirien Steinbach, who had disrupted Duncan and requiring a cursory session on free speech for all law students.\n\nAt Columbia, the judges are demanding \"serious consequences\" for the students and professors who participated in the encampment. Though the school has promised to expel the occupiers of Hamilton Hall and suspend others for trespassing, it has been vague about the terms of those suspensions, which followed weeks of amnesty and extended deadlines as the university tried to negotiate with protest leaders.\n\nSome suspended students were also spotted at the encampment after they'd ostensibly been kicked off campus -- including Khymani James, the protest leader who declared that \"Zionists don't deserve to live.\" Another student, Aidan Parisi, who was suspended for hosting an unauthorized event with members of Palestinian terror groups, remained on campus for weeks after being told to leave.\n\nThe judges suggest that the school's disciplinary actions so far have been inadequate. \"In recent years, citizens have been told that unlawfully trespassing on and occupying public spaces is a sufficient basis to warrant incarceration,\" the letter reads. \"So that same conduct should surely be sufficient to warrant lesser measures such as expulsion.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_sibarium@freebeacon.com", "name": "Aaron Sibarium", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yale Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Vaden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Vaden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_J._Kacsmaryk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew J.

In a fitting tribute, a group of federal judges have announced they will no longer hire law clerks who choose to attend Columbia University (not just the law school) starting with the Fall of 2024. The leaders of the letter, as you might expect, are Judge James Ho of the Fifth Circuit and Judge Lisa Branch of the Eleventh Circuit, along with Judge Matthew Solomson of the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nThe letter begins:\n\nSince the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas, Columbia University has become ground zero for the explosion of student disruptions, anti-semitism, and hatred for diverse viewpoints on campuses across the Nation. Disruptors have threatened violence, committed assaults, and destroyed property. As judges who hire law clerks every year to serve in the federal judiciary, we have lost confidence in Columbia as an institution of higher education. Columbia has instead become an incubator of bigotry. As a result, Columbia has disqualified itself from educating the future leaders of our country.\n\nAnd concludes:\n\nConsidering recent events, and absent extraordinary change, we will not hire anyone who joins the Columbia University community -- whether as undergraduates or law students -- beginning with the entering class of 2024.\n\nJustice William Brennan refused to hire law clerks from Harvard Law School because he disliked criticisms of the Supreme Court by some of its faculty. The objective of our boycott is different -- it is not to hamper academic freedom, but to restore it at Columbia University.\n\nPeople may not be familiar with Justice Brennan's practice. Owen Fiss discusses it in his book, Pillars of Justice:\n\nThe letter is also signed by Judges Alan Albright, David Counts, James W. Hendrix, Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, Jeremy D. Kernodle. Tilman E. Self, III, Brantley Starr, Drew B. Tipton, Daniel M. Traynor, and Stephen Alexander Vaden.\n\nI recognize that many (most?) judges do not agree with the Ho/Branch boycott model. Indeed, as far as I know, Judge Duncan did not join the boycott against Stanford! Other than Judge Solomson, I do not see any Jewish judges who have joined this letter. There is still time. And I don't think this program needs to be limited to federal judges.

Columbia on Monday canceled its main graduation ceremony due to the ongoing protests. Federal judges hire law grads annually for year-long clerkships that can lead to prestigious and high-paying legal jobs. The boycott will apply to students who enter Columbia this fall, the judges wrote.\n\nThe letter called for \"serious consequences\" for students and faculty who participated in campus disruptions and for the enforcement of free speech rules. Protests against the war in Gaza have spread to dozens of U.S. universities. Demonstrators maintained an encampment on Columbia's main campus for weeks before some temporarily occupied a campus building last week. New York City police cleared out the building and arrested more than 100 people.\n\nThe judges who signed Monday's letter were all appointed by Trump, who has praised the New York Police Department's response to the protesters, calling them \"raging lunatics and Hamas sympathizers.\" Two-thirds of the signatories are based in Texas, including Matthew Kacsmaryk, who gained national attention last year by suspending approval of the abortion pill mifepristone in a case now before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTwo of the lead signers, U.S. Circuit Judges James Ho of the 5th Circuit and Elizabeth Branch of the 11th Circuit, had previously announced boycotts of clerks from Yale and Stanford, citing disruptions of conservative speakers on campus.

An Article I judge?\n\nBut they headlined the last superficial campus stunt when they bemoaned Yale law students for protesting a hate group, so now they're stars!\n\nThere are over 100 campuses with ongoing protests right now. Ask yourself, why are these judges specifically writing Columbia? In part, because they realize shutting off hiring from every school with students protesting the mounting humanitarian crisis would leave their clerking cupboard almost completely bare, but more because \"Columbia\" will get their performative stunt noticed in ways that boycotting the University of New Mexico will not.\n\nCampus protests against the ongoing Gaza war raise important issues for a lot of stakeholders. Exactly zero of those people are federal judges. Indeed, to the extent the protests and related police action against them could land in court, a responsible and ethically conscious jurist would be mindful to remain detached from the policy squabbles that could land before them.

Attempting to use their offices to influence policy is so much more disgusting.\n\nAnyway, the judges have a list of demands because -- apparently -- holding a university hostage with a list of demands is acceptable for powerful people to casually play with the careers of young people but not for a bunch of students with no hope of access to such a platform. Again, the sliver of this that's not just a public relations ploy for judges looking to boost their Q score with the QAnon set is about rewriting free speech as a top-down right to be imposed by the powerful upon the weak.\n\n1. Serious consequences for students and faculty who have participated in campus disruptions and violated established rules concerning the use of university facilities and public spaces and threats against fellow members of the university community.... Universities should also identify students who engage in such conduct so that future employers can avoid hiring them. If not, employers are forced to assume the risk that anyone they hire from Columbia may be one of these disruptive and hateful students.\n\nDoxxing over free expression is entirely in line with the conservative legal movement's recent program. On the other hand, this is a welcome effort on the part of these judges to provide at least some kind of explanation for collectively punishing the whole school. It's not that they're too dumb to make a distinction between a Columbia student involved in the protest and one who wasn't, it's that they just can't tell who to trust unless the school marks the students with a Scarlet P. After all, what if some hardcore Trotskyist protestor is hoping to someday clerk for Matthew freakin' Kacsmaryk?\n\nObviously this whole letter is in the utmost bad faith, but their proposal would blackball a student protestor with Black Power leanings who organized a walkout and participated in violent riots on an Ivy League campus... like Clarence Thomas.\n\nThe judges also ask for \"neutrality and nondiscrimination.\"\n\nIt has become clear that Columbia applies double standards when it comes to free speech and student misconduct. If Columbia had been faced with a campus uprising of religious conservatives upset because they view abortion as a tragic genocide, we have no doubt that the university's response would have been profoundly different.\n\nYeah, Columbia wouldn't have done anything.\n\nWhite nationalists marched on UVA literally chanting \"Jews will not replace us\" and the school kept its distance. And these judges stood by and shrugged. Now that some Columbia kids are saying \"maybe don't bomb Rafah\" suddenly these jurists have found \"antisemitism\" on their Word-of-the-Day calendars. That the judges' intended audience for this very letter responded to the UVA march by calling them \"very fine people\" might give you a sense of why they didn't rush to their typewriters back then. Every time you see these judges on some hyped-up faux outrage, be sure that the intent is to get their names printed out by that woman who sits behind Trump and hands him fawning news articles all day.\n\n3. Viewpoint diversity on the faculty and across the administration -- including the admissions office.\n\nThere it is!\n\nUp until here, the judges could try to drape their remarks as some sort of vague legal advice. But we're past implementing proper balancing of free speech and onto affirmative action -- except the \"good\" kind that advances the discrete and insular minority who think voting rights are overrated. \"Viewpoint diversity\" hijacks the language of civil rights to advance bad scholars. It turns the classic formulation of being judged not on the color of your skin but the content of your character on its head and demands protection solely based on the utterly lacking content of one's character.\n\nNow the judges are nakedly leveraging their office to demand a university bend its hiring policy to their whim.\n\nWhile conservatives usually whine about boycotts, they are perfectly legal forms of private protest. But the judges are not acting as private protesters. They are using their constitutional office to bully institutions that they don't like.\n\nIt is an abuse of the public trust. They'll argue that clerkship hiring is their own affair, and if we all only slap on our blinders and pretend the power of their office isn't what's giving their hiring decisions their taxpayer-funded

The demonstrations culminated in a police sweep of the campus's Hamilton Hall, which students and agitators occupied last week.\n\nThe announcement, which coincides with Holocaust Remembrance Day, cited the school's alleged failure to condemn the antisemitic acts of its students. This, the 13 judges wrote, was more than enough to make them lose confidence in the school.\n\nAs judges who hire law clerks every year to serve in the federal judiciary, we have lost confidence in Columbia as an institution of higher education,\" the letter reads. \"Columbia has instead become an incubator of bigotry. As a result, Columbia has disqualified itself from educating the future leaders of our country.\"\n\nThe latter also included a list of demands for the school to regain its \"once-distinguished reputation.\" These included issuing consequences for campus demonstrators, protecting free speech and upholding viewpoint diversity.\n\n\"Justice William Brennan refused to hire law clerks from Harvard Law School because he disliked criticisms of the Supreme Court by some of its faculty,\" the judges wrote. \"The objective of our boycott is different -- it is not to hamper academic freedom, but to restore it at Columbia University.\"\n\nREAD MORE | Michael Moore encourages student protesters to occupy buildings: 'You do have the right'\n\nLeading the letter were Elizabeth Branch and James Ho, two judges who collaborated to announce a boycott of Stanford Law grads in 2023. That boycott came after a conservative judge was shouted down at the school. The two judges also announced a boycott of Yale Law grads in 2022, according to the New York Post.\n\nLast week, the Columbia Law Review pushed for the school to cancel exams, citing the claim that many students are \"unwell\" after watching their peers be \"hauled to jail\" by police. Columbia announced Monday the cancellation of its campus-wide commencement ceremony following weeks of anti-Israel protesting on campus.", "source": {"uri": "abc7amarillo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVII"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_walker@abc7amarillo.com", "name": "Jackson Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Ponnuru", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramesh Ponnuru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Americanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Brennan_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

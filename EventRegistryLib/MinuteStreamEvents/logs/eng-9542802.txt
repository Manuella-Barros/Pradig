He explained his decision, in particular, by disagreeing with Warsaw's policy towards Belarus and Russia.\n\nThe judge said this during a press conference in Minsk, signing his resignation from the post of judge, Ukrinform reports citing Onet.pl.\n\n\"Why did I come to you? As for the situation in my country, this is a protest against Poland's policy towards Belarus and Russia,\" Schmidt said.\n\nHe noted that he is seeking political asylum in Belarus, noting that this is currently an unofficial request.\n\nThe Polish judge read his letter of resignation in Polish, adding that he \"wants to rest in Belarus\".\n\n\"I would like to show people in European countries Belarus as I see it, as a foreigner. It is a very friendly country,\" said the Polish judge.\n\nThe real reasons for the Polish judge's visit to Belarus are currently unknown.\n\nPolish media report that several years ago, this judge was involved in a high-profile case of pressure on judges by the former Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki. In 2022, this judge told several Polish opposition media outlets about a circle of judges close to the government who collected dirt on their colleagues who were allegedly disloyal to the government of the day. At the time, he explained his confession by saying that he did not want to be used by the authorities.\n\nReacting to the current judge's flight to Belarus, Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Monday that he was waiting for a report from the Polish special services on the judge's case. He added that it is necessary to check the previous activities of this judge.\n\nThis is not the first time Polish citizens have applied for political asylum in Belarus. In December 2021, Polish soldier Emil Czeczko, who served on the border with Belarus, defected to Belarus. According to the Belarusian side, the soldier \"disagreed with the policy pursued by Poland in the context of the migration crisis and the practice of inhumane treatment of refugees\".

He has also been in contact with Belarusians for a long time. This situation should be of the utmost concern.\"\n\nTusk announced the meeting of the the Secret Services College for Wednesday, saying it would focus on \"alleged Russian and Belarusian influence in the Polish power apparatus.\"\n\nREAD: Poland imposes further border restriction in Belarus spat\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a Polish official said bugging devices were found in a room where the Polish Cabinet was scheduled to meet. Another official later said the equipment was part of an old sound system in the building, but the incident underlined anxieties in Poland over warnings that Russia is increasing its activities against the West amid the war in neighboring Ukraine.\n\n\"Every day there is new information about various strange events that are directly or indirectly related to the aggressive presence of Russian and Belarusian services in Europe,\" Tusk said.\n\nSzmydt fled Poland and then held a news conference Monday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, saying that he was forced to leave Poland due to disagreements with the current authorities.\n\nThe fact that the judge would defect to Belarus, an authoritarian state allied with Russia that has large numbers of political prisoners, has shocked many people in Poland.\n\nREAD: Belarus begins military drills near its border with Poland and Lithuania as tensions heighten\n\nTusk's pro-EU government took power in December vowing to restore democratic norms after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice party, which carried out changes to the judicial system that gave the party more power over the courts and judicial bodies. The EU said the process eroded the democratic separation of powers.\n\nSzmydt, a judge at the provincial administrative court in Warsaw, gained notoriety in 2019 when he and his then wife engaged in an online smear campaign against judges critical of the judicial changes made by Law and Justice.\n\nSzmydt said he resigned because he felt persecuted by the new authorities. He said he was protesting \"against the unfair and harmful policy pursued by the authorities of the Republic of Poland towards the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\"\n\nSome of Tusk's opponents accused him of trying to implicate the current political opposition in the actions of the judge.\n\nStanis\u0142aw \u017baryn, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda who is an opponent of Tusk's government, called Szmydt a \"traitor\" on said on X that the debate around him has \"turned into a propaganda game\" about which political camp he should be associated with.\n\n\"I pay attention to security issues. This traitor is another signal that Poland is in the crosshairs of Russia's services,\" said \u017baryn, who was a spokesman for the security services under the past government led by Law and Justice.\n\nTusk suggested Szmydt's case could be linked to foreign country's stepping up hostile actions in connection with the elections June 6-9 for the European Parliament.", "source": {"uri":

His remarks closely echoed the rhetoric of the Minsk government.\n\nThe judge repeated his claims of facing persecution in Poland, described Belarus as an \"open and friendly country\", and praised Lukashenko as a \"very wise leader\" who \"has done a lot to keep peace in our regions [sic]\", according to BelTA. He also accused the West of \"trying to destroy Belarus\".\n\nDuring the conference, Szmydt announced that he was submitting his resignation as a judge and asking the Belarusian authorities to provide him with protection.\n\nIn 2021, a Polish soldier, Emil Czeczko, also fled to Belarus claiming asylum. The following year, Belarusian authorities announced that he had been found dead by hanging at his home in Belarus.\n\nIn 2019, it emerged that a group of judges, including Szymydt, ran an online smear campaign against judges, prosecutors and others opposed to the then PiS government's policies. The group was allegedly coordinated by \u0141ukasz Piebiak, a deputy justice minister.\n\nThe episode, which was dubbed the \"hate affair\" by the Polish media, allegedly involved using social media accounts - including one run by Szmydt's then-wife, Emilia (known online as \"ma\u0142a Emi\", meaning \"Little Emi\") - to smear opponents.\n\nEmilia Szmydt later became a whistleblower who revealed details of the operation to the media. In 2022, Szmydt himself admitted his role in the campaign to news outlets Onet and OKO.press and apologised for it.\n\nEarlier this year, Onet reported that Piebiak had been called for questioning by prosecutors who - now under the authority of a new government that replaced PiS in December - are investigating the affair.\n\nPoland and Belarus have had tense relations in recent years. In 2020, Poland began welcoming Belarusian refugees fleeing amid the repression of protests against Lukashenko's declared presidential election victory. The PiS government also strongly supported the democratic Belarusian opposition.\n\nFrom 2021, Belarus began to help tens of thousands of migrants and refugees - mostly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa - try to cross the border into Poland, in what the Polish government and EU authorities called a \"hybrid attack\".\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which took place with the support of Belarus, tensions between Warsaw and Minsk have further worsened.\n\nAt the time of publication, Poland's government had not commented on Szmydt's defection to Belarus.", "source": {"uri":

He has also been in contact with Belarusians for a long time. This situation should be of the utmost concern.\"\n\nTusk announced the meeting of the the Secret Services College for Wednesday, saying it would focus on \"alleged Russian and Belarusian influence in the Polish power apparatus.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a Polish official said bugging devices were found in a room where the Polish Cabinet was scheduled to meet. Another official later said the equipment was part of an old sound system in the building, but the incident underlined anxieties in Poland over warnings that Russia is increasing its activities against the West amid the war in neighboring Ukraine.\n\n\"Every day there is new information about various strange events that are directly or indirectly related to the aggressive presence of Russian and Belarusian services in Europe,\" Tusk said.\n\nSzmydt fled Poland and then held a news conference Monday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, saying that he was forced to leave Poland due to disagreements with the current authorities.\n\nThe fact that the judge would defect to Belarus, an authoritarian state allied with Russia that has large numbers of political prisoners, has shocked many people in Poland.\n\nTusk's pro-EU government took power in December vowing to restore democratic norms after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice party, which carried out changes to the judicial system that gave the party more power over the courts and judicial bodies. The EU said the process eroded the democratic separation of powers.\n\nSzmydt, a judge at the provincial administrative court in Warsaw, gained notoriety in 2019 when he and his then wife engaged in an online smear campaign against judges critical of the judicial changes made by Law and Justice.\n\nSzmydt said he resigned because he felt persecuted by the new authorities. He said he was protesting \"against the unfair and harmful policy pursued by the authorities of the Republic of Poland towards the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\"\n\nSome of Tusk's opponents accused him of trying to implicate the current political opposition in the actions of the judge.\n\nStanis\u0142aw \u017baryn, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda who is an opponent of Tusk's government, called Szmydt a \"traitor\" on said on X that the debate around him has \"turned into a propaganda game\" about which political camp he should be associated with.\n\n\"I pay attention to security issues. This traitor is another signal that Poland is in the crosshairs of Russia's services,\" said \u017baryn, who was a spokesman for the security services under the past government led by Law and Justice.\n\nTusk suggested Szmydt's case could be linked to foreign country's stepping up hostile actions in connection with the elections June 6-9 for the European Parliament.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Poland has depicted Szmydt, who also headed the legal department at the National Council of Judges and had security clearance, as a potential traitor who could reveal state secrets to Belarus and its ally Russia.\n\n\"We cannot ignore this matter,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a cabinet meeting, adding that Szmydt \"had access to classified documents to which no intelligence service should have access.\" Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski has branded the former judge a traitor and condemned his actions.\n\nSzmydt, however, has denied the accusations against him. \"I did not bring any secret documents here [to Belarus],\" he told RIA Novosti on Tuesday. \"I did not reveal any secrets. I am not being asked to.\"\n\nConsidering the outrage in Poland, Szmydt believes he would be criminally prosecuted in his homeland for no reason other than his secrecy clearance. \"It would mean prison for me [if I returned]. Proceedings are underway to charge me with espionage for Belarus and Russia,\" he said.\n\nThe Polish leadership has claimed Szmydt developed contacts with the Belarusian government over a lengthy period.

The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that \"Szmydt had constant and direct access to classified information. He has also been in contact with Belarusians for a long time. This situation should be of the utmost concern.\" Tusk announced the meeting of the the Secret Services College for Wednesday, saying it would focus on \"alleged Russian and Belarusian influence in the Polish power apparatus.'' Earlier Tuesday, a Polish official said bugging devices were found in a room where the Polish Cabinet was scheduled to meet. Another official later said the equipment was part of an old sound system in the building, but the incident underlined anxieties in Poland over warnings that Russia is increasing its activities against the West amid the war in neighboring Ukraine.\n\n\"Every day there is new information about various strange events that are directly or indirectly related to the aggressive presence of Russian and Belarusian services in Europe,\" Tusk said.\n\nSzmydt fled Poland and then held a news conference Monday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, saying that he was forced to leave Poland due to disagreements with the current authorities. The fact that the judge would defect to Belarus, an authoritarian state allied with Russia that has large numbers of political prisoners, has shocked many people in Poland.\n\nTusk's pro-EU government took power in December vowing to restore democratic norms after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice party, which carried out changes to the judicial system that gave the party more power over the courts and judicial bodies. The EU said the process eroded the democratic separation of powers. Szmydt, a judge at the provincial administrative court in Warsaw, gained notoriety in 2019 when he and his then wife engaged in an online smear campaign against judges critical of the judicial changes made by Law and Justice.\n\nSzmydt said he resigned because he felt persecuted by the new authorities. He said he was protesting \"against the unfair and harmful policy pursued by the authorities of the Republic of Poland towards the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\" Some of Tusk's opponents accused him of trying to implicate the current political opposition in the actions of the judge.\n\nStanislaw Zaryn, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda who is an opponent of Tusk's government, called Szmydt a \"traitor\" on said on X that the debate around him has \"turned into a propaganda game'' about which political camp he should be associated with.\n\n\"I pay attention to security issues. This traitor is another signal that Poland is in the crosshairs of Russia's services,\" said Zaryn, who was a spokesman for the security services under the past government led by Law and Justice.\n\nTusk suggested Szmydt's case could be linked to foreign country's stepping up hostile actions in connection with the elections June 6-9 for the European Parliament.\n\n(This story has not

The Internal Security Agency began a separate probe into the scope of classified information the judge had access to.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nForeign Minister Radek Sikorski described the judge as a traitor and said the case was shocking.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAccording to Belarus state media, Judge Tomasz Szmydt told journalists in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, that he was forced to leave Poland, a country belonging to NATO and the European Union, due to disagreements with the current authorities.\n\nThe pro-European Union government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk took power in December vowing to restore democratic norms after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice party.\n\nLaw and Justice, in power from 2015 to 2023, carried out a series of changes to the judicial system that gave the party more power over the courts and judicial bodies, eroding the democratic separation of powers. That led to a dispute with the EU -- one that the bloc only closed on Monday.\n\nSzmydt, a judge at the provincial administrative court in Warsaw, gained notoriety in 2019 when he and his then wife engaged in an online smear campaign against judges critical of the judicial changes made by Law and Justice.\n\nHe had worked in the department of classified information and ruled on various cases related to the granting of security clearances, Justice Minster Adam Bodnar said in an evening interview on private broadcaster TVN24.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We don't know what information he had,\" Bodnar said.\n\nIn a letter he had sent to the president of the Supreme Administrative Court in Warsaw, Szmydt announced that he was resigning his post in protest \"against the unfair and harmful policy pursued by the authorities of the Republic of Poland towards the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThe letter was posted on the X social media platform in an account under the name \"Szmydt Tomasz.\" The profile only began publishing messages Monday, and it was not clear if the judge controlled the profile.\n\nIn a separate post, the account accused Polish authorities, who are strongly pro-Ukraine and pro-U.S., of \"leading the country to war\" -- a message that was then highlighted by Belarus' state news agency, Belta.\n\nSzmydt reportedly appealed in Minsk to Belarus' longtime leader, Alexander Lukashenko, for protection, saying he considers Belarus a \"country with great potential\" led by a \"very wise leader\" and a place where \"you can live peacefully.\"\n\nThe episode comes as Western leaders express fears of hacking and other forms of hybrid warfare from Russia.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGermany, Poland and the Czech Republic said they have been targeted in hacking attacks. Germany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin, and the Czech Foreign Ministry summoned Russia's ambassador over the attacks.\n\nAfter the news of Szmydt's flight broke, Sikorski, the foreign minister, said: \"We've had a traitor before, it seems to be a similar case.\"\n\nIn 2021, a Polish soldier, Emil Czeczko, fled to Belarus seeking asylum. The following year, Belarusian authorities announced that he had been found dead after he apparently hanged himself in his home in Minsk.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news",

allegations he denies, had access to classified information, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on May 7.\n\nBelarus announced on May 6 that judge Tomasz Szmydt had crossed into the Moscow-allied state, with whom Poland has tense relations, particularly since the start of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"We have to be aware that the Belarussian services are working with a person who had direct access to the (former) justice minister... and several classified documents that no intelligence service should be able to get their hands on at any cost,\" Mr Tusk told reporters.\n\nJudge Szmydt was close to Poland's former governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which lost power to the current pro-European Union coalition late 2023.\n\nAfter he fled to Belarus, prosecutors in Warsaw launched an inquiry into possible espionage against him.\n\nPoland's ABW secret services said separately that they were checking \"the extent of the classified information to which the judge had access\".\n\nThe crime of espionage comes with a sentence of at least eight years in prison.\n\n\"Szmydt's ties with the Belarussians go back a long way, (not just) the past few months,\" Mr Tusk said.\n\nThe judge and his ex-wife had taken part in an online campaign attacking judges who spoke out against reforms the PiS had introduced to the Polish legal system.\n\nThe EU and Washington said the reforms undermined the independence of Poland's courts.\n\nIn a message published on May 6 in Russian and Polish, Mr Szmydt complained he was the target of \"fabricated\" accusations of spying.\n\nHe said the Polish authorities were \"leading the country to war, under the influence of the United States and United Kingdom\".\n\nRelations between Warsaw and Minsk have been strained for years, due to a political crackdown in Belarus and a tussle over migrants.\n\nThey have sunk to new lows since President Alexander Lukashenko backed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.", "source": {"uri":

He has also been in contact with Belarusians for a long time. This situation should be of the utmost concern.\"\n\nTusk announced the meeting of the the Secret Services College for Wednesday, saying it would focus on \"alleged Russian and Belarusian influence in the Polish power apparatus.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a Polish official said bugging devices were found in a room where the Polish Cabinet was scheduled to meet. Another official later said the equipment was part of an old sound system in the building, but the incident underlined anxieties in Poland over warnings that Russia is increasing its activities against the West amid the war in neighboring Ukraine.\n\n\"Every day there is new information about various strange events that are directly or indirectly related to the aggressive presence of Russian and Belarusian services in Europe,\" Tusk said.\n\nSzmydt fled Poland and then held a news conference Monday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, saying that he was forced to leave Poland due to disagreements with the current authorities.\n\nThe fact that the judge would defect to Belarus, an authoritarian state allied with Russia that has large numbers of political prisoners, has shocked many people in Poland.\n\nTusk's pro-EU government took power in December vowing to restore democratic norms after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice party, which carried out changes to the judicial system that gave the party more power over the courts and judicial bodies. The EU said the process eroded the democratic separation of powers.\n\nSzmydt, a judge at the provincial administrative court in Warsaw, gained notoriety in 2019 when he and his then wife engaged in an online smear campaign against judges critical of the judicial changes made by Law and Justice.\n\nSzmydt said he resigned because he felt persecuted by the new authorities. He said he was protesting \"against the unfair and harmful policy pursued by the authorities of the Republic of Poland towards the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\"\n\nSome of Tusk's opponents accused him of trying to implicate the current political opposition in the actions of the judge.\n\nStanislaw Zaryn, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda who is an opponent of Tusk\u00b4s government, called Szmydt a \"traitor\" on said on X that the debate around him has \"turned into a propaganda game\" about which political camp he should be associated with.\n\n\"I pay attention to security issues. This traitor is another signal that Poland is in the crosshairs of Russia\u00b4s services,\" said Zaryn, who was a spokesman for the security services under the past government led by Law and Justice.\n\nTusk suggested Szmydt's case could be linked to foreign country's stepping up hostile actions in connection with the elections June 6-9 for the European Parliament.", "source": {"uri":

Tomasz Szmydt, judge for the Voivodeship Administrative Court of Warsaw, who has fled to Belarus, had been under surveillance for several months by Polish special services on suspicion of spying, the Onet portal reported, citing unnamed sources in the country's special services and government.\n\nAccording to the sources, the Internal Security Agency has been keeping tabs on Szmydt for several months. Apart from that, Poland's counterintelligence was collecting evidence to make a case against him for spying for a foreign state. The sources claim that Szmydt has been in contact with Belarusian and Russian intelligence services for years.\n\nMeanwhile, the fugitive judge told Russia's Soloviev Live television channel that when he was still in Poland he felt his life was at risk as Polish authorities disapproved of his verdicts.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said however that the judge, who had access to classified documents, has a long-standing relationship with Belarusian special services. On Monday, Polish security services began a probe to identify secret data the fugitive judge had access to. Another probe into his spying activities was launched by the prosecutor's office.\n\nOn May 6, Szmydt told a news conference in Minsk that he is seeking political asylum in Belarus as he opposes the Polish government's policy. He also asked Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to ensure his protection because he cannot return to Poland due to security reasons.\n\nIn an interview with TASS, Szmydt said that he hopes that Lukashenko's protection will guarantee the safety of his family against threats from Polish authorities.\n\n\"I have an ex-wife - we divorced long ago - and two daughters in Poland. I am sure that once I can enjoy President Lukashenko's protection, it will cover my family too. No one will dare to touch them,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether he would like his family to join him in Minsk, he noted that \"it would be very difficult.\"\n\nSzmydt held various positions in Poland's judicial system. He headed the legal department of the National Council of the Judiciary. He claims to have been persecuted and forced to flee the country because of his disagreement with the policy of the Polish authorities, who, in his words, are leading Poland towards war under the influence of the United States and the United Kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Counterintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeships_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voivodeships of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Lukashenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Tusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People's_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polish People's Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_(Austria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Council (Austria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Belarus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Belarus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542802", "eventUri": "eng-9542802", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 146, "textEnd": 151}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1360, "textEnd": 1365}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He has also been in contact with Belarusians for a long time. This situation should be of the utmost concern.\"\n\nTusk announced the meeting of the the Secret Services College for Wednesday, saying it would focus on \"alleged Russian and Belarusian influence in the Polish power apparatus.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a Polish official said bugging devices were found in a room where the Polish Cabinet was scheduled to meet. Another official later said the equipment was part of an old sound system in the building, but the incident underlined anxieties in Poland over warnings that Russia is increasing its activities against the West amid the war in neighboring Ukraine.\n\n\"Every day there is new information about various strange events that are directly or indirectly related to the aggressive presence of Russian and Belarusian services in Europe,\" Tusk said.\n\nSzmydt fled Poland and then held a news conference Monday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, saying that he was forced to leave Poland due to disagreements with the current authorities.\n\nThe fact that the judge would defect to Belarus, an authoritarian state allied with Russia that has large numbers of political prisoners, has shocked many people in Poland.\n\nTusk's pro-EU government took power in December vowing to restore democratic norms after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice party, which carried out changes to the judicial system that gave the party more power over the courts and judicial bodies. The EU said the process eroded the democratic separation of powers.\n\nSzmydt, a judge at the provincial administrative court in Warsaw, gained notoriety in 2019 when he and his then wife engaged in an online smear campaign against judges critical of the judicial changes made by Law and Justice.\n\nSzmydt said he resigned because he felt persecuted by the new authorities. He said he was protesting \"against the unfair and harmful policy pursued by the authorities of the Republic of Poland towards the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.\"\n\nSome of Tusk's opponents accused him of trying to implicate the current political opposition in the actions of the judge.\n\nStanis\u0142aw \u017baryn, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda who is an opponent of Tusk's government, called Szmydt a \"traitor\" on said on X that the debate around him has \"turned into a propaganda game\" about which political camp he should be associated with.\n\n\"I pay attention to security issues. This traitor is another signal that Poland is in the crosshairs of Russia's services,\" said \u017baryn, who was a spokesman for the security services under the past government led by Law and Justice.\n\nTusk suggested Szmydt's case could be linked to foreign country's stepping up hostile actions in connection with the elections June 6-9 for the European Parliament.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Politicians in Poland, which is a NATO and European Union country, vowed to take immediate steps to strip Szmydt of his immunity as a judge, remove him from his post and take actions to bring him to justice.\n\nSzmydt was notorious in Poland for having engaged in a 2019 online smear campaign against other judges that was sponsored by the Justice Ministry under the previous right-wing government.\n\nJustice Minister Adam Bodnar said stripping him of immunity allows for posting an international arrest warrant for Szmydt through Interpol. Even if Belarus ignores it, the warrant would restrict Szmydt's ability to travel.\n\nAccording to Belarus state media, Szmydt told reporters in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, that he was forced to leave Poland because he did not agree with the new, pro-Western government.\n\nDeputy justice minister in the new government, Arkadiusz Myrcha, said in parliament on Thursday that answers are needed about Szmydt's swift rise under the previous government and why he had access to sensitive information.\n\nSpeaking later in parliament, Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused the previously ruling populist Law and Justice party of ties to the intelligence services of Russia and Belarus, and said the scope of the alleged ties will be probed by a special parliamentary commission. Tusk said Szmydt's story was only a small part of those alleged ties.\n\nSzmydt's defection came as a shock in Poland, which supports Ukraine in its war against Russia's aggression and which has a history of distrust with Russia.\n\nTusk on Tuesday called for a special meeting of the secret services to discuss alleged Russian and Belarusian infiltration after Szmydt's defection. He later said the defection was ''treason'' and vowed swift legal action in response.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bodnar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Bodnar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smear campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law and Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Tusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1714769250", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542802", "eventUri": "eng-9542802", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Prosecutors are investigating if he was a spy.\n\nSzmydt has said that he faced political persecution in Poland and that he resigned as a Polish judge in protest at policies he said were drawing the country into conflict with Belarus and Russia.\n\nReviving the commission would mark a turnaround for a body that was formed last year by Poland's previous nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government and condemned at the time by current Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition (KO) grouping as being a vehicle for a witchhunt against him as it could ban politicians from office.\n\n\"The issue of resuming work or building an appropriate body that will more effectively investigate Russian influence on Polish politics is on the agenda,\" Tusk told reporters after a security meeting to discuss the spy threat from Russia and Belarus.\n\n\"We have a commission (on Russian influence), but there are constitutional reservations as to its operation,\" he added.\n\nThe commission had seen opposition from the European Union last year and has been dormant.\n\nTusk said he had asked the cabinet member responsible for coordinating Poland's special services, Tomasz Siemoniak, to prepare recommendations on how to reactivate it.\n\n\"We have no doubt ... that Mr Szmydt is serving a foreign state, foreign services,\" Siemoniak told private broadcaster TVN24, highlighting the fact that the judge has appeared on Belarusian and Russian television attacking the Polish government.\n\n\"You can see from the sequence of events, how quickly he ended up on Russian state television ... that this is a planned operation which today above all has taken on a propaganda dimension,\" he said.\n\nThe Belarusian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment sent outside normal office hours.\n\nFormer PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki questioned why the Russian influence commission had been shelved in the first place.\n\n\"As for the issue of investigating Russian influence, such actions were taken by the Law and Justice government, which created a special commission,\" he said in comments sent to Reuters by email. \"The opposition boycotted it, fearing the discovery of facts inconvenient to them.\"\n\nElsewhere, Polish border officials said on Wednesday they had detained a defector from the Russian army on the frontier with Belarus.\n\nDeputy Interior Minister Czeslaw Mroczek told state news agency PAP that Poland was trying to establish whether the man was indeed a deserter fleeing the war or whether he was supposed to carry out some mission for Russian services.\n\nRead more:\n\nPoland detains Russian army defector on Belarus border, officials say\n\nRussia targets energy facilities in air attack on Ukraine: Officials", "source":

Szmydt has denied the spying allegations, saying he has not broken any Polish or European laws.\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, in comments reported by the state BelTA news agency, said he would consider Szmydt's request for asylum. \"This is a patriotic, normal man,\" Lukashenko was quoted as telling journalists on the sidelines of ceremonies marking the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.\n\n\"We will thoroughly look at all the questions and I will certainly consider it.\" Lukashenko said he had provided Szmydt with bodyguards.\n\nSince arriving in Belarus, Szmydt has been interviewed on Russian and Belarusian state television and has claimed that he was forced to flee political persecution in Poland at the hands of a government that is under the sway of the United States and intent on starting a conflict with Moscow and Minsk. POLAND DISMISSES CLAIMS\n\nPolish officials have dismissed such claims as absurd propaganda that add weight to accusations he was working for foreign intelligence. Meanwhile, lawmakers from Poland's pro-European coalition government and the previous nationalist Law and Justice (PiS)administration traded blows over who was responsible for letting a man they believe to be a Belarusian agent become a high-ranking judge, without security services unmasking him.\n\n\"We are dealing with the mysterious story of a person who in a short space of time made staggering career advances in the Polish justice system thanks to the support and engagement of Law and Justice politicians,\" Deputy Justice Minister Arkadiusz Myrcha told parliament. Former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on social media platform X that the current government was \"afraid of the facts\" and that Szmydt had been promoted three times before PiS came to power.\n\nThe judge first came to public attention in Poland for his part in a trolling scandal which led to the resignation of a deputy justice minister in 2019. He was part of a group accused of seeking to discredit judges critical of the PiS government's judicial reforms by planting media rumours about their private lives.\n\nHe appeared in a television documentary in 2022 in which he revealed details about his participation in the group.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

BelTA's Russian-language report that can be read here summarizes his main points, which will be reviewed in this piece for the reader's convenience prior to being analyzed. Folks can also follow his regular updates on Telegram here.\n\nSzmydt warned that the US wants to drag Poland into directly participating in the NATO-Russianproxywar in Ukraine but said that this could be averted if his country restored dialogue with Belarus, which he praised for its peaceful foreign policy and especially its prior commitment to the Minsk Accords. He can't speak freely in his own country, he said, which is why he and his friends used to turn off their phones when discussing sensitive topics before he fled.\n\nSzmydt expects to be targeted by a vicious information campaign that'll be aimed at smearing him in order to discredit his disclosures about the reality of Poland's US-backed warmongering policies. Average Poles don't hate Russians or Belarusians, he claimed, but are being deprived of accurate reports about those two's countries due to the ongoing information blockade. That's why they resort to Telegram, which has yet to be blocked there.\n\nThe judge read his letter of resignation during the press conference, asked for political asylum, and said that he'll talk more in detail about the reality of Western politics after he rests a little. He also plans to share with everyone his impressions of Belarus as a foreigner, whose political and economic stability he regards as impressive, especially after it weathered a Western-backed regime change campaign in 2020. Overall, his press conference didn't drop any bombshells, but it was still an important event.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski just did an about-face whereby he said that his country is no longer ruling outsending troops to Ukraine, which coincided with French President Emmanuel Macron's recent reaffirmation of his relatedthreat from late February. These provocations and others from the UK in recent days were responsible for Russia announcing tactical nuclear weapons exercises on Monday. There's a more specific Polish-Belarusian context as well that was explained in the following analyses:\n\n* 19 February: \"The Western-Backed Foreign-Based Belarusian Opposition Is Plotting Territorial Revisions\"\n\n* 21 February: \"Is The West Plotting A False Flag Provocation In Poland To Blame On Russia & Belarus?\"\n\n* 19 March: \"Poland Is Poised To Play An Indispensable Role In Germany's 'Fortress Europe'\"\n\n* 16 April: \"The Russian Ambassador To Poland Shared Important Insight Into Bilateral Relations\"\n\n* 26 April: \"Analyzing Belarus' Claim Of Recently Thwarting Drone Attacks From Lithuania\"\n\nIn brief, an enduring element of Polish foreign policy between its former conservative-nationalist government and returning liberal-globalist one is destabilizing Belarus, which is regarded by them as falling within their historical \"sphere of influence\". To that end, not only did Warsaw back 2020's failed Color Revolution against President Alexander Lukashenko, but it also hosts self-declared members of the (non-systemic) \"opposition\", some of whom are plotting to carry out cross-border attacks.\n\nThose in neighboring Lithuania were recently thwarted by the Belarusian and perhaps also Russian special services, but it can't be discounted that their Polish counterparts might one day be more successful. Poland isn't just doing this on its own initiative, however, but in cooperation with the US and nowadays also Germany after the returning liberal-globalist government comprehensively subordinated their country to it since December. Szmydt believes that all this is against Poland's objective interests.\n\nHe's already been branded a \"traitor\" by Polish presidential aide Stanislaw Zaryn on X, who also accused him of waging \"hybrid war\" on Poland in collusion with Russia, ominously warning that \"he must be treated as such\" by the authorities. Local media also dug up his involvement in a prior scandal where he was accused of smearing judges opposed to the prior government's reforms before he turned into a whistleblower and spilled the beans about that alleged operation.\n\nBringing up Szmydt's background actually works to his advantage, however, since it shows that he's not a partisan hack whose defection can be spun by the ruling party to smear the opposition. Regardless of however one might feel about what he just did, there shouldn't be any doubt that this was an entirely personal decision that he made after thinking deeply about it. He feels very strongly about peace and couldn't in good conscience remain in Poland while the US pushes it into a direct war with Russia.\n\nThe importance of his defection rests in the widespread attention that it generated in Polish society on the eve of what might soon be the commencement of a conventional NATO intervention in Ukraine. It's admittedly unlikely that he'll inspire peaceful political protests against this possibly impending scenario, but he at least showed average Poles that some members of their elite are opposed to this happening. Polish attitudes towards everything are already shifting, and this might help further speed up that trend.", "source": {"uri": "sott.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Signs Of The TImes"},

Tusk and his allies have seized on the case as they gear up for a third ballot since October and following a lackluster performance in local elections last month.\n\nDeputy Justice Minister Arkadiusz Myrcha on Thursday accused Law & Justice party of granting the judge access to classified information and helping him rise through the ranks during its contested overhaul of courts.\n\nThe reform carried out during eight years of Law & Justice rule sparked a conflict with the European Union and prompted Brussels to halt billions of euros in aid to Poland. In 2019 Szmydt was accused of running an online smear campaign against judges, who opposed the overhaul.\n\n\"Judge Szmydt is on you,\" Myrcha told opposition lawmakers. \"The only question is whether it was due to someone's ignorance, omission, or was it a fully conscious action?\"\n\nTusk has called for a parliamentary probe into potential Russian and Belarusian interference in Polish politics, arguing the issue may go beyond Szmydt. Prosecutors are investigating whether the judge was a spy and Poland plans to issue an arrest warrant for him.\n\nLaw & Justice spokesman Rafal Bochenek said on Thursday it's Tusk and his Civic Platform party that \"conduct pro-Russia policies\" and that Szmydt's case was built on \"unreliable testimony and opinions.\"\n\nSince leaving, Szmydt flooded his social media accounts with posts and videos recommending visits to Belarus and excerpts from his interviews including with Russia Today, the Kremlin's global propaganda outlet. He said he's never broken any laws and fled because speaking his mind in Tusk's Poland was a \"dangerous\" activity.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Tusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Lukashenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smear campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Platform", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civic Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RT (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542802", "eventUri": "eng-9542802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on social media platform X that the current government was \"afraid of the facts\" and that Szmydt had been promoted three times before PiS came to power.\n\nThe judge first came to public attention in Poland for his part in a trolling scandal which led to the resignation of a deputy justice minister in 2019. He was part of a group accused of seeking to discredit judges critical of the PiS government's judicial reforms by planting media rumours about their private lives.\n\nHe appeared in a television documentary in 2022 in which he revealed details about his participation in the group.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law and Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Europeanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Europeanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bodnar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Bodnar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Administrative_Court_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Administrative Court of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political repression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Ziobro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zbigniew Ziobro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_02_2022_14_46_17_968969.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542802", "eventUri": "eng-9542802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He added that the Belarusian intelligence services worked with a person who had access to the former Minister of Justice and was partly responsible for the destruction of the Polish justice system, referring to the judge.\n\nBelarusian media reported on Monday that Judge Tomasz Smidt of the Warsaw District Administrative Court had requested asylum in Belarus. Smidt said in Minsk, according to the state news agency Belta, that he personally asked Governor Alexander Lukashenko for \"care and protection.\" The judge justified his move by saying that he did not agree with the policies of the current Polish government and was therefore being threatened. Smidt praised Lukashenko as a \"very wise leader\" and warned that the United States wanted to drag Poland into an armed conflict.\n\nThe Polish Prosecutor's Office has now launched an investigation against the judge on suspicion of working for a foreign intelligence service. Prime Minister Tusk called his government ministers responsible for security to a special meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe relationship between the European Union, NATO country Poland and neighboring country Belarus has been tense for a long time. Poland is one of the most important military supporters of Ukraine, which is under Russian attack. Belarus is a close ally of Moscow.\n\nJudge Schmidt had already made headlines in Poland in 2019. The nationalist conservative PiS government, which held power from 2015 to 2023, caused a lot of unrest among Polish judges with its controversial judicial reforms. Smidt and his then wife took part in a smear campaign on social media against judges who criticized the PiS government's plans. The Public Prosecution is still investigating the matter to this day.\n\nAccording to Polish Justice Minister Adam Bodnar, Smidt also had access to confidential documents in his capacity as a judge at the District Administrative Court in Warsaw.

This move comes in response to growing concerns about alleged Russian and Belarusian infiltration into Polish institutions, highlighted by Szmydt's access to classified information and subsequent flight to a country known for its authoritarian ties with Russia.The discovery of bugging devices in a room where the Polish Cabinet was to meet only exacerbates anxieties about foreign interference, particularly amid Russia's heightened activities in neighboring Ukraine. Tusk's pro-EU government, seeking to restore democratic norms after the previous administration's controversial changes to the judicial system, faces accusations from opponents of politicizing Szmydt's defection.Szmydt's resignation and subsequent press conference in Minsk, where he cited persecution by Polish authorities and criticized their policies towards Belarus and Russia, underscore the complexities of the situation. Some view him as a traitor, while others see his actions as symptomatic of larger geopolitical tensions and potential interference in Poland's upcoming European Parliament elections.In response, Tusk has called for the establishment of an investigative body to probe Russian and Belarusian influence on Polish politics, advocating for the removal of Szmydt's immunity from prosecution. These developments unfold against a backdrop of regional security concerns, with Russia warning against the placement of nuclear weapons in Poland and Polish intelligence anticipating potential actions by President Putin against Baltic countries.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Tusk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltic states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/1715194937_b2089d6b-87b1-4b7d-b6b7-262d26706f35-maxresdefault-3x2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542802", "eventUri": "eng-9542802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The investigation is regarding the former judge's access to classified information. Tomasz communicated his resignation from a Warsaw Provincial Administrative Court in a press conference run by Belarus state media.\n\nTomasz was appointed a judge in 2012, and was on holiday leave at the time that he fled. When reports of Tomasz's request for political asylum surfaced, the Provincial Administrative Court announced that it had requested the Supreme Court Administrative Office commence disciplinary proceedings for breach of professional ethics rules in the Law on the Organization of the Common Courts. The court also confirmed that the National Prosecutor's Office was investigating Tomasz for breaches of Poland's criminal code.\n\nThe decision to seek asylum was intended to be a protest against Poland's policies towards Belarus and Russia. Tomasz believes that authorities in Poland are pushing for war with Russia under the influence of the US and UK.\n\nAfter hearing the news, Poland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Rados\u0142aw Sikorski called Tomasz a traitor.\n\nTomasz was involved in a 2019 scandal in which he was a part of a Whatsapp group called Kasta. The group, which involved the Deputy Minister for Justice at the time, discussed ways of defaming judges that opposed judicial reforms introduced by the Law and Justice Party (PiS). The reforms implemented by PiS were found to breach the rule of law by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) by undermining the independence of Poland's courts. This resulted in the highest daily fine ever issued by the CJEU.

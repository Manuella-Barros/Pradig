Next week, he'll play in the U.S. Amateur at Hazeltine.\n\n\"It's rare to have three people from the same family make a tournament of this caliber,\" PBC tournament director Jessica Brabec said. \"We know how much this moment means to the Gutschewski family and we want to make sure they have the opportunity to play together.

The boys have caught up to the proud papa who's been on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour for 22 years.\n\nLuke was co-medalist two years ago in the U.S. Amateur and will be entering his senior season at Iowa State.\n\nTrevor, four years younger, became the first USGA champion from Nebraska in 87 years when he won the U.S. Junior Amateur two weeks ago.\n\nWhen the three tee it up -- in the same threesome Thursday -- at the Pinnacle Bank Championship, it is believed it will be the first time since Jack Nicklaus played in the BMW Charity Pro-Am with his sons (two were pros, two were amateur partners) in 2003 and the next year (two and one) that a father and multiple sons will be in the same Korn Ferry Tour golf tournament.\n\nTheir tee times are 8:57 a.m. Thursday on hole 10 and 2:22 p.m. Friday on hole 1, an assignment designed to keep the spectators at Indian Creek engaged through the cocktail hour Friday while the Gutschewskis finish their rounds on the 18th hole.\n\n\"It's pretty, pretty special,\" Scott said Tuesday.\n\nUnlike the Nicklaus clan, all of the Gutschewskis are eligible to be the champion. The sponsor's exemptions Luke and Trevor earned were through competition rather than awarded.\n\nLuke won a closed qualifier for Nebraska pros and amateurs. Trevor won the Indian Creek Amateur.\n\nScott and wife Amy -- she texted the news of their unique pairing to the three of them shortly before they appeared at an outdoor press conference Tuesday at Indian Creek -- are the parents of four. Isabella will be a sophomore at UNL who's in the university Professional Golf Management Program. Isaiah, 8, is playing in Nebraska Junior Golf events.\n\n\"The basic philosophy was, have fun,\" Scott said. \"I would have never guessed that I would still be playing professionally at this age when you'd ask me 20-some years ago, but I thought golf was going to be a big part of their life, one way or another.\n\n\"So we just wanted them to have fun with it, enjoy the game, whether it was hitting balls in the house or putting contests. We just tried to keep it fun and light.\"\n\nLuke played for Elkhorn Mount Michael, Trevor for Mount Michael one year and Omaha Westside the past two years.\n\nOf the two, Trevor has been on the faster track. But not by much.\n\n\"They're a little bit different, just watching them progress through the years, high school and college sort of stuff,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Luke was always a short hitter. He's kind of a late bloomer, so to speak, and then tore his labrum coaching his brother's basketball team when he was senior in high school.\n\n\"He went to college just kind of a short hitter but a super-good short game, a really good hybrid and fairway-wood player. I remember he went to state his freshman year in high school and he's playing par-4s and he can't get to them in two, hitting driver, driver or 3-wood, and then he's got 40 yards left.\n\n\"He had to learn how to use this whole bag and chip and putt really well and just kind of develop that part of his game.\n\n\"Trevor doesn't really have those problems. Trevor's 17 and he hits it farther than both of us. He's maybe a little bit more your prototypical young player, hits it a long way. And then, when he doesn't get too hard on himself about his putting ...\"\n\nBecause they're four years apart, the brothers spared the parents breaking up many brawls. Doesn't mean they're not super competitive.\n\nLuke's a little more cautious, a little more reserved, their dad said. Trevor, more on the fiery side. Still reserved, but \"maybe he doesn't hide it as well as Luke,\" Scott said.\n\n\"(Amy) started calling him T.Q.\n\nfor a while because Luke would win stuff and Trevor would quit.\"\n\nChimed in Trevor: \"When he was about to lose, he'd make up rules. Obviously that'd make me mad. So I would quit. And I don't see a problem with that.\"\n\nHow do those friendly family games unfold, some of them at the new Lost Rail Golf Club?\n\n\"It's kind of a crapshoot who wins,\" Scott said. \"I probably rib them a little more and give them a hard time more than they do me, but the last couple times I've gotten off to good starts and I start teasing them that I'm gone beat their best ball.\n\n\"But we just we try to have fun with it. You know, they both beat me plenty. But usually there's some technicalities, somebody has to pick up or something. Somebody takes a bad drop on the first hole, and he sets the course record.\"\n\nTrevor said, \"We obviously want to beat each other, but it's all worth it just being out there, having fun.\"\n\nLuke was asked about any specific piece of advice his father has given to them.\n\n\"I'm curious to hear the answer to this,\" Scott said. Luke didn't fail him. \"I guess probably more than anything I think he's taught us how to be professional, and how we carry ourselves. Handle our practice. Handle dealing with people.\n\n\"I think that far more than anything has been I think what stuck with me the most, at least. Just how to carry yourself and treat people the right way.\"\n\nThe PGA Champions Tour for the 50-and-older crowd is barely two years away for Scott, who turns 48 on Oct. 1. He'll have a spot on the Korn Ferry Tour until he turns 50 in 2026.\n\nOr he might be content to forgo the seniors tour, with its golf carts beckoning someone with a history of foot ailments, to watch the sons carry on in his game.\n\n\"I kind of started joking that I might be ready to be like Justin Thomas' father (Mike),\" Scott aid. \"Like I'm ready to walk around and tell these guys how good they are and help them out.\n\n\"I'd be OK with that.\"\n\nstu.pospisil@owh.com, twitter.com/ stuOWH", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_Ferry_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Korn Ferry Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_Bank_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinnacle Bank Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Charity_Pro-Am", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW Charity Pro-Am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Junior_Amateur_Golf_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Junior Amateur Golf Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Amateur Championship (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-ball_golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Four-ball golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour_Champions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour Champions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf cart"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/d3/7d31903b-51ad-5f6f-ba67-0b673a562cfd/66b320dc720ab.image.jpg?crop=887%2C466%2C0%2C30&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798788", "eventUri": "eng-9798788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-01", "textStart": 5196, "textEnd": 5202}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

That's because the PGA Tour's developmental circuit made it easy for her, grouping husband, Scott, and sons Luke and Trevor together for Thursday and Friday play.\n\nScott, or \"Gootch\" as he is affectionately called, is a 47-year-old journeyman pro who once went 10 years - 3,626 days to be exact - between starts as a PGA Tour member. He should be in Greensboro, North Carolina, at the Tour's Wyndham Championship, but he's far enough down the alternate list that he decided to commit to his first Korn Ferry Tour event of the year in his home state of Nebraska. Scott has made just four of 16 cuts this season in the big leagues and not even a victory at the Wyndham would have earned him a place in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, which begin next week.\n\nLuke, a rising junior at Iowa State, won the Nebraska Junior Amateur in 2020 and was one of six first-round co-leaders and one of four co-medalists at the 122nd U.S. Amateur Championship in 2022 at Ridgewood Golf Club. His younger brother, Trevor, just won the U.S. Junior Amateur at Oakland Hills last month. The brothers are making their debuts in a PGA Tour-sanctioned event in their hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, alongside their pops in the 9:57 a.m. group off No. 10.\n\nThrough the years, Luke has caddied for Scott on occasion, including several years ago at a Korn Ferry event in North Carolina.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott and Amy's daughter, Isabelle, attends the University of Nebraska and is part of the PGA Golf Management program. As for their youngest, Isaiah? He's only eight but has inherited the family's passion for golf. Two years ago, Amy posted on Twitter after Isaiah made a birdie on the first hole of his first tournament: \"And just like that, another one is hooked,\" she wrote.\n\nThis family affair in the game just keeps getting better and it doesn't get much better for Scott, a three-time winner on the Korn Ferry Tour, than a chance to play in a professional event alongside his boys.\n\n\"I thought there was a chance at some point Luke and I may kind of cross paths depending on how long I could still walk and everything,\" Scott told Omaha's CBS affiliate KMTV, \"but yeah, Trevor was definitely a huge surprise [to play alongside at a Tour event].\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_Bank_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinnacle Bank Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_Ferry_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korn Ferry Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Junior_Amateur_Golf_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Junior Amateur Golf Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Hills_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Hills Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Amateur Championship (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMTV-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KMTV-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nebraska\u2013Lincoln", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R.hL8tpu_8K89jKr5nJmOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_golfweek_articles_635/cf52f23ee19946af5161da66e08daf47", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798788", "eventUri": "eng-9798788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

This award highlights Wizz Air's active role in the airline industry's move towards decarbonization.\n\nAt the forefront of the aviation sector, Wizz Air boasts the lowest carbon emission intensity per passenger-kilometer among its peers and is dedicated to substantially cutting its CO2 intensity by 2030. In the 2024 financial year, the airline recorded an unprecedented CO2 intensity of just 52 grams per passenger-kilometer, thanks to its strategic fleet modernization and investment in advanced technology aircraft. Continually updating its fleet, Wizz Air has incorporated more Airbus A321 neo aircraft, maintaining an average fleet age of 4.3 years. Further solidifying its leadership in sustainability, in April 2024, Wizz Air set a new ambitious target to fuel 10% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, aiming to decrease its carbon emissions per passenger-kilometer by an additional 25% by the same year.\n\nYvonne Moynihan, Corporate and ESG Officer at Wizz Air, said: \"Wizz Air is proud to be recognised by World Finance for the fourth consecutive year for our unwavering commitment to sustainability. Our ULCC business model ensures we are sustainable by design. In addition to renewing our fleet and enhancing operational efficiency, we are heavily investing in sustainable aviation fuel, which is the most significant means for reducing aviation emissions in the mid-term. To get to net zero the industry needs to collaborate and bring all the relevant actors in the aviation ecosystem together to ensure the technological development needed is supported and financed. Therefore, governments and policymakers will play a key role in creating the necessary frameworks to provide meaningful incentives to encourage strategic investment in renewable energy and low carbon technologies.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizz_Air", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wizz Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A321", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Aerial_Application", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Aerial Application", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a320-neo-6_b90f7660-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721567", "eventUri": "eng-9721567", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Some groups even had to wait days, even with small children or sick people, and did not receive proper help. Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air was mentioned too many times in such news, and that has consequences.\n\nWe wrote about the last delayed Wizz Air plane on 3 July. The flight from Catania (Sicily) to Budapest was due to leave at 6.25 PM on 1 July but took off only on 3 July at 3.27 AM.\n\nAn Austrian air traffic controller head said Europe struggled with delays and named the Hungarian HungaroControl as a main contributor. The Hungarian company struggles with a labour shortage, so colleagues are overworked. Since Hungary is a main air traffic route, that has dire consequences for the entire continent.\n\nTelex managed to talk to some insiders at HungaroControl, who cleared that the situation was not that simple. For example, they accused the budget airlines of leaving too little time for turnarounds. Therefore, sometimes the behaviour of a single passenger can cause serious delays and lead to a snowball effect. We wrote about the other side of the coin in THIS article.\n\nFlightright, the leading European portal for passenger rights, measured the performance of the twenty biggest European airlines. They brought surprising news for Wizz Air.\n\nExperts at the portal measured three categories: reliability (delays and cancellations), payment policy and customer opinion.\n\nThe overall results showed that Hungarian Wizz Air was the seventh worst airline in Europe, preceded by British Airways and Lufthansa, which was surprising for many Western European portals. Out of the five stars they could have collected, Wizz got 2.60. Ryanair is 10th on that list with 2.65. The best one was Transavia France (3.49).\n\nConcerning reliability, the delays and cancellations of the individual airlines were assessed. Interestingly, Wizz Air is not on the negative end of the list, the first four places went to Air Dolomiti, Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM. That means they are the most unreliable airlines in Europe. Wizz Air got four stars in that category, which means it is in one league with Vueling, Ryanair, easyJet and Condor.\n\nGiven customer satisfaction, Wizz Air performed the worst. The Hungarian airline collected only 1.79 stars, which means they are at the top of the negative list. The category includes how satisfied passengers are with customer service, information sharing policies, and help they get from the airlines, turizmus.com wrote.

This new aircraft, with the tail number 9H-WNM, will enhance the Wizz Air Malta fleet, which operates across nearly 200 destinations. The unique livery was designed by \u00c9va Ker\u00e9nyi, the winner of last year's design competition that invited talent from around the world to create a livery for one of Wizz Air's Airbus A321neo aircraft.\n\nThe vibrant new livery exemplifies the airline's commitment to sustainability while showcasing its iconic brand colors. The design features interwoven leaves wrapping the fuselage in classic pink and blue WIZZ hues, with a refreshing pop of green. This dynamic pattern not only reinforces Wizz Air's brand identity but also emphasizes its environmentally conscious approach, making a bold statement in the skies.\n\nThe winner of the design competition, \u00c9va Ker\u00e9nyi, commented: \"I was inspired by the logo of Wizz Air, which features the airplane as the vein of the leaf. This is why I stuck with the main motif of the leaf; I thought of subtle fine lines with ever-growing leaves, and the signature Wizz Air's colour scheme, pink and blue, coming together. I dreamed up a delicate, elegant motif, leaves and tendrils twining around the fuselage, which echoes my beloved contemporary style, Art Nouveau.\"\n\nThis year, Wizz Air celebrated its 20th anniversary, marking significant growth since its inaugural flight on May 19, 2004, between Katowice, Poland, and London, UK. With an extensive network of 800 routes covering nearly 200 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, the airline has transported nearly 400 million passengers to date.\n\nSpeaking at the delivery ceremony Owain Jones, Wizz Air's Chief Corporate Officer, commented: \"Over the past 20 years, Wizz Air's success has been underpinned by its exceptional fleet strategy. From day one, we have been operating state-of-the-art Airbus A320 Family aircraft. Deliveries of the Airbus A321neo started in 2019 and have fuelled Wizz Air's growth, making it the fastest-growing airline in Europe and the industry leader in terms of capacity recovery post-pandemic, with the highest proportion of flights among major airlines flown on a new-technology platform. We are delighted to continue our fruitful lifelong partnership with Airbus, enabling us to reach the goal of 500 aircraft in our fleet by 2030.\"\n\nA crucial aspect of Wizz Air's long-term development and sustainability strategy is the renewal of its fleet with Airbus A321neos. These aircraft feature cutting-edge aviation technologies and provide notable environmental advantages, including nearly a 50% reduction in noise footprint, a 20% decrease in fuel consumption, and a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions compared to the previous model. Currently, the ultra-low-cost airline's fleet consists of 220 aircraft, with over 60% utilizing the \"neo\" technology.\n\nYvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air's Corporate and ESG Officer, noted: \"We are beyond excited to welcome this unique symbol of our 20-year-old history and sustainability achievements to our fleet. In addition to continuously renewing our technology, we are implementing multiple initiatives that enhance our operational efficiency and investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel. Our recent 5 million GBP investment into a prospective SAF producer Firefly is part of our mid-term strategy to further reduce CO2 emissions. By 2030, we aim to power 10% of our flights with sustainable aviation fuel. Yet the key to achieving net zero emissions is industry collaboration and strategic investments into low carbon technologies, supported by governments and policymakers with necessary legislation and meaningful incentives. We are focused on joining forces with all our partners in the aviation ecosystem on the road to net zero.\"", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour

That's an almost 50 per cent reduction in comparison to vessels mooring at the Passengers Terminal Amsterdam in 2024.\n\nAs peak travel season in Europe continues, authorities in Amsterdam have also announced that cruise ships arriving in Amsterdam will be required to use shore power by 2027, and that by 2035, there are plans to fully close the city's cruise terminal.\n\nBanning cruise ships is part of a broad package of measures introduced to limit the growth of tourism and combat nuisance. Other measures include the banning of new hotel construction and a \"stay away\" campaign that aims to discourage nuisance behaviour in Amsterdam.\n\nAnd in Spain, protests against overtourism that have been unfolding across the country reached Barcelona on Saturday. Approximately 3,000 people took to the streets of the country's most-visited city to protest what is set to be a record-breaking summer season for tourism in Catalonia.\n\nHolidaymakers who still haven't decided where to go this summer might want to take advantage of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi's flash summer sale.\n\nOn July 8 only, the low-cost airline is offering 20 per cent off flights from Abu Dhabi to destinations in Europe, North Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThis includes discounted flights to more than 30 destinations from the UAE capital. Bargains include one-way flights from Abu Dhabi to the popular holiday hotspot of the Maldives from Dh335, to the cultural city of Vienna from Dh271 and to sunny Cyprus from Dh190.60. Holidaymakers keen to check out the coming Khareef season in Oman can pick up one-way flights to Salalah for Dh175.\n\n\"Given the expected busy summer period, we strongly encourage all to secure their bookings early to enjoy ultra-low-fares and discover outstanding natural beauty and incredible history,\" said Johan Eidhagen, Managing Director of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi.\n\nAvailable on flights booked via the Wizz Air App and for travel until November 30, the one-day sale coincides with the airline's app launch on Huawei App Gallery.\n\nIndian luxury travellers are the most engaged in the Asia Pacific region, with plans to spend the most on leisure travel this year.\n\nThat's according to a new report on the region's luxury travel market from Marriott International Luxury Group.\n\nHolidaymakers in India plan to take six trips over the course of the year, including short trips of three to four nights, and longer stays lasting up to three weeks. And while Indian travellers lead the way, they're not the only demographic boosting their holiday budgets in 2024. About 68 per cent of luxury travellers in Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan plan to spend more on holidays over the next 12 months.\n\nThe survey questioned 1,200 frequent international leisure travellers, targeting the top 10 per cent of residents by net worth in six countries across the Asia Pacific region. For these ultra high net-worth holidaymakers, the most important factor in trip planning is security, with 91 per cent of respondents prioritising a safe environment over any other factors.\n\nSustainability is also a concern, with 80 per cent of those questioned mindful of the impact that their hotel has on the environment. Nearly half (43 per cent) want to see more locally sourced food products in hotel restaurants, and food waste is another pressing issue, weighing on the minds of 35 per cent of travellers.\n\n\"Whether it's discovering new culinary experiences, travelling with their family or friends, or looking to forge connections with the local community, our research has identified new traveller archetypes, and provides Marriott International with new understandings in catering to this discerning traveller segment,\" said Oriol Montal, managing director at Marriott International Luxury Group.\n\nAustralia leads the way in terms of travellers that take the longest trips, with 73 per cent of luxury holidaymakers from down under planning a minimum two-week getaway, and 33 per cent taking over three weeks. Indonesians also favour longer luxury holidays, with a third of travellers from the republic extending their upcoming travel plans for over three weeks.\n\nAnd when it comes to travel planning, Singaporeans are the most self-sufficient in the region, with 61 per cent of holidaymakers from the island destination preferring to create their own travel plans and itinerary, versus a 43 per cent average. On the other hand, South Korean travellers are perhaps the least adventurous, with 54 per cent of those surveyed more likely to spend their time in their hotel or resort, instead of venturing out to explore local attractions.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hayley_skirka@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Hayley Skirka",

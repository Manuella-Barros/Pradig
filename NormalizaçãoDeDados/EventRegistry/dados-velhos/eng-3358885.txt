The protesters declared that \"anganwadi workers residing in Bawana, along with their family members, will boycott the Aam Aadmi Party in the coming by-elections on August 23\". The protest, demanding higher honorarium, saw workers and helpers from across the capital, along with Delhi State Anganwadi Workers' and Helpers' Union (DSAWHU), march upto the Vidhan Sabha, on the last day of the Monsoon session of the Assembly.\n\nThe decision to \"boycott\" the Bawana bypolls was one of five resolutions passed by the protesters. Reacting to the decision, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, \"In July, almost a week before the announcement of elections, the AAP government had passed the cabinet decision. Whatever the elected government could do, it did. It went to the L-G. However, officers and the L-G delayed it and now it can be notified only after the Bawana polls. The Anganwadi workers do understand it. But a few politically motivated people are trying to manipulate the situation.\"\n\nThe bypoll in Bawana was necessitated after AAP legislator Ved Parkash quit the Delhi Assembly just ahead of the municipal elections to join the BJP. For the AAP, which won the 2015 elections with a resounding majority, the polls are a chance to overturn their two electoral losses -- in Punjab and the MCD elections.\n\nIn fact, before Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had sent the Delhi cabinet's decision to nearly double the honorarium of anganwadi workers and helpers to the Election Commission on August 4, an AAP source said, \"The issue had featured prominently in our pre-poll strategy discussions. No other government had taken such a measure, or responded to the demands of the people so quickly. In an area like Bawana, where there is a mix of rural population and urban sprawls, these centres are key.\"\n\nApart from this, the other four resolutions also revolve around withdrawing all kinds of support from the Arvind Kejriwal government, with statements such as \"the anganwadi workers will boycott the AAP in the next Delhi Assembly elections of 2020\" as well as \"moving the Anti-Corruption Branch with evidence against the Kejriwal government\". \"The women on strike will not back off if the government doesn't change its anti-labour attitude,\" said a DSAWHU member.\n\nAruna, 45, an anganwadi worker in Delhi, said, \"We've had to resort to such strong measures to make our voice heard. Till our demands are met, we will protest and also withdraw support from the AAP. They don't respect labourers, they don't understand our importance. Humaari Bawana ki behenein nahi karenge samarthan AAP ka.\"\n\nFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App", "timeCrawl": "23:14:00", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 49, "amb": false, "textEnd": 64}, {"textStart": 658, "date": "2017-08-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 667}, {"textStart": 1991, "date": "2017-08-04", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1999}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8717298", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "id": 63, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "id": 301, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "id": 471, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Addressing a rally at Bawana in north Delhi, he also listed out the measures initiated by his government in the last two-and-a-half years for the rural areas.\n\nReferring to Kailash Gahlot, the recently-appointed transport minister, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief said he specifically chose him, so that the issues related to the rural areas could be addressed more efficiently. Gahlot represents the Najafgarh constituency, a rural area of the national capital.\n\nThe bypoll at Bawana was necessitated after AAP's Ved Prakash resigned as the local MLA and subsequently, quit the party to join the BJP. Kejriwal said his government had been working for over two years to ensure that the land-related rights of the people of rural Delhi were not violated and the matter was now before the Centre.\n\nListing out the work done by his dispensation, he said the compensation amount for land acquisition was hiked from Rs 53 lakh to Rs 3 crore after the AAP came to power in Delhi. However, the chief minister added that the decision was set aside by the lieutenant governor and the issue was now in court.\n\nHe also said the education system in the national capital had improved due to the hard work of Education Minister Manish Sisodia and added that there had been a \"major transformation\" of the government schools in the last two years. This was visible in this year's class 8 examination results, in which the state-run schools outperformed the private schools in Delhi, Kejriwal said.

From door-to door-campaigning, to WhatsApp, and the use of social media, the three political parties -- BJP, Congress and AAP -- are not ready to take any chances in the polls scheduled for August 23.\n\nBoasting of a workforce of almost 4,000 party workers, BJP leader and district president Neel Daman Khatry feels that nothing can replace the affect of a one-to-one meeting with voters.\n\n\"We have a great source of support in our workers who are working very hard from early morning till late night. There are 379 booths and we have constituted equal number of teams to go door to door, each with 10-12 members,\" shares Khatry.\n\nThe BJP's candidate is ex-AAP MLA Ved Prakash\n\nMeanwhile, AAP's campaign has been more on the social media side so far. That party has concentrated on sending messages on WhatsApp to gather votes for its candidate Ramchandra, a local. Not only that that, projectors have been set up at different places in Bawana.\n\nThe six projectors installed in the same number of wards, talk about the achievements of AAP ever since it came to power in Delhi.\n\nLocking horns with Prakash and Ramchandra is three-time MLA Surender Kumar who is fighting on a Congress ticket. Analysts claim the party has fielded a heavyweight to avenge its poor show in the MCD polls. From padyatras to personal meetings talking about how Delhi progressed when the Congress was in charge, the party is doing everything to win the seat.\n\nSenior Congress leader Ajay Maken castigated AAP, stating confidently that their candidate would win, \"Candidate Shri Surender Kumar will win the Bawana Assembly by-election with a massive mandate, as the administration in Delhi has become ineffectual and as a result, the condition of Delhi was worsening day by day,\" he said.\n\nThe bypoll is a good litmus test for the BJP to see if the political inroads it made into the Capital, still hold true. The party will be helped by the fact that anganwadi workers - who make up a sizable part of the electorate - are believed to have given up on AAP and may switch. The other problem for AAP is the 'Kapil Mishra' factor who is running a strong anti-AAP campaign in the area.

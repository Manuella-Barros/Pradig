The former Strictly Come Dancing judge joined the ITV talent show last year, with the most recent season of the long-running series won by singer Sydnie Christmas last week. However soon after it was reported Bruno, 68, was set to be replaced by comedian Alan Carr. A few days later Simon Cowell shut down talk that the judge was being booted but did reveal he might need a \u2018stand-in\u2019 next season. It\u2019s now been reported that YouTube star KSI is set to join the panel alongside Simon, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon when Bruno can\u2019t attend the next season\u2019s audition\u2019s due to \u2018scheduling conflicts\u2019. The show\u2019s auditions will be held earlier than usual for the next season while Bruno is in America so BGT bosses are said to have turned to KSI.

YouTube star KSI is tipped to replace him temporarily (Picture: Brian J Ritchie/Hotsauce/Shutter) \u2018Simon Cowell knows KSI is a huge hit with the younger generation,\u2019 a source has told The Sun. \u2018He would be a great addition to pull in teenage fans, which is something the producers are keen to do. \u2018KSI is chatting to bosses in the hope of agreeing a deal that would also work with his hectic schedule.\u2019 Recent seasons of BGT have run from April to June however the next will screen later this year, filling a slot left by the end of Saturday Night Takeaway. During an interview with Amanda and her co-host Jamie Theakston on Heart Breakfast last week, Simon was quizzed about the news of Bruno\u2019s apparent exit. It\u2019s because Bruno won\u2019t be able to attend all of the auditions for the next season (Picture: Ken McKay/ ITV/ Shutterstock) Quickly shutting down claims the judge was leaving the show, he referenced the \u2018scheduling issue\u2019 before explaining a stand-in may be required. \u2018I don\u2019t know. But I love Bruno on the show. I think he\u2019s brilliant,\u2019 he added, as Amanda chimed in to say: \u2018He brings such an amazing energy, and he knows so much\u2026.\u2019 Simon stressed that Bruno \u2018knows so much about what he\u2019s talking about\u2019, while Amanda mentioned how long their colleague had been in the industry. \u2018He\u2019s a brilliant, brilliant judge and the nicest person. So no, I would not replace him!\u2019 Simon concluded.

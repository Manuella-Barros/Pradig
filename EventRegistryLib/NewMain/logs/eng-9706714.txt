Amidst these challenges, there were unconfirmed reports of a rift with his wife, Natasa Stankovic.\n\nPandya faced a barrage of boos and heckles from fans when he captained the Mumbai Indians in their season opener at Ahmedabad.

However, as Rohit left the field amidst cheers, the atmosphere quickly turned to loud boos when Hardik Pandya walked in to bat.\n\nYet, those moments were relegated to the past as Pandya recently experienced a triumphant return. He was greeted by deafening cheers from a sea of fans, filling both Wankhede Stadium and Marine Drive to capacity.\n\n\"See you soon, Wankhede,\" wrote the World Cup champion as he posted his selfie with the trophy before the parade in Mumbai.\n\nInside the stadium, chants of 'Hardik... Hardik' echoed loudly. Earlier, he had been among the first to proudly display the trophy on his shoulder at the airport, and at his beloved 'homeground', Pandya was the first to showcase the coveted trophy to thousands of eagerly waiting fans.\n\nAmid fears of chaos and stampedes, the atmosphere was instead filled with celebration as everyone joined in cheering for India's heroes, including Pandya.

It was evident in an inspirational moment captured by a fan inside the Wankhede Stadium today.\n\nA video clip has emerged of fans chanting Pandya's name inside the Wandkhede as they waited for a felicitation ceremony of the champions. The same stadium was filled with boos for Pandya when he captained the Mumbai Indians during the IPL.\n\nThe Pandya-led MI finished bottom of the 10-team IPL, winning just four of their 14 games. Pandya, who faced the boos with a smile, albeit one that concealed his pain, during the IPL debacle, is now prepared for some love. Shortly after Team India arrived in Mumbai for the victory parade, Pandya posted a picture of him smiling with the T20 World Cup trophy held close to his chest. \"See you soon, Wankhede,\" he posted on X.", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OnManorama"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(South_African_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Miller (South African cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/sports/cricket/images/2024/7/4/hardik-pandya-ready-for-wankhede.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706714", "eventUri": "eng-9706714", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It was quite a change from the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 season a few months prior, when the all-rounder was the target of 'boos'. It's amazing how quickly things can turn around in life, as illustrated by this new chapter in Hardik Pandya's journey of redemption.\n\nA Warm Welcome Amidst the Celebration\n\nFans turned out in droves to cheer for the Indian cricket team at Marine Drive and Wankhede Stadium, showing their unwavering support for the Men in Blue. Hardik Pandya, who had previously faced boos and trolling, was now the focus as the Indian team prepared for a grand felicitation ceremony at Wankhede Stadium later in the day.\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced a hefty Rs 125 crore prize money to be distributed among the Indian team players and support staff following the ceremony. Before the distribution, Rohit Sharma and his team embarked on a victory parade from Nariman Point to Wankhede Stadium in a specially designed open-top bus, adding to the festive atmosphere.\n\nFrom Boos to Cheers\n\nDuring the IPL 2024 season, Hardik Pandya was relentlessly booed by a section of the Wankhede Stadium crowd. Many Mumbai Indians fans were not pleased with Hardik replacing Rohit Sharma as the captain of the five-time champions. Despite the negative reactions, Hardik remained composed throughout the season, even though the Mumbai Indians had a disappointing run, finishing at the bottom of the table with just four wins in 14 matches.\n\nVictory Parade and Chants of Heroes\n\nAs a sea of blue gathered at Marine Drive and Wankhede Stadium, chants for India's World Cup heroes filled the air. \"Mumbai Cha Raja Rohit Sharma\" was a popular chant from Church Gate Railway Station to Wankhede Stadium. Virat Kohli's fans also joined in, braving the rain to celebrate a historic moment in Indian cricket.\n\nHardik Pandya's Stellar Performance\n\nAn important factor in India's T20 World Cup victory was Hardik Pandya. Taking 11 wickets, he amassed 144 runs at an average of 48. Hardik was given the last over of the Barbados match against South Africa, when he had to stop 16 runs.

Amid all that, there were unconfirmed reports of separation with wife Natasa Stankovic.\n\nBoos, heckles and all sorts of negativity were hurled at Pandya when he first led the Mumbai Indians side at Ahmedabad in their season opener.\n\nWhile it was not anticipated -- for he was now the MI captain and 'one of their own' -- Pandya received the harshest of fans' response when he walked out for the toss for his first home match here at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nJust a few matches later, at the toss against Rajasthan Royals, commentator and former India and Mumbai cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar even asked the crowd here at the Wankhede to 'behave' when they got booing Pandya again.\n\nAfter his dismissal in the last league match here, Rohit Sharma got a standing ovation with the crowd believing that this could be his last match.\n\nAs Rohit was leaving amid the ovation and cheer, all that quickly turned into loud boos as Pandya walked in to bat.\n\nBut all that were matters of past when Pandya landed amid defeaning cheers with a vast sea of fans filling up the Wankhede Stadium as well as the Marine Drive to the brim.\n\n\"See you soon, Wankhede,\" wrote the World Cup champion as he posted his selfie with the trophy before the parade here.\n\nInside the stadium, chants of 'Hardik... Hardik' began to reverberate.\n\nHe was among the first to walk out with the trophy aloft his shoulder at the airport here earlier and at his 'homeground', Pandya was the first to show the coveted trophy to the thousands of fans who waited for hours.\n\nChaos, stampede-like situation was widely anticipated and feared but everyone was in the mood to cheer for India's heroes including Pandya, who took part in the open bus ride for a couple of hours before heading to the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nAnd when Virat Kohli in his speech underlined Suryakumar Yadav's catch in the final over off Pandya, cheers were thunderous as Wankhede in unison cheered 'Hardik... Hardik'.\n\n\"The biggest turnaround happened in terms of (when) he was included. We could bat deep and we had an extra bowling option. In last ODI World Cup final we missed him,\" said a fan.\n\n\"The biggest testament is Hardik's mental strength, he was booed in the (first game) here against CSK. But still he did not hit back, kept his head down and kept working.\n\n\"All the hate he got was unwarranted. The owners took him in, he had nothing to do with it. There was no point booing him -- he was our captain but we did not. Obviously, we did not qualify (for the playoffs) but we are just here to celebrate him and smile all day,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem with us MI fans is that we have very short memories. Now we are going to cheer 'Mumbaicha Raja Hardik Hardik'. We will accept him as MI captain now,\" he said.\n\nHyderabad-based Srinivas Reddy, a Bank of America employee, logged out at 3:30am and took an early flight to reach Mumbai only to celebrate India and Hardik's feat.\n\n\"IPL is different from international cricket, it is purely entertainment cricket. I am happy for him, he scored runs and took wickets that too at the crucial times. We needed that (Heinrich) Klaasen wicket (in the final),\" Reddy said.

His own performance dipped, and the team missed out on the IPL 2024 Playoffs. Hardik became the scapegoat for MI fans, and the future looked uncertain.\n\nBut then, in a remarkable turnaround, everything changed overnight.

Despite Mumbai's unpredictable rains, nothing could dampen the spirit of celebration. The streets, especially the iconic Marine Drive, overflowed with blue-clad fans eager to catch a glimpse of their newfound hero -- not just a cricketer, but someone who embodies resilience and victory.\n\nHardik played a pivotal role, taking 11 wickets and scoring 114 runs in the tournament.

He endured a challenging period, often booed by fans at venues like the Wankhede Stadium. Regarded as a polarizing figure within the franchise, each defeat seemed to weigh heavier on him. His personal form slumped, contributing to Mumbai Indians' failure to reach the IPL 2024 Playoffs. Seen as a controversial figure, the path ahead appeared daunting for Hardik.\n\nBut how swiftly fortunes turned. Just a month after his lowest point, Hardik Pandya emerged as a world champion when India clinched the T20 World Cup title. Hardik played a pivotal role in securing India's second T20 world title, with 11 wickets and 114 runs to his credit. Shortly after, he made history by becoming the first Indian to reach the top of the ICC T20I rankings for all-rounders.\n\nAs fortunes have turned, Hardik Pandya has become the nation's darling and particularly adored in Mumbai, where the same Wankhede Stadium once echoed with anti-Hardik slogans. Now, it resounds with 'Hardik-Hardik' chants as fans eagerly await the Indian team's arrival. Despite attempts by Mumbai's rains to dampen spirits, fans turned out in droves. Iconic Marine Drive transformed into a sea of blue as supporters flooded the streets to catch a glimpse of not just their favorite cricketers, but their beloved heroes.\n\nThe entire city, and indeed the nation, is in a frenzy to witness Team India's celebration of their World Cup glory.

It drizzled sporadically throughout the city but Mumbaikars won't be stopped. They turned up in lakhs to greet the cricket heroes who arrived in the city with the T20 World Cup.\n\nA small seasonal shower is nothing compared to Hurricane Beryl that confined the Indian team to the hotel rooms for two days in Barbados. But perhaps even that couldn't have stopped Mumbaikars today.\n\n\"Mumbai never disappoints. We got a solid reception. On behalf of the team, we would like to thank the fans. I am very very happy and relieved,\" Rohit Sharma said amid thunderous cheers from the packed Wankhede crowd that waited to receive the World Cup heroes since 3 pm.\n\nThere were about 35,000 people inside the stadium and as many outside having not managed enter the ground. Hundreds of thousands filled the iconic Marine Drive on which the triumphant World Cup team was paraded by an open air bus. It was sea of people on the street, often appearing bigger than adjacent Arabian Sea.\n\nNot too long ago these fans were after Hardik Pandya for replacing Rohit as skipper of the Mumbai Indians team. They booed him and called him names. Tonight when Rohit mentioned 'his Pandya', who bowled the all-important final over against South Africa in the final, the crowd erupted in crescendo.\n\n\"Hats off to him to bowl that last over. No matter how many runs you need, there's always so much pressure to bowl that over. Hats off to him,\" Rohit said of last over the final in which Pandya defended 15 runs. The Wankhede started cheering 'Hardik, Hardik' as Pandya stood up to acknowledge their appreciation. The hate story between them is a passe now, there is a renewed love affair between Mumbai crowd and Pandya.\n\nThe city celebrates and worships cricket and heroes. Thursday was the right ocassion to celebrate. And they did it only the way only they can, waiting for more than six hours and braving the inclement weather. In the wait for the team which landed in the city around 5.30 pm and participated in the road show around 7.30 pm, the fans' patience never ran thin. The collective energy was unbreakable.\n\nCricket is deeply entrenched into the fabric of the common man here. From an elitist sport when the erstwhile British rulers introduced it, the game has transformed into a mass sport. In the 60s and 70s, when the Merchants, Manjrekars, Umrigars, Wadekars started playing the game, it attracted the fans in unprecedented numbers. By the 70s when Gavaskar started playing, he probably became India's first official icon. Mumbai's very own Sachin Tendulkar reached legendary status with his cricketing accomplishments, including winning an ODI World Cup title at the Wankhede in 2011.\n\nRahul Dravid summed up the Mumbai's passion for the game. \"I'm going to miss this love. What we have seen today, is absolutely phenomenal. I think it is the fans and people who make cricket the game it is. We are truly indebted to the guys,\" Dravid, who will be leaving the Indian team, said.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vijay_tagore@cricbuzz.com", "name": "Vijay Tagore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabian Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.cricbuzz.comhttps://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/600x400/i1/c510074/hundreds-of-thousands-filled-t.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706714", "eventUri": "eng-9706714", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 235}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Pandya was in the middle of the storm in the IPL 2024 season when he took the captaincy over from Rohit Sharma. Under Hardik's captaincy, MI lost form and finished at the bottom of the points table. Pandya copped a lot of abuse from fans and experts after he failed to replicate his GT form.\n\n\"First and foremost, I want to say sorry to Hardik Pandya. I don't know why I trolled him in the first place. I am very sorry. Thank you so much. The last over was amazing. And I want to say sorry. Why did I even say anything wrong about you? I don't know,\" the female fan said on live TV.\n\nThe fan referred to Pandya's superb rearguard action with the ball in the T20 World Cup 2024 final against South Africa. Pandya had picked Heinrich Klaasen's wicket in the 17th over of the match, when SA needed less than run-a-ball to win the title. Pandya returned to bowl the final over as well and dismissed David Miller, courtesy of a superb catch from Suryakumar Yadav, which helped India seal the match by 7 runs.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(South_African_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Miller (South African cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/hardik-pandya-043424879-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=vttwOy.E5kiOboCrtWZKXPHVXoGxrrId", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706714", "eventUri": "eng-9706714", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 85, "textEnd": 91}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 457814414, "relevance": 2}

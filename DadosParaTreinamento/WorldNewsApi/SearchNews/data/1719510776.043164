The event, which took place at the school premises on Friday, also saw the donation of 3,000 books to enhance learning as the students were mentored in career development. Speaking on behalf of Jeje Riders Nigeria, Mr Joel Bwankwot, said the group is not just an adventure group but a humanitarian association with the zeal to contribute to societal growth by directly impacting lives across the nation. He said charity is part of the objectives of Jeje Riders Nigeria. \u201cWe are aware that people like you are leaders of tomorrow. This can never be overemphasised and we put attention on people like you mostly in the areas of healthcare, education and that is why we are here today. \u201cWe have carried out activities across the nation in the area of education because we believe that education is the pathway for you to become great leaders of tomorrow. \u201cPart of our contribution to making you great leaders of tomorrow is the donation of books to you, the students, to relieve the burden on your parents and the government,\u201d Bwankwot said. He said the group has carried out ICT projects in Gombe and Jigawa states, water projects in Zamfara State, and donated healthcare equipment to hospitals in Kaduna. He stressed that the group is worried over the prevalence of drug abuse among young people in northern Nigeria hence the need to carry out sensitisation campaigns in schools using the array of professionals among its ranks to educate students on the dangers of abusing drugs. Speaking on dangers of drug abuse, a pharmacist in the Nigerian Army and member of Jeje Riders, Captain Ibrahim Bwala said in a brief presentation that drug abuse is the misuse of drugs and taking doses that are not recommended by a medical expert. He said youths are now abusing alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine, codeine, tramadol, Indian helm, and many others, which is leading them astray, especially in their studies. He said many youths abuse drugs due to peer pressure, boredom, the need to keep alert, family neglect, and other challenges and called for a change of attitude. On career development, a pilot with the Nigerian Air Force, Wing Commander Abayomi Ajibola Odunola, encouraged the students to work hard to be able to attain their dream-career in life. He said that through education and steadfastness, they could achieve their goals in life. \u201cIt is only education that makes you succeed in life; education gives you direction and exposes you to a lot of things. I want to encourage you all to have your personal goals and aspirations of whatever you want to be, and I tell you that tomorrow is better than today, but the journey of tomorrow starts today,\u201d Wing Commander Odunola said. Responding on behalf of the school, the principal, Government Secondary School, Kakuri, Mrs Phibi Audu, thanked Jeje Riders for visiting the school and inspiring the students in their education drive.", "summary": "Touring and adventure bikers\u2019 group, Jeje Riders Nigeria has taken their nationwide anti-drugs campaign to Government Secondary School, Kakuri, Kaduna sensitising the students on the dangers of drug abuse.

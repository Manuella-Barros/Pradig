In an unearthed 2021 episode of the Grilling podcast with Simon Rimmer, the celebrity chef, who now hosts James Martin's Saturday Morning on ITV, opened up about his time working at the BBC Good Food Shows and one of the first times he met James at the NEC. He said it was a \"properly brilliant time\", despite staying at the \"worst hotel in the world\", but one thing Simon could always remember from \"those days\" was James' professionalism and how he slept in his camper van to get to work early. Quizzing James about his work ethic, Simon said: \"You've never lost that. You were always known as being the guy that would like... you'd roll up in your camper van, you'd sleep in your camper van at times, and you'd do the show, and you've never stopped working. \"Still now, you still don't. Is that because of a love for it, or is it also... are you slightly insecure that you worry about it ending?\" James replied: \"Several things... I worry about it ending for sure, not that I'm pressed about it now as much as I was. But I still care more than I did before, if that makes sense? \"Because when I do This Morning, none of the home economists can understand why I'm in there at five o'clock in the morning. They don't understand.\" He said that he would arrive at this time and wait \"for them to open up\" so he could make \"every single dish\" that he would give to former This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Earlier in the interview, Simon said James was in a position where he could have \"kicked back a little bit\" if he'd \"wanted to\", and he even could have \"become a little bit arrogant\" due to his success, and not put as much effort into his demos. Despite this, James, who previously presented BBC's Saturday Kitchen, demonstrated a \"work ethos\" that embodied the old phrase, \"You don't get owt for nowt\", according to Simon. James also discussed his time at the NEC and how he would stay up until the early hours partying before heading back to the hotel, having a quick shower, putting his chef's clothes on and then immediately leaving for work. Elsewhere in the podcast, James revealed that a barbecue disaster once led to him setting fire to the side of his own house - all because of an Italian pizza oven roof, which had mistakenly been built with wood rather than metal. He also shared a story about his dad, who blew up a barbecue and fired his chops \"20-30 feet in the air\", but, evidencing further that he possesses an unshakable passion for food, James and his dad quickly salvaged the exploded items from the floor.", "summary": "James Martin opened up about his strict work ethic and how he used to arrive at the This Morning studios at 5am to cook &quot;every single dish&quot;", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/james-martin-would-sleep-camper-33102375", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32801200.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_James-Martins-French-Adventure-Photocall-At-La-Rotonde-MIP-TV-2017-In-Cannes.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:38:27", "author": "Matt Davies,Matt-Davies", "authors": ["Matt Davies", "Matt-Davies"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.12}

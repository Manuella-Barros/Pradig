The Independent candidate is on course to almost triple his vote since 2019 and top the poll in the Milford LEA tomorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s a ringing endorsement for progressive politics, politics of unity rather than division,\u201d Meehan tells Donegal Daily. Far-right elements have been a pressing issue in this election, and Meehan says he is delighted to trump the ideology. As we await the count tomorrow, change is on the way to the three-seat Milford LEA. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a huge change in representation in 2019, a lot of the incumbents were re-elected. We are seeing more change in 2024 and I think for the sake of democracy and local government that\u2019s very positive,\u201d Meehan said.", "summary": "<p>Milford community worker Declan Meehan says his success in the tallies is a sign of progressive politics.

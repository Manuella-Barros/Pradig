House lawmakers in a pointed congressional hearing last week expressed repeated concerns that Microsoft\u2019s presence in China exposes the company\u2019s systems to snooping by Chinese Communist Party minders looking for access to American data and systems. Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers his company is not complying with Chinese law compelling his company to work with the government, despite the Chinese regime\u2019s policies of military-civil \u201cfusion.\u201d \u201cI always make sure that it\u2019s clear to the Chinese government that if the Chinese government wants to sue somebody, they need to sue me,\u201d Mr. Smith said at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not about suing,\u201d Rep. Carlos Gimenez interjected. \u201cIn China, they don\u2019t sue you, man. They arrest you.\u201d The Florida Republican said he doubted the tech executive\u2019s testimony before the committee. Microsoft\u2019s corporate website says the company has had a presence in China since 1992, an investment championed by founder Bill Gates. Despite rising U.S.-China tensions over trade and other issues, the company\u2019s largest research center outside the U.S. is still based in China. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green said Microsoft\u2019s presence in China was \u201cone of my biggest concerns,\u201d noting the company\u2019s decision to establish research and development centers in Beijing and in other locations around the country. Mr. Smith sought to downplay the significance of Microsoft\u2019s China business. He said his company\u2019s China activities were \u201cnot a major source of revenue,\u201d amounting for at most roughly 1.5% of global revenues. The Big Tech executive said he could not recall his business\u2019 corporate structures in China, but said Microsoft operated as a subsidiary and had \u201cat least one joint venture for certain activities,\u201d without elaborating. Critics say Microsoft\u2019s security staff has done a poor job of protecting customers from China\u2019s prying eyes. China-affiliated hackers breached Microsoft Exchange Online mailboxes in May and June of 2023, including email accounts for GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, according to the Cyber Safety Review Board. The federal board of cyber investigators said in March the breaches exposed the digital mailboxes of 500 individuals and 22 organizations around the world. Mr. Smith, however, argued his company\u2019s work in China was necessary to protect American businesses from cybercriminals. \u201cThe reason I think this is so important is if you\u2019re an American automobile company, an aircraft company, a pharmaceutical company, a coffee company, you need to use the cloud when you\u2019re in China,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe want their American trade secrets to be stored in an American data center in China.\u201d Mr. Green pressed Mr. Smith on whether Microsoft\u2019s Chinese footprint could give the ruling Communist Party a foot in the door as it seeks to infiltrate the company\u2019s most sensitive systems. \u201cWhat access does the Chinese government have to that?\u201d Mr. Green asked of Microsoft\u2019s China data center presence. \u201cNone,\u201d Mr. Smith replied. \u201cAnd believe me, every time there is anything remotely close to a request, I always ensure we say no.\u201d Some China watchers say Microsoft\u2019s answers to Beijing are not always refusals. Geoffrey Cain, policy director for the Tech Integrity Project, said Microsoft readily hands over its computer code to China as the price of doing business in one of the world\u2019s largest IT markets. \u201cDating back to 2003, Microsoft has repeatedly given the Chinese government access to its sensitive source code as a de facto requirement to sell Windows in China,\u201d Mr. Cain said on X. \u201cAs a result of a 2003 agreement, a research institute at the Ministry of Public Security was granted access to Microsoft source code.\u201d Mr. Cain pointed to a 2009 State Department cable revealed by Wikileaks documenting Microsoft\u2019s agreement to give a Chinese company access to its source code in 2003. The following year, the cable said, representatives of the People\u2019s Liberation Army were sent to the company to receive network security training. Mr. Smith acknowledged he has faced pressure from the Chinese government but portrayed his company as taking a principled stand on behalf of America. \u201cI was in Beijing in December. I got pushed because there was unhappiness about reports that we\u2019ve made publicly about attacks from China, about U.S. critical infrastructure and about influence operations,\u201d Mr. Smith told the committee. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018There are lines that we don\u2019t believe governments should cross. We\u2019re going to be principled and we\u2019re going to be public.\u2019\u201d China\u2019s version of its interactions with Microsoft appears different. Rep. Clay Higgins, Louisiana Republican, asked Mr. Smith about a rumor that the executive reiterated Microsoft\u2019s support for helping China make tech advancements. Mr. Smith disputed the rumor as false and coming from the Chinese government, but he did not disagree with the substance of the statement.", "summary": "U.S. tech giant Microsoft is defending its extensive presence in Beijing despite a China-linked hack that ripped through the Big Tech company's security last year and exposed sensitive emails of U.S. government officials.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/17/microsofts-operations-in-beijing-under-congression/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2023/06/16/China_Xi_Gates_29268.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:12:44", "author": "Ryan Lovelace", "authors": ["Ryan Lovelace"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.379}

{"id": 223792506, "title": "Peter Dutton wrong to claim Australia was consulted on ICC pursuit of Israeli leaders, government says", "text": "The Australian government has flatly rejected Peter Dutton\u2019s claim that it was consulted by the international criminal court regarding the pursuit of Israeli leaders over their conduct of the war in Gaza. The opposition leader has repeatedly urged the government to publicly condemn what Dutton has called the ICC prosecutor\u2019s \u201cterrible decision\u201d to apply for arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defence minister, Yoav Gallant. But Dutton has also gone further by claiming the Albanese government had turned down an opportunity to give feedback to the ICC when \u201cAustralia was consulted in relation to this matter\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThe prime minister had the opportunity at the ICC, where Australia was consulted in relation to this matter \u2013 they didn\u2019t weigh in and say that they were against this measure,\u201d Dutton told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cInstead, they sat on the sideline and had nothing to say about it at all.\u201d But a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: \u201cThe Australian government has not been consulted by the ICC on this matter. \u201cIt is not ICC practice for the ICC prosecutor to consult with all states parties prior to making an application for arrest warrants.\u201d Douglas Guilfoyle, a professor of law and international security at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said the department\u2019s response was \u201cexactly what I would expect\u201d. \u201cIt would be absurd if before seeking warrants the prosecutor had to consult with 124 ICC parties, and it would not be compatible with prosecutorial independence,\u201d Guilfoyle said. \u201cIt is hard to know what to make of Mr Dutton\u2019s remark, unless he intended to suggest Australia should have written the prosecutor a threatening letter as 12 US senators have done.\u201d A source close to Dutton, when pressed to substantiate the consultation claim, said: \u201cHe is saying that the Australian government, the prime minister had the opportunity to make representations \u2013 to be heard \u2013 instead of just remaining silent essentially.\u201d Guardian Australia asked Dutton\u2019s office whether it could provide further details or whether the opposition leader now accepted his remarks were misleading, but it declined to comment. The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, said Dutton was \u201calways looking for a fight\u201d. \u201cHe makes things up just so he can have a fight about them,\u201d Watts said. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, disclosed publicly last year that he was investigating Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks and also Israel\u2019s response, culminating in last week\u2019s announcement accusing Hamas and Israeli leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Spurred by unconfirmed media reports in April, conservative politicians in the US and Australia had written to Khan to urge him not to pursue the Netanyahu government. Twelve US Republican senators wrote to Khan on 24 April to warn of \u201csevere sanctions against you and your institution\u201d if it pursued Israeli leaders. \u201cTarget Israel and we will target you,\u201d they wrote. About two weeks later, Andrew Wallace, the chair of the Australia-Israel Allies Caucus, was joined by 24 other Coalition MPs and senators in urging the ICC not to \u201ctarget Israel in such a political attack\u201d. The court\u2019s pre-trial chamber has yet to make a decision on the arrest warrant application, but Dutton said Australia should consider withdrawing from the ICC. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Sky News on Sunday the Australian government respected the ICC\u2019s independence and would not \u201cgive running hypotheticals on what may or may not happen\u201d. In a newly published policy brief, the Zionist Federation of Australia said the proposed prosecutions should \u201cprofoundly concern Australia\u201d because the Israeli high court was already investigating the levels of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. The federation said the ICC was risking \u201cits credibility as an impartial actor and non-interventionist court of last resort\u201d. Under the Rome Statute setting up the ICC, a case is inadmissible if it is already being investigated or prosecuted domestically, \u201cunless the state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution\u201d. Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, said Khan may have assessed a number of factors, including that Israel had \u201ca very mixed record of prosecuting members of its armed forces for war crimes\u201d and had \u201cnot prosecuted any political leaders for war crimes or crimes against humanity\u201d. Rothwell said the Israeli government had repeatedly expressed the view that its military operations were fully consistent with international humanitarian law, except for concessions made after the fatal attack on a World Central Kitchen convoy. He added that the assessment about unwillingness or inability to genuinely investigate was \u201calso applicable to Palestine\u201d and \u201cthe case of the three Hamas leaders who are being sought\u201d. Netanyahu has labelled the claims against him and Gallant as a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d that hampered Israel\u2019s right to self-defence, while Hamas has also criticised Khan\u2019s allegations against its leaders.", "summary": "<p>Not ICC practice to consult all states before making application for arrest warrants, Dfat says</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>The Australian government has flatly rejected Peter Dutton\u2019s claim that it was consulted by the international criminal court regarding the pursuit of Israeli leaders over their conduct of the war in Gaza.</p><p>The opposition leader has repeatedly urged the government to publicly condemn what Dutton has called the ICC prosecutor\u2019s \u201cterrible decision\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/israel-calls-on-civilised-nations-to-boycott-icc-arrest-warrants-against-its-leaders\">to apply for arrest warrants</a> for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defence minister, Yoav Gallant.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/27/peter-dutton-wrong-to-claim-australia-was-consulted-on-icc-pursuit-of-israeli-leaders-government-says", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e5f6f8a50922d1c4b3210e779a8af98ee8cea0/0_255_7660_4596/master/7660.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:57", "author": "Daniel Hurst", "authors": ["Daniel Hurst"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.439}

It is not the responsibility of any political party to evict you from power. Rather, it is the responsibility of country's people. You've grabbed the ownership of the country's people on power.

This is the situation,\" Rizvi said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upazila", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Upazila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhul_Kabir_Rizvi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruhul Kabir Rizvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obaidul_Quader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obaidul Quader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatiya_Press_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jatiya Press Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537972", "eventUri": "eng-9537972", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

A local leader said that the central leaders are unaware of the situation on the ground.\n\nAnother one questioned the benefits of being loyal to a party that always boycotts polls.\n\nMany leaders justified their decision to join the Upazila ballot due to public demand at the grassroots level. Some contestants were already public representatives and did not want to stay away from the polls.\n\nThe BNP central leadership, however, accused them of having connections with the ruling Awami League. The opposition party has warned that even the supporters of the rebel leaders will face consequences.\n\nAt least 28 candidates vying for the chairman posts in the Upazilas election due on May 8come with a BNP background, although they were strongly forbidden to contest it.\n\nA total of 79 BNP members were vying for the posts of chairman, vice chairman and woman vice chairman from a reserved seat. They were stripped of the party posts for defying orders and contesting the ballot.\n\nThe letter issued to the expelled leaders said they \"conspired\" with the government, which is inexcusable.\n\nAs their demand for an election-time nonpartisan government was not met, the BNP refused to go to the 12th parliamentary elections held in January this year, mirroring its previous boycott in 2014.\n\nBut in comparison to the 10th general election, more BNP members rebelled and contested the last election.\n\nNotably, a central BNP leader even won the election as an independent candidate while a vice chairman defected to the Awami League and won with the ruling party's boat symbol.\n\nSome others joined other parties or contested the election as independent candidates.\n\nDespite these disturbing developments, the BNP remained firm in its resolve not to participate in the Upazila or any vote under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe party had abstained from all local elections for one and a half years before the 12th general election.\n\nThe Awami League adopted a different strategy for the Upazila election this time. They removed the party symbol and opened the candidacy to everyone.\n\nThe rebel BNP leaders said multiple Awami League leaders were gunning for the same positions in many Upazilas, potentially benefiting opposition leaders due to divided votes among Awami League contenders.\n\nThe BNP, in any case, is not sparing the rebels. It expelled 76 members on Apr 26, three more the following day, and another four on Apr 30. In a notable case, Roman Ahmed, who had entered the race for a reserved seat for women in Meherpur Sadar Upazila, withdrew her candidacy at a press conference. Following her withdrawal, the BNP rescinded her expulsion.\n\nAs many as 63 BNP leaders submitted their nomination forms for the second phase of the elections to 161 Upazilas scheduled for May 21.\n\nTheir party issued a show cause notice to them, most of whom had ignored previous notices for contesting the first phase of the election.\n\nWhen asked about the statements given by the expelled leaders, BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said: \"Those who conspire with the negative force and go for the election will always find excuses. We believe no free and fair election is possible under the current government.\"\n\n'CENTRAL LEADERS DESTROYING THE PARTY'\n\nGanendra Chandra Sarkar, who previously won the chairman's seat in Sunamganj's Shalla Upazila, is running again. However, due to the BNP's boycott of the election, he is contesting as an independent candidate.\n\nDespite being expelled by the BNP, Ganendra, who serves as president of Shalla Upazila unit of the party, has openly criticised the central BNP leadership during his campaign. He has garnered visible support from local BNP leaders and activists throughout his campaign.\n\nSupporters also suggest that senior BNP leaders have been discreetly supporting him from behind the scenes.\n\n\"With a political career spanning 50 years, I believe the central BNP leaders are out of touch with the grassroots. They simply issue orders from the centre, without understanding the real situation on the ground,\" Ganendra fumed.\n\nThe central leaders were \"drifting away\" from the grassroots activists and \"destroying the party\", he commented. \"I don't agree with the negative decision to expel (leaders) taken by the centre. I'll fight till the end.\"\n\nIn the same election, three Awami League candidates - Abanimohan Das, Dupur Ranjan Das, and SM Shamim - are also vying for the position. Ganendra wants to make the most of the division of votes among these ruling party candidates and hopes that \"on May 8, the people will choose me.\"\n\nIn Derai, another closeby Upazila in the Sunamganj district, the electoral battleground is set between the Awami League and the BNP.\n\nGolap Mia, another defiant BNP member running for the chairman post in Derai, was expelled and stripped of his position as the organising secretary of Upazila BNP. Previously, he had won the vice chairman's post in the Upazila.\n\nLike Ganendra, Golap has chosen to disregard the BNP's directive. \"The BNP may have expelled me, but I continue to receive support from leaders and activists. Some leaders are even aiding me behind the scenes,\" claimed Golap.\n\n'WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF BEING PART OF BNP?'\n\nNatore Sadar and Naldanga, two Upazilas scheduled to go to he polls in the first phase, are buzzing with excitement. This is because two expelled BNP leaders contesting the election are quite popular there.\n\nSardar Afzal Hossain, who secured the chairman's post in Naldanga's Brahmapur Union in 2011, is running for Upazila chairman this year.\n\nDisappointed with the BNP's repeated decision to boycott elections, Afzal questioned the value of remaining with the party: \"What's the benefit of being part of this political party if it keeps boycotting the elections? How can we survive in local politics if we don't contest?\"\n\nAfzal no longer identifies as BNP leader. \"I don't understand why they would issue me a show cause notice or expel me. I resigned from all posts three years ago and have no ties with the BNP,\" he offered.\n\nNevertheless, Afzal is optimistic about receiving support from BNP followers. \"They'll be with me, and we'll secure a victory by the grace of Allah,\" he stated confidently.\n\nMd Ishtiaque Ahammed Heera, vying for the chairman's post in Sadar Upazila with a motorcycle symbol, was elected Chhatra Dal vice president in Nawab Sirajuddoula College as a student.\n\nAttempts by bdnews24.com to contact him for comments about his expulsion were unsuccessful as he did not return calls.\n\nMd Dewan Shahin, a Sunamganj BNP member, noted that both leaders were highly active in BNP politics 18-20 years ago. \"Some BNP members joined their election campaigns, but they were advised by the central party to refrain,\" he said.\n\nGous Khan lost his post of BNP Upazila convener as he is contesting for chairman in Sylhet's Biswanath.\n\n\"At the national level, our party is not participating in the election. But I am already 60 years old. I won't be able to contest in another five years. They should consider this. What do we gain from being isolated from the public for so long?\" he lamented.\n\nNOT CENTRAL BUT 'LOCAL DEMAND' IS THE FOCUS\n\nIn Manikganj's Singair and Harirampur Upazilas, BNP members who decided to run in the elections were expelled, but their expulsion had no effect on their campaign strategies.\n\nThey emphasised that their focus was on \"local demand and aspirations\" rather than the central directives of the party.\n\nExpelled Jubo Dal joint convener Jahidur Rahman Tushar is running for the Hariram Upazila chairman's post. He was elected Boira Union chairman for three consecutive terms.\n\nTushar said he served the people in Boira Union and had no idea that the BNP would not take part in the election when the schedule was announced.\n\n\"When I had already begun my public campaign, the party declared on April 14 its decision to boycott. Although district BNP leaders urged me to withdraw my nomination, withdrawing at this stage would ruin my career. The people would not accept me anymore,\" he explained.\n\nHe added that withdrawing from the race would be a \"disgrace,\" as it might give the impression that he had taken money to do so. \"That's why, despite the party's directive, I am continuing my candidacy.\"\n\nCumilla North BNP joint convener Md Ramizuddin was also expelled for contesting the polls.\n\nHe is indifferent about the party's boycott decision.\n\n\"They expelled me as they have the power. This is not an issue at all. I'm contesting the election and will do so till the end,\" he said.\n\nThe BNP leader was hopeful to win as well. \"Four Awami League leaders are vying for the same post here. So, I have a chance to win. Rest you can see on May 8.\"\n\nRamizuddin also claimed the BNP leaders and activists were supporting him.\n\nFormer Nangolkot Chhatra Dal president Mazharul Islam Chhupu also did not pay any heed to the expulsion order.\n\n\"I don't hold a post in the party. So, being expelled is not important to me.\"\n\nThe former chairman of Makrabpur Union claimed despite the centre's boycott, local BNP leaders and activists were supporting him.\n\n\"By the grace of Allah, people will cast their votes for me and I'll win,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com",

The party is also distributing flyers among people, urging them to boycott the polls.\n\nDespite the harsh measures, at least 50 local BNP leaders are on campaign trails, running for different posts in the upazila parishad in the third phase of the election, scheduled for May 29.\n\nSeeing its instructions fall on deaf ears, the AL is no longer threatening its leaders with harsh measures. The party also narrowed the definition of \"relatives\" to just children and spouses.\n\nThe BNP still maintains that it will expel leaders who participate in the polls. Insiders say that if a significant number of expelled BNP leaders get elected in the early phases, an even greater number of party members will participate later.\n\nIn the first phase of the polls, 24 grassroots BNP leaders are running for chairman, 21 for vice-chairman, and 19 for female vice-chairman, according to the party.\n\nIn the second phase of upazila election to be held in 160 upazilas on May 21, 26 BNP grassroots leaders are vying for chairman, 19 for vice-chairman, and 16 for female vice-chairman post.\n\nContacted, BNP Standing Committee Member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy \"The [BNP] men who are participating are just over enthusiastic about the election. They want to compete in any election that comes along the way. Also, in many places, Awami League leaders have fielded BNP men to strategically beat the opponents from their own party.\"\n\nHe also alleged that the ruling party is offering money to local BNP leaders who would be willing to compete in the election.\n\nAsked if the expulsions could weaken the party, Gayeshwar said his party's local leaders have nothing to gain from the polls. \"Before deciding to boycott the polls, we did a survey on what the grassroots leaders want. Their sentiments have been reflected in our decision.\"\n\nMirza Abbas, another BNP standing committee member, yesterday told a programme in front of Jatiya Press Club that the Upazila Parishad election was a trap that the BNP had not fallen into.\n\nIn the third phase, BNP leaders are running in Khulna, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Bhola, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Cumilla, Kurigram, Narsingdi, Tangail, Manikganj, Thakurgaon, Patuakhali, Sirajganj and Naogaon. There is still time for withdrawal from the race.\n\nTangail Sadar BNP President Asgor Ali, who is running for chairman, told the Daily Star that he would not back down.\n\n\"As I have popularity in my area, I decided to participate in the election. Let the party do what it can. I am going to the doors of the constituents for their votes,\" he said.\n\nIn the third phase, relatives of 18 AL lawmakers are in the race, up from 15 in the second phase. Around 30 relatives of the AL lawmakers and ministers are participating in the first phase.\n\nRuling AL's instructions for party MPs were largely unheeded as in the recent past the ruling party didn't take any stern action against party leaders for violating party discipline which might encourage MPs to ignore the party decision, according to AL insiders.\n\nThe MP's nepotism pushed the party's dedicated grassroots leaders in a tough spot. Many AL leaders think MPs backing their loyal leaders and relatives might deepen the already existing rivalry within the party.\n\nAccording to AL sources, ruling AL lawmakers are taking the election as an opportunity to tighten their grip on their areas by supporting the candidates loyal to them, while many MPs are putting their weights behind their close relatives, especially children, brothers and spouses.\n\nAL Joint General Secretary AFM Bahauddin Nasim told the Daily Star that Sheikh Hasina wants unity in the party.\n\n\"Every leader should obey the party directives. Those who ignored the directive might face action,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It has also expelled more of its leaders who are participating in the polls disregarding the party orders.\n\nGiving a call to boycott the local body elections as it did during the January 7 general elections, which voters had largely boycotted, the BNP has iterated that no free and fair election can be held under the Awami League government.\n\n'Large-scale leaflet distribution is now underway at the district headquarters and upazilas. The activity began end of April at small scale,' BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi told New Age on Saturday.\n\nFair elections cannot be held under the current government and Election Commission, which has been proved to the people, he said, adding that in the past under the Awami League rule, BNP representatives won the elections in two-thirds or even more of the city corporations, municipalities and upazila parishads.\n\n'But later they were removed from their posts on various excuses through a letter from the local government ministry,' Rizvi said, and added that sometimes the excuse was court cases filed against the elected representatives. Eventually, the ruling party put their own people in those positions.\n\nHe said that many mayors were sent to jail after they won the elections.\n\n'In that case, our responsibility is to be careful in advance, so that no one falls into this election trap the government has laid,' he said.\n\nBNP organising secretary Syed Emran Saleh Prince told New Age that most voters stayed away from casting ballots in the January 7 general elections responding to the call of boycott.\n\n'Responding to that call, 95 per cent of the voters of the country did not go to the polling stations. We will call for a boycott of the upcoming upazila elections as well,' Syed Emran said.\n\nRizvi said that their leaflet describes in brief the massive irregularities and corruption of the Awami League government committed during its three terms in the last 15 years.\n\nThe leaflet also mentions the unbearable stress the spiralling of prices of essentials has caused to the farmers and labourers, he said.\n\nIt describes the crisis arising in all the areas of people's lives due to the lack of voting rights and human rights under the Awami League rule, Rizvi said, adding that the government's failure to control the dengue situation, the increase in the prices of gas and electricity, and failure to curb road accidents have also been focused.\n\nThe leaflet also reminds the public about the one-sided and rigged January 7 elections in which the Awami League nominees and dummy candidates took part in the farcical polls, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the BNP on Saturday expelled 61 more grassroots leaders for contesting the second phase of the upazila parishad elections, violating the party order.\n\nA party statement signed by Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that a total of 26 chairmen candidates, 19 vice chairmen candidates and 16 reserved seat vice chairmen candidates for women were expelled.\n\nEarlier, the party expelled 75 leaders for joining the first phase of the upazila polls.\n\nMany BNP leaders have expressed interest in joining the third and fourth phases of upazila elections also.\n\nOf the 61 leaders, 11 from Rangpur division, five from Rajshahi division, three from Barishal division, six from Dhaka division, two from Faridpur division, six from Mymensingh division, 15 from Sylhet division, five from Chattogram division, two from Cumilla division and six from Khulna division. Faridpur and Cumilla districts are the party's two organisational divisions.\n\nAccording to the Election Commission, the first phase of upazila polls at 148 upazilas will be held on May 8, while the

The candidates have not made significant allegations, such as intimidation, against each other.\n\nThe Jatiya Party has nominated four candidates, JP two and the Workers Party and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal one each.\n\n\"It's kind of a unique, new type of election,\" said Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah, chairman of observer group JANIPOP.\n\nElection Commissioner Md Alamgir said: \"It's a local government election. The candidates do not need party identity to contest this election. Many political parties are unofficially backing a side, although they have not formally nominated any candidates.\"\n\nThe Awami League kept the options open for its local leaders, a tactic similar to the one it took in the Jan 7 national election.\n\nAs a result, 436 independent candidates in the parliamentary polls played a key role in creating an environment for a competitive election.\n\nAwami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader confirmed the party's position in the Upazila polls.\n\n\"The Awami League has refrained from allocating the symbol in local government polls because it thinks the elections will be more participatory and competitive if they are held without party symbols,\" he said.\n\nAbdul Alim, former director of observers' platform Election Working Group, however, doubts if the ruling party's strategy will help increase turnout.\n\n\"This is Awami League versus Awami League. So, a certain group of people will not go to the polling stations. In that case, the possibility of lower turnout than in 2014 or 2019 will increase,\" he said.\n\nHe also believes many of the BNP's expelled leaders have a chance to win the polls.\n\nAlim also thinks the opposition party missed an opportunity to speak about fairness of the election after participating independently.\n\nWILL TURNOUT INCREASE?\n\nTo Shantanu Majumder, professor of political science at Dhaka University, it appears that the polls will be \"not bad\" in many Upazilas.\n\n\"The main thing to monitor is whether the supporters are able to go to the polling stations,\" he said.\n\nWithout the BNP, the polls will not be \"fully competitive\", he commented.\n\n\"The BNP leaders contesting the polls may win in many places. Considering this, we can say that this election will not be totally disconnected to people,\" he said.\n\nJANIPOP's Kalimullah said local government polls are different from national elections.\n\n\"Overall, it won't be right to think that the turnout will be low. It will be better than the Jan 7vote (42 percent),\" he said.\n\nHe thinks different factors in the contest for three posts - chairman, vice-chairman and reserved seat vice-chairman - will make the turnout better in comparison with the national election.\n\nPHASE-1 UPAZILA POLLS AT A GLANCE\n\n- A total of 485 of 495 Upazilas are going to polls in four phases, including 150 in the first phase.\n\n- Voting will be held in 141 Upazilas in the first phase on May 8 because some Upazilas were transferred to other phases while some saw candidates elected uncontested.\n\n- As many as 1,735 candidates are vying for the chairman, vice chairman, and reserved seat vice chairman's posts in the first phase. Of them, 570 are contesting for the chairman's post, 625 for general vice-chairman and 440 for vice-chairman's post reserved for women.\n\n- Eight candidates have been elected chairman unopposed, 10 secured general vice-chairman's post, and 10 women won reserved seat vice-chairman's post.\n\n- No voting was required in five Upazilas because there were single candidates for all three posts.\n\n- Hatiya, Bagerhat Sadar, Munshiganj Sadar, Madaripur's Shibchar and Feni's Parshuram were the four Upazilas where all candidates were elected uncontested.\n\n- Although the ruling Awami League has refrained from nominating any candidate, the Jatiya Party has fielded four nominees, JP two, and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and the Workers Party one each. The others are contesting as independent candidates.\n\n- Voting in 22 Upazilas will be held through electronic machines, while the others will have ballot papers.\n\n- Voting will continue from 8am to 4pm.\n\n- The number of voters in these Upazilas is around 31.4 million in total.\n\n- There will be nearly 78,000 booths in around 12,000 polling stations.\n\n- Seventeen to 21 security personnel will guard each polling station.\n\n- Executive and judicial magistrates will work to keep law and order.\n\nWHAT AL, BNP SAY\n\nIt is clear that the Awami League wants the elections to be held in festivity.\n\nParty chief Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also confirmed this in their parliamentary party meeting.\n\nShe even ordered family members of MPs and ministers not to contest the Upazila polls because she thinks other activists should be given a chance.\n\nShe warned that those violating party decisions will face action.\n\nThe BNP, on the other hand, is adamant in its position to stay away from elections held under the Awami League government, questioning the ruling party's will to hold free and fair polls.\n\nBNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi even alleged that the local leaders who violated the party's decision to boycott the Upazila polls actually had government links.\n\n\"Please boycott the so-called Upazila election. Do not go to the polling stations. Take the side of democracy and stay with the people. Keep the people with you,\" he said.\n\nEC'S MESSAGE\n\nChief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said they are committed to ensuring fair polls at any cost.\n\n\"As emotion runs high during elections, disorder takes place. But we must make arrangements to allow the voters to cast their ballots without any obstruction,\" he said.\n\nElection Commissioner Md Ahsan Habib Khan said no candidate would be able to influence voting because the centres will be covered with a blanket of security.\n\n\"Voting will be halted if any problem occurs at a centre. Fresh balloting will be conducted if necessary,\" he said.\n\nCommissioner Alamgir said the local administrations have been ordered not to heed MPs or ministers if they try to influence vote.\n\n\"All the candidates are equal to us. If someone shows disrespect for the code of conduct or illegally influence the vote, they will face legal action,\" he said.\n\n- Voting was held in a day in 1990 and 2009 after Upazila councils were added to local government bodies in 1985.\n\n- The 2014 Upazila council elections had six phases and the 2019 polls were held in five phases.\n\n- In 2014, the turnout was 61 percent. It was 67.69 percent in 2009.\n\n- The political parties have been using their symbols in the local government polls since the passage of the Local Government Election Act in 2015.\n\n- The first elections on party lines to the Upazila councils were held in three expired Upazila Parishads in 2017.\n\n- The turnout was over 41 percent in the last Upazila council elections held in five phases in 2019.\n\nAmid the BNP's boycott, ruling Awami League's candidates fought with rebel candidates of the party.\n\nAs many as 288 candidates won the chairman's post with the Awami League's boat symbol.\n\nThe number of winners among independent candidates, who were mostly rebel candidates of the Awami League, was 131.\n\n- After staging a boycott of the 2014 parliamentary polls, the BNP backed candidates in the Upazila council polls held without party symbols that year.\n\nThe party has not fielded candidates in the Upazila polls since then. It has boycotted the polls again this time after staying away from the Jan 7 national election.\n\n- The turnout in the Jan 7 vote was around 42 percent. The Awami League w[on 225 out of 300 seats in the 12th parliamentary election. Of the 62 independent candidates, who were elected MPs, 59 were Awami League leaders.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It begins with the second installment of the Subway Series at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, and leads into Major League Baseball's trade deadline on July 30.\n\n\"It's the same mindset: one day at a time,\" Carlos Mendoza told reporters on Monday. \"Come to the ballpark, prepare, you go out and compete and worry about the task at hand. It's just day by day. We've got the Yankees tomorrow and then the same approach. We just got to continue to play well.\"\n\nHere is where the Mets stand heading into the Subway Series:\n\nMets finally find a way to cash in\n\nBefore the break, the Mets' offense had been clicking, scoring five runs or more in 10 of their 14 games to open the month of July. They were averaging 5.1 runs per game.\n\nAfter a sluggish start out of the break, there was some signs that the Mets were starting to regain their footing in the series finale. Francisco Lindor knocked his 18th and 19th home runs of the season while Jeff McNeil belted a three-run shot in the win.\n\nFor Lindor, despite a big week, the task remains the same.\n\n\"It's heavy on the front office. That's their job. Let them deal with that, let them make the decisions they've got to make,\" Lindor told reporters. \"We're here to play the game the right way and hopefully we're in a position where we can help them make better decisions that are going to be not like last year.\"\n\nIn the beginning of their series against the Marlins, the offense had cooled off. In Friday night's 6-4 loss, McNeil accounted for three of the Mets' eight hits and drove in three of their four runs with a pair of home runs.\n\nThey used a supreme pitching performance by Luis Severino, who tossed six scoreless innings with seven strikeouts, and empty innings by Jose Butto, Dedniel Nunez and Edwin Diaz to grab a 1-0 win on Saturday despite leaving 10 runners on base. The Mets' lone run came on a groundout with the bases loaded.\n\nThe Mets left another nine runners stranded in Sunday's 4-2 defeat as the Marlins broke away with Jazz Chisholm's three-run home run off Christian Scott.\n\nMets' schedule gets tougher with Braves and Twins\n\nThe Mets and Yankees enter this version of the Subway Series hungry for different reasons.\n\nThe Mets are hoping to stay inside the NL playoff picture, while the Yankees (60-42) are 6-10 in the month of July and trying to stay within striking distance of the top spot in the AL East.\n\nLast time the two teams squared off, the Mets delivered a pair of lopsided victories, outscoring the Yankees by a combined score of 21-9. The Yankees will send up their two top arms in Luis Gil and Gerrit Cole once again against their crosstown rivals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mets will counter with lefties Jose Quintana and Sean Manaea on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n\nAfter opening the month of July with five series against teams with losing records, the Mets close with three teams in the mix for playoff spots. They face the Braves (54-45) in a four-game series at home beginning Thursday before taking on the Twins (54-44) across three games to close the month.\n\nWhen is Kodai Senga returning to Mets rotation?\n\nOne of the most highly-anticipated returns will come later this week as Kodai Senga is penciled in to return to the mound against the Braves on Friday night.\n\nSenga has missed the opening four months of the season after suffering a shoulder capsule strain in the opening week of spring training. The right-hander's rehab was sidetracked after he dealt with nerve inflammation in his triceps.\n\nWhen Senga is at his best, he is one of the top arms in the National League. Last season, he finished second in Rookie of the Year voting and seventh in NL Cy Young after amassing a 12-7 record with a 2.98 ERA and 202 strikeouts.\n\nHe had three strong rehab starts between High-A Brooklyn and Triple-A Syracuse where he allowed one earned run across 10 innings before being roughed up for five earned runs in three innings in his last outing for Syracuse.\n\nSenga threw 79 pitches and would be prepared for the workload that comes with a major-league start. It is now likely to come against the Mets' NL East rivals.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I got home at 6 in the morning,\" commented Mets pitcher Luis Severino. \"I'm not doing anything, I just feel bad for the guys that are playing.\"\n\nThe 52-48 Mets found a way to get the job done through the dizzying travel delays.\n\nOn several occasions, the Mets and Yankees threatened the lead by filling up the bases, though neither team fully capitalized on the opportunity.\n\nThe Yankees escaped from a bases-loaded situation in the fifth, though not fully unscathed after starting pitcher Luis Gil drove in the first run of the game by plunking Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor with a pitch. Gil closed out the inning after the Lindor score.\n\nOn a pair of occasions, the Mets missed driving in potential scores due to poor base running by the lethargic Luis Torrens and third baseman Jeff McNeil, the latter of who failed to score from second after a 388-foot single by Tyrone Taylor. Torrens was stopped at second base as a result and Taylor assumed first base. Earlier in the game, Torrens failed to score from first after a deep shot by Lindor.\n\nMcNeil's two-run homer in the sixth inning more than made up for his mishap in the fifth, giving the Mets their 3-2 lead. The Mets' one-run advantage hung on for dear life in the bottom of the ninth when the Yankees had Juan Soto on first with one out and Aaron Judge stepping up to bat against Mets reliever James Diekman.\n\nAlready walked four times, Judge seemed ready to reach base a fifth time. But Carlos Mendoza let Diekman challenge Judge, and the former AL MVP struck out looking. Diekman recorded another out and the Mets tallied a hard-fought W.\n\n\"It was amazing. We need that. I'm really happy for him... The whole bullpen saved that game,\" Jose Quintana said after the game.\n\nAfter the game, Jeff McNeil commented on the speed bumps the team faced, en route to their Subway Series Game 1 victory.\n\n\"That was a tough travel,\" McNeil said. \"Probably one of the worst ones we've had, but you can't make excuses. Travel is tough sometimes, but we're able to get a little bit of sleep. I slept till 12:30p, so I got six hours. Messes up the schedule a bit, but we came here to compete today.\"\n\n\"It happens a lot,\" Mets slugger Pete Alonso said on Tuesday. \"I know it's probably a story today because we're playing the Yankees. ... There's really no excuses. We're all going to be ready to go.\"\n\nThe Yankees hope to escape the series with a tie; the teams return to the Bronx for Game 2 on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news",

has been one sided so far, with the Mets winning all three games and looking to complete the two-game sweep at Yankee Stadium just as they did at Citi Field last month.\n\nAfter the Yankees took a 1-0 lead Tuesday night, thanks to a Gleyber Torres home run in the second inning, the Mets' took a 3-1 lead in the sixth on a two-run home run from Jeff McNeil, his fourth homer in five games post All-Star Break.\n\nDespite the Bronx Bombers responding with an RBI double from Alex Verdugo in the bottom half of the inning to cut the Mets' lead in half, the Yankees couldn't get on the board again, suffering their third defeat in five games to begin the second half.\n\nIf the Mets take care of business again tonight, it'll be the first time since 2013 that they complete the season series sweep over the Yankees.\n\nBoth organizations are in luck getting good injury news, with Mets' ace Kodai Senga making his first start of the season at Citi Field versus the Braves on Friday, and the Yankees getting Giancarlo Stanton and Jaason Dominguez back in the Bronx seemingly sooner rather than later to help this struggling lineup outside of Aaron Judge and Juan Soto.\n\nMore: How Jeff

There also have to be enough clubs willing to part with players. Executives from multiple clubs said several teams are still making exploratory calls while trying to decide which direction to go.\n\nUnder Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns, the general consensus around the league is that the Mets are looking for ways to improve without sacrificing much of their future.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of where things stand for the Mets regarding the trade deadline based on conversations with league sources.\n\nThe Mets have told interested teams that it's unlikely they will trade slugging first baseman Pete Alonso, league sources said.\n\nThat should come as little surprise. The Mets (50-48) headed into Monday's game in a three-way tie for the third wild-card spot. And though Alonso is an impending free agent, he's a crucial part of their lineup as a homegrown star.\n\nThough there's an industry perception that the Mets' leadership group will consider all options, people familiar with the matter said that it'd be unlikely New York deals Alonso even in a scenario in which it stumbles a bit before the deadline.\n\nIf the Mets stay in playoff contention, they will look to add to their bullpen, but it would be surprising if they traded top prospects for a rental reliever, league sources said.\n\nThere are a few reasons such an approach could make sense for the Mets even though their bullpen is sorely in need of help, industry sources said.\n\nWhen he led the Milwaukee Brewers, Stearns generally refrained from trading top prospects for big-time rental relievers.\n\nThere are a couple of examples of trades involving Stearns acquiring a reliever who worked out for the Brewers. In 2018, they acquired righty Joakim Soria from the Chicago White Sox for Kodi Medeiros and Wilber Perez. Soria, who had a $1 million buyout for a mutual option in 2019, had a 4.09 ERA in 22 innings for the Brewers. The next year, Stearns acquired Drew Pomeranz and Ray Black from the San Francisco Giants in exchange for Mauricio Dubon. Pomeranz had a 5.68 ERA working as mostly a starting pitcher for the Giants but moved to the bullpen for the Brewers and produced a sparkling 2.39 ERA in 26 1/3 innings.\n\nOne example that did not work out for Stearns: In 2021, the Brewers acquired lefty Daniel Norris from the Detroit Tigers for right-hander Reese Olson. At the time, people within the Brewers liked Olson, but he was not rated especially high as a prospect. He ended up blossoming in Detroit. Norris, on the other hand, had a 5.89 ERA in 36 2/3 innings with Detroit and was worse in Milwaukee (6.64 ERA in 20 1/3 innings).\n\nThose types of trades are more likely representative of what the Mets might do if they look to upgrade their bullpen.\n\nOf course, Stearns is no longer in Milwaukee, and he's operating in a different world with Steve Cohen as owner.\n\nSince the Mets are looking for ways to improve without sacrificing much from their future, another trade similar to the acquisition of reliever Phil Maton for the Tampa Bay Rays would be a realistic expectation. In that trade, the Mets absorbed Maton's salary. Other relievers fit a similar description. From a purely speculative standpoint, Toronto Blue Jays reliever Chad Green, for example, is signed beyond this season with a salary of $24 million across 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn the meantime and as depth, the Mets have internal options they may try out in the bullpen after making recent waiver pickups.\n\nIn the minor leagues, starter Brandon Sproat has garnered serious hype as a breakout candidate after excelling with High-A Brooklyn and Double-A Binghamton. But it's more likely that he stays in the minor leagues for 2024, according to people familiar with the club's thinking.\n\nLeague sources indicated that despite the expected return of Kodai Senga this week, the Mets would be reluctant to deal from their starting rotation unless they get an offer that they deem too good to pass up.\n\nSenga, who is expected to make his season debut Friday after lingering on the injured list since February, should help the Mets, but he doesn't change their depth because they plan to utilize a six-man rotation.\n\nBeyond Senga, the Mets' rotation includes Jose Quintana, Sean Manaea, Christian Scott, David Peterson and Luis Severino. Quintana and Severino are set to be free agents after the season. Manaea holds a player option for 2025.\n\nThe Mets could deal from the group and be OK. They could summon Tylor Megill from the minor leagues or move Jose Butt\u00f3 into the rotation from the bullpen. But Butt\u00f3 has performed well in a bullpen that needs him. And removing any starter hurts the Mets' depth in a rotation where workload across the group remains a significant question in the second half.\n\nA handful of contending teams need starting pitching, so it would not be surprising to see the Mets listen with an open (if reluctant) mind.\n\nThe Mets could upgrade their bench, particularly because of the lack of offensive production without Starling Marte (knee), whose status remains murky despite starting baseball activities over the weekend.\n\nSince Marte's last game on June 22, the Mets have a 0.0 fWAR in right field -- replacement level value -- using a combination of Jeff McNeil, Tyrone Taylor and DJ Stewart. The way some within the club see things, the production there has sort of a wash, though. The offense was better with Marte -- .698 OPS in right field with him, .650 OPS from right field without him -- but the defense has been better without him.\n\nIn theory, the Mets would have an interest in upgrading the total production from right field, but league sources indicated that the cost might be too high. Generally speaking, it's tougher to add at such positions at the deadline without giving up valuable prospects.\n\nSome of the biggest names generating buzz this deadline include players under club control such as outfielder Luis Robert and pitcher Garrett Crochet from the Chicago White Sox and outfielder/second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. of the Miami Marlins. Could the Mets get involved? Other clubs may be able to offer better packages; it has not been a banner year for the Mets' farm system in regards to health and production. But given Stearns' creativity in the past with trading for players under club control -- Christian Yelich is the most well-known example -- nothing should be ruled out.", "source": {"uri":

However, the Mets' would respond, jumping out to a 3-1 lead in the sixth on a two-run home run from Jeff McNeil, his fourth homer in five games post All-Star Break.\n\nDespite the Bronx Bombers responding with an RBI double from Alex Verdugo in the bottom half of the inning to cut the Mets' lead in half, the Yankees couldn't get on the board again, suffering their third defeat in five games to begin the second half.\n\nIf the Mets take care of business again tonight, it'll be the first time since 2013 that they complete the season series sweep over the Yankees.\n\nBoth organizations are in luck getting good injury news, with Mets' ace Kodai Senga making his first start of the season at Citi Field versus the Braves on Friday, and the Yankees getting Giancarlo Stanton and Jaason Dominguez back in the Bronx seemingly sooner rather than later to help this struggling lineup outside of Judge and Soto.\n\nMore: How Jeff McNeil went from zero to hero in Mets' Subway Series win over Yankees\n\nHere are the starting lineups for the Subway Series regular-season finale between the Yankees and Mets tonight from Yankee Stadium:", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleyber_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gleyber Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Verdugo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Verdugo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodai_Senga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kodai Senga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eIgPa9iAG4zEhQS2jCrocQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNTAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-bergen-record/9c1e9e09773a61d49b385e9f214f4adc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They held a one-game edge over the Diamondbacks and Padres for the final Wild Card spot in the National League.\n\nThis weekend, however, the Mets stumbled against the Marlins, dropping two out of three games to drop back to 50-48, entering Monday in a three-way tie with Diamondbacks and Padres for the final spot.\n\nThe close to the month of July figures to be a telling one for the Mets, beginning with the second installment of the Subway Series at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, and leading into Major League Baseball's trade deadline on July 30.\n\nHere is where the Mets stand heading into the Subway Series:\n\nMets lineup not cashing in\n\nBefore the break, the Mets' offense had been clicking, scoring five runs or more in 10 of their 14 games to open the month of July. They were averaging 5.1 runs per game.\n\nIn the beginning of their series against the Marlins, the offense cooled off. In Friday night's 6-4 loss, Jeff McNeil accounted for three of the Mets' eight hits and drove in three of their four runs with a pair of home runs.\n\nThey used a supreme pitching performance by Luis Severino, who tossed six scoreless innings with seven strikeouts, and empty innings by Jose Butto, Dedniel Nunez and Edwin Diaz to grab a 1-0 win on Saturday despite leaving 10 runners on base. The Mets' lone run came on a groundout with the bases loaded.\n\nThe Mets left another nine runners stranded in Sunday's 4-2 defeat as the Marlins broke away with Jazz Chisholm's three-run home run off Christian Scott.\n\nThe once-scalding-hot Brandon Nimmo is 1-for-11 out of the break.\n\nMets' schedule gets tougher with Braves and Twins\n\nThe Mets and Yankees enter this version of the Subway Series hungry for different reasons.\n\nThe Mets are hoping to stay inside the NL playoff picture, while the Yankees (59-42) are 5-10 in the month of July and trying to stay within striking distance of the top spot in the AL East.\n\nLast time the two teams squared off, the Mets delivered a pair of lopsided victories, outscoring the Yankees by a combined score of 21-9. The Yankees will send up their two top arms in Luis Gil and Gerrit Cole once again against their crosstown rivals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mets will counter with lefties David Peterson and Jose Quintana on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n\nAfter opening the month of July with five series against teams with losing records, the Mets close with three teams in the mix for playoff spots. They face the Braves (54-44) in a four-game series at home beginning Thursday before taking on the Twins (54-44) across three games to close the month.\n\nWhen is Kodai Senga returning to Mets rotation?\n\nOne of the most highly-anticipated returns will come later this week as Kodai Senga is penciled in to return to the mound against the Braves on Friday night.\n\nSenga has missed the opening four months of the season after suffering a shoulder capsule strain in the opening week of spring training. The right-hander's rehab was sidetracked after he dealt with nerve inflammation in his triceps.\n\nWhen Senga is at his best, he is one of the top arms in the National League. Last season, he finished second in Rookie of the Year voting and seventh in NL Cy Young after amassing a 12-7 record with a 2.98 ERA and 202 strikeouts.\n\nHe had three strong rehab starts between High-A Brooklyn and Triple-A Syracuse where he allowed one earned run across 10 innings before being roughed up for five earned runs in three innings in his last outing for Syracuse.\n\nSenga threw 79 pitches and would be prepared for the workload that comes with a major-league start. It is now likely to come against the Mets' NL East rivals.", "source": {"uri": "eu.poconorecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocono Record"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Judge has light tower power and an effortless swing. The six-time All-Star also has a rocket of an arm from the outfield. He's eighth in the league in batting average (.309) while ranking first in home runs (35), RBI (89) and OPS (1.114). In Monday's contest against the Rays, he was 2-of-5 with two base hits.\n\nRight fielder Juan Soto is one of the top power hitters in the game. Soto does a great job adjusting when at the dish and isn't overly aggressive. He has the ability to make consistent contact due to his plate coverage. The 25-year-old is ninth in the league in batting average (.308), sixth in home runs (25), tied for fifth in RBI (71) and third in OPS (1.020). On July 22 against the Rays, he was 3-of-5 with two homers and four RBI. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back the Mets\n\nShortstop Francisco Lindor is an athletic playmaker for the Mets. Lindor owns a strong arm as a rangy defender but is also a well-rounded offensive hitter. The 30-year-old is currently leading the team in batting average (.256), home runs (19) and hits (103) with 55 RBI. On Monday against the Marlins, he went 2-of-4 with two solo homers.\n\nFirst baseman Pete Alonso continues to be an impactful slugger. Alonso has a terrific pop in his swing with the plate coverage to push the ball into any gap. The four-time All-Star is batting .244 with 19 dingers and 51 RBI. In Tuesday's win, Alonso went 2-of-4 with two singles.

The victory capped a day in which they returned from a 6-4 win in Miami at around 5 a.m., due to a flight delay.\n\nAfter Jeff McNeil hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the sixth inning, the Mets are attempting to go 4-0 against the Yankees in 2024 and sweep the season series for the second time (2013).\n\n\"We've had travel delays before,\" McNeil said after hitting his fourth homer in five games since the All-Star break. \"We were all prepared, and we showed it out there.\n\nThe road win gave the Mets a 30-15 record since falling to 22-33 following their 10-3 home loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 29.\n\nWhile the Mets were tumbling their way under .500, the Yankees were in the midst of winning 50 of their first 72 games. Since June 14, the Yankees are 10-21 in their past 31, including a 5-12 record at home.\n\nGleyber Torres homered and Alex Verdugo hit an RBI double on Tuesday, but the Yankees were 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position. Juan Soto went 0-for-4 before drawing a walk in the ninth, and Aaron Judge drew four walks for the fifth time in his career before striking out in the ninth against Jake Diekman.\n\n\"We've seen that some teams take that approach,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after a game in which J.D. Davis hit cleanup behind Soto and Judge. \"We'll get the middle of our order settled a bit and it changes the equation a little bit. There's going to be times when teams take that approach. We just got to get the middle of our order more settled and, hopefully, that will come back to bite teams when they do it and force them to go after Aaron.\"\n\nThe Yankees will try to avoid the season series sweep by sending a fully stretched out Gerrit Cole (3-1, 4.60 ERA) to the mound for his seventh start of the season. He missed the first 75 games while dealing with right elbow inflammation.\n\nSince allowing six runs on seven hits -- including four homers -- in four innings during a 9-7 loss to the Mets on June 25, Cole is 3-0 with a 2.95 ERA in his past four outings. On Friday, he allowed one run on six hits in six innings in a 6-1 home win over the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nCole is 2-3 with a 6.64 ERA in eight career starts against the Mets. As a Yankee, he is 0-1 with a 7.43 ERA in three starts against the Mets\n\nLeft-hander Sean Manaea (6-4, 3.73) starts for the Mets and attempts to rebound from one of his worst starts this season. Manaea was 3-0 with a 2.37 ERA in six starts before allowing five runs on eight hits in five innings in Friday's 6-4 defeat at Miami where he took his first loss since June 8.\n\nManaea is 2-3 with a 3.89 ERA in seven career starts against the Yankees and has allowed two earned runs in 17 1/3 innings in three previous appearances at Yankee Stadium. He last faced the Yankees on June 26 when he allowed two hits in five innings of a 12-2 win.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton

After walking Juan Soto with one out, the veteran lefty froze Aaron Judge with a 96 mph fastball on the inside corner for a called third strike, then retired rookie Ben Rice on a game-ending grounder.\n\n\"He showed us a lot right there,\" McNeil said.\n\nThe Mets had walked Judge his first four times up, once intentionally, but the Yankees couldn't capitalize.\n\n\"I know how hot he is right now,\" Quintana said.\n\nOf the 19 pitches Judge saw, the only four in the strike zone were thrown by Diekman in the ninth.\n\n\"The last heater was spotted perfectly,\" Diekman said. \"I just challenged him and made quality pitches.\"\n\nJudge insisted he wasn't frustrated by the Mets' approach.\n\n\"I think they're just trying to be a little careful and you've just got to pass the baton to the next guy,\" he said. \"It's part of it. It's a team game. Even if I went 4 for 4 today, we still might not win. So it's just about, if I get a pitch to hit I've got to do some damage on it.\"\n\nGleyber Torres homered early and Alex Verdugo had an RBI double for the scuffling Yankees. Rookie right-hander Luis Gil struck out six in five solid innings, yielding his only run when he plunked Francisco Lindor with a bases-loaded pitch in the fifth.\n\nThe score was 1-all when Pete Alonso greeted Michael Tonkin (3-4), cut twice by the Mets early this season, with a leadoff double in the sixth. One out later, McNeil launched his ninth home run of the year -- fourth in five games since the All-Star break -- to put the Mets ahead for good.\n\n\"More confident. I feel like my swing is right where it needs to be,\" McNeil said. \"I feel a lot better. I feel like myself. ... I'm swinging the bat freely. I'm trying to get a good pitch I can drive.\"\n\nAfter recovering from a fever last weekend, Quintana permitted one run and three hits over five innings in his first start since the break. He struck out six and walked five.\n\nIt was another feel-good win for the sleep-deprived Mets, who arrived home in the wee hours Tuesday morning after their flight from Miami was delayed.\n\n\"We've had travel delays before,\" McNeil said. \"We were all prepared, and we showed it out there.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: Rookie RHP Christian Scott was placed on the 15-day injured list with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. Mendoza said Scott will be examined by multiple doctors before it's determined how much time he could miss. ... RHP Sean Reid-Foley (shoulder impingement) faced hitters Monday and hopes to make a rehab appearance Thursday with High-A Brooklyn.\n\nYankees: OF Jasson Dom\u00ednguez (oblique strain) took live batting practice Monday at the team's complex in Florida and is headed to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to ramp up. He could be playing games within the week. \"So he's getting close,\" manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees ace Gerrit Cole (3-1, 4.60 ERA) starts Wednesday night against LHP Sean Manaea (6-4, 3.73) as the Mets try to sweep the season series.\n\nCole was tagged by the Mets for six runs and seven hits -- including four homers -- over four innings June 25 at Citi Field in his second

The Mets earned 9-7 and 12-2 victories in the first two meetings this season. The Mets (51-48), who are third in the National League East, are 9-4 over their last 13 games. The Yankees (60-42), second in the American League East, are 5-5 in their last 10 games. The Yankees lead the all-time series 84-65, including a 44-29 edge in games played at Yankee Stadium.\n\nFirst pitch from Yankee Stadium is set for 7:05 p.m. ET. The Yankees are a -159 favorite on the money line (risk $159 to win $100) in the latest Mets vs. Yankees odds from SportsLine consensus, while the total number of runs Vegas thinks will be scored, or the over/under, is 8.5. Before making any Yankees vs. Mets picks, be sure to see the MLB predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven computer simulation model.\n\nThe SportsLine Projection Model simulates every MLB game 10,000 times. It entered Week 18 of the 2024 MLB season 53-44 on all-top rated MLB picks this season. Dating back to last season, it is on a 24-11 roll on top-rated run-line picks (+877). Anybody following has seen strong returns.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on Mets vs. Yankees and just locked in its picks and MLB predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see the model's picks.

He is coming off a solid performance in his last outing, a 6-1 victory at Baltimore on July 13. In that game, he pitched six innings, allowing five hits, one earned run and one walk, while striking out seven. He has pitched well this season, allowing three or more earned runs in just six of 19 starts. In 102 innings this year, he has surrendered 62 hits, 36 earned runs and 49 walks, while striking out 118.\n\nOffensively, Juan Soto has been red hot. In Monday's 9-1 win over the Tampa Bay Rays, he was 3-for-5 with a double, two homers and four RBI. In the four-game series with Tampa Bay, Soto was a blistering 11-for-18 (.611) with four doubles, two homers and five RBI. In 98 games this season, he is batting .311 with 19 doubles, four triples, 25 homers and 71 RBI. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back the Mets\n\nLeft-hander Jose Quintana (4-6, 4.13 ERA) will start for the Mets. Quintana has won three of his last four decisions, including a 7-5 victory over Washington on July 9. In that game, he pitched seven innings, allowing just one hit and one walk, while striking out five. In his last outing, he took the loss in an 8-5 defeat at Colorado on July 14. In that game, he allowed six hits, five earned runs and one walk, while striking out eight.\n\nShortstop Francisco Lindor continues to be a bright spot on offense for the Mets. In 99 games this season, he is hitting .256 with 26 doubles, 19 homers, 54 RBI and 66 runs scored. He has a seven-game hitting streak, including a 2-for-4 performance with two home runs in Monday's 6-4 win over the Miami Marlins. In two games against the Yankees this season, he is 4-for-10 with three doubles.

New York is 7-3 straight up in their last 10 games. The Mets are 49-51 ATS this season.\n\nThe New York Yankees are 60-43 straight up this year. New York is 5-5 straight up in their last 10 games.

Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nNew York Mets DFS Spin\n\nMets second baseman Jeff McNeil got the big hit in his club's 3-2 win over the Yankees on Tuesday. In that contest, the left-handed hitter went 2 for 3 with a go-ahead homer, 2 RBIs, 2 runs scored, and a walk. McNeil has had a tough year overall (.225 batting average, .640 OPS) but he's been hitting better lately. In the past 15 days, Jeff McNeil is batting .281 with 3 homers, 10 RBIs, and a .990 OPS. McNeil's current hot streak means he could have some DFS value on Wednesday.\n\nNew York Yankees DFS Spin\n\nYankees second baseman Gleyber Torres drove in half of his team's runs in their 3-2 loss to the Mets on Tuesday. In that contest, the right-handed hitter from Venezuela went 1 for 3 with a homer, an RBI, a run scored, and a walk. For the season, Torres is batting .230 with 9 homers, 36 RBIs, and an OPS of .658. Gleyber Torres is hitting .290 with a .711 OPS over the past 15 days, making him an intriguing DFS option against Mets lefty Sean Manaea on Wednesday.\n\nMets vs. Yankees MLB Betting Trends\n\nThe Mets are 9-12 straight up in interleague games this season.\n\nThe Mets are 13-14 straight up as a road underdog this season.\n\nThe Yankees are 24-18 straight up after a loss this season.\n\nThe Yankees are 26-20 straight up as a home favorite this season.\n\nMets vs. Yankees Betting Prediction\n\nYankees ace Gerrit Cole is officially back. Cole didn't make his first start until June 19th of this season after dealing with an elbow injury. He then struggled when he did pitch, posting an ERA of 6.23 in 3 June starts. Cole has been much better since. In 3 July starts, Gerrit Cole has an ERA of 3.31, a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 23-4, and a WHIP of 1.35.

They are 3-0 against their crosstown rivals, including a two-game sweep at Citi Field last month.\n\nWith closer Edwin D\u00edaz unavailable, Jake Diekman worked a hitless ninth for his fourth save. After walking Juan Soto with one out, the veteran lefty froze Aaron Judge with a 96 mph fastball on the inside corner for a called third strike, then retired rookie Ben Rice on a grounder to end it.\n\nThe Mets had walked Judge his first four times up, once intentionally, but the Yankees couldn't capitalize.\n\nGleyber Torres homered early and Alex Verdugo had an RBI double for the scuffling Yankees. Rookie right-hander Luis Gil struck out six in five solid innings, yielding his only run when he plunked Francisco Lindor with a bases-loaded pitch in the fifth.\n\nThe score was 1-all when Pete Alonso greeted Michael Tonkin (3-4), cut twice by the Mets early this season, with a leadoff double in the sixth. One out later, McNeil launched his ninth home run of the year -- fourth in five games since the All-Star break -- to put the Mets ahead for good.\n\nAfter recovering from a fever last weekend, Quintana permitted one run and three hits over five innings in his first start since the break. He struck out six and walked five.\n\nIt was another feel-good win for the sleep-deprived Mets, who arrived home in the wee hours Tuesday morning after their flight from Miami was delayed.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: Rookie RHP Christian Scott was placed on the 15-day injured list with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. New York manager Carlos Mendoza said Scott will be examined by multiple doctors before it's determined how much time he could miss. ... RHP Sean Reid-Foley (shoulder impingement) faced hitters Monday and hopes to make a rehab appearance Thursday with High-A Brooklyn.\n\nYankees: OF Jasson Dom\u00ednguez (oblique strain) took live batting practice Monday at the team's complex in Florida and is headed to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to ramp up. He could be playing games within the week. \"So he's getting close,\" manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees ace Gerrit Cole (3-1, 4.60 ERA) starts Wednesday night against LHP Sean Manaea (6-4, 3.73) as the Mets try for a four-game sweep of the season series.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

Few were as bad as the Mets' Jeff McNeil.\n\nThe second baseman entered the season with a .289 career batting average, a batting title to his name and one of the heftier contracts at three years and over $40 million left on his contract. However, at the All-Star break he was in an epically bad place. He's played 88 games to a slash line of .216/.276/.314.\n\nMcNeil was an eyesore.\n\nIt's been an entirely different story since baseball resumed last Friday. In the Mets' five games, McNeil has hit four home runs and has eight RBIs.\n\nThe latest installment of the resurgence came Tuesday night on the big stage of the Subway Series when he hit a two-run home run into the Yankees bullpen in the sixth inning to send the Mets to a 3-2 victory before a sellout crowd of 47,453 at the Stadium.\n\nThe Mets have beaten the Yankees in all three of their meetings so far this season with the finale coming Wednesday. Yankees ace Gerrit Cole will be trying to avoid the Mets sweeping the season series.\n\nMcNeil's home run, a 393-footer off reliever Michael Tonkin, broke a 1-1 tie. And though they did give up a run, the Mets' bullpen - which has struggled for a month - held together to get the win. Mets relievers since June 23 had an MLB-worst 6.35 ERA entering play Tuesday.\n\nAdam Ottavino gave up a run on an Alex Verdugo double in the bottom of the sixth. But Alex Young, Dedniel Nunez, Phil Maton and Jake Diekman got the final 11 outs to preserve the win. Mets closer Edwin Diaz threw 28 pitches in Miami in Sunday's win.\n\nThe Mets had essentially removed Aaron Judge from the Yankees' offensive equation by walking him four times but Diekman had to face him with a runner on and one out in the ninth. He got Judge looking at strike three and then got Ben Rice to hit into a game-ending groundout.\n\nMets starter Jose Quintana (5-6) rebounded from a poor start against the Rockies in his final start before the break with five innings of one-run baseball. He gave up three hits and walked five - three times sidestepping Judge with free passes - and struck out six. The Yankees were 0-for-3 with runners in scoring position in those five innings.\n\nYankees starter Luis Gil didn't factor in the decision after pitching five innings of one-run ball. The rookie righthander was impressive in getting through the first four innings on 66 pitches with just one hit and one walk allowed. He allowed hits to the first three batters in the fifth and though he only allowed one run - on a bases-loaded hit-by-pitch - he threw 25 pitches in the inning and it ended his evening.\n\nGleyber Torres put the Yankees on the board first with a solo home run to right field in the second inning. It was his ninth homer and first since June 28. The second baseman had hits in four of his previous five games, but still brought just a .229 batting average into the game.\n\nThe Yankees had another excellent opportunity in the fourth when the first two hitters, Anthony Volpe and Torres, singled and walked respectively.\n\nVerdugo - who accounted for 40 of the 52 RBIs this season from the bottom third of Tuesday's batting order - made the odd choice to sacrifice the two runners into scoring position. Carlos Narvaez - making his first big league start - struck out and DJ LeMahieu lost an eighth pitch battle with Quintana for a flyout to end the inning.\n\nThe top of the fifth brought the Mets' turn for some poor judgement. Their inning started with a McNeil infield single and a Luis Torrens base hit to right field. Tyrone Taylor followed with a blast to right centerfield that Verdugo pursued but never caught up with. McNeil was still in tag-up distance when the ball came down on the warning track - a poor read - and the Mets didn't score on a drive that would have been a home run in 11 MLB ballparks, according to Statcast.\n\nThe Mets did, however, draw even at 1-1 when Gil hit Francisco Lindor on the left forearm with a 99 mph fastball to score McNeil.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news",

He has become a mainstay at Citi Field and can be seen traversing the stadium throughout the game, often attempting to invigorate the crowd.\n\nThe story of how Eddie originally became \"The Cowbell Man\" is one that revolves around music and a passion for the Mets, spanning back many years.\n\n\"My friends and I would go out to the stadium and play tunes. One time I came out with the cowbell,\" Boison said. \"Everyone was going 'Let's go Mets', so I did a rendition of that. People started to clap along with it and so it began.\"\n\nThe atmosphere at baseball stadiums is undoubtedly an important factor in any team's home-field advantage. This is largely created by the fans, an aspect that Eddie understands well, considering he has been a Met fan since 1963.\n\n\"I continue to do it for the fans,\" Boison said. \"I'm the type of person where I like to see the place become lively. When it's too quiet, me getting the fans motivated can help.\"\n\nBoison has an abundance of great memories of being a Mets fan. As many other long-time Mets fans would likely say, the championships in 1969 and 1986 rank near the top. For Boison, the game following 9/11 is a very special memory.\n\n\"One of my favorite memories is the 9/11 game when Mike Piazza hit a home run to beat Atlanta,\" Boison said. \"That is the biggest memory of all because it was about New York coming back.\"\n\nWhile the Mets have not had as much success over the past few years, Boison has still been going strong by attending nearly every home game. He will look to keep going even past this season.\n\n\"Hopefully I can do it for a couple more years,\" Boison said. \"I'm going to be 67 years old and have been doing this every day for 43 years. It really is a miracle.\"\n\nThe Mets have had a drastic turnaround this season and enter the second half in playoff position. The fans have seemingly been rejuvenated as the team has starkly turned their whole season around.\n\n\"I think pitching is the most important thing,\" Boison said. \"Right now we don't have a number one starter, but hopefully Senga comes back and can be that guy.\"\n\nKodai Senga, who went 12-7 last year with a 2.98 ERA, is expected to return shortly.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowbell_(instrument)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cowbell (instrument)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodai_Senga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kodai Senga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Piazza", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Piazza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3633-rotated-e1721573258320.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

After walking Juan Soto with one out, the veteran lefty froze Aaron Judge with a 96 mph fastball on the inside corner for a called third strike, then retired rookie Ben Rice on a game-ending grounder.\n\n\"He showed us a lot right there,\" McNeil said.\n\nThe Mets had walked Judge his first four times up, once intentionally, but the Yankees couldn't capitalize.\n\n\"I know how hot he is right now,\" Quintana said.\n\nOf the 19 pitches Judge saw, the only four in the strike zone were thrown by Diekman in the ninth.\n\n\"The last heater was spotted perfectly,\" Diekman said. \"I just challenged him and made quality pitches.\"\n\nJudge insisted he wasn't frustrated by the Mets' approach.\n\n\"I think they're just trying to be a little careful and you've just got to pass the baton to the next guy,\" he said. \"It's part of it. It's a team game. Even if I went 4 for 4 today, we still might not win. So it's just about, if I get a pitch to hit I've got to do some damage on it.\"\n\nGleyber Torres homered early and Alex Verdugo had an RBI double for the scuffling Yankees. Rookie right-hander Luis Gil struck out six in five solid innings, yielding his only run when he plunked Francisco Lindor with a bases-loaded pitch in the fifth.\n\nThe score was 1-all when Pete Alonso greeted Michael Tonkin (3-4), cut twice by the Mets early this season, with a leadoff double in the sixth. One out later, McNeil launched his ninth home run of the year -- fourth in five games since the All-Star break -- to put the Mets ahead for good.\n\n\"More confident. I feel like my swing is right where it needs to be,\" McNeil said. \"I feel a lot better. I feel like myself. ... I'm swinging the bat freely. I'm trying to get a good pitch I can drive.\"\n\nAfter recovering from a fever last weekend, Quintana permitted one run and three hits over five innings in his first start since the break. He struck out six and walked five.\n\nIt was another feel-good win for the sleep-deprived Mets, who arrived home in the wee hours Tuesday morning after their flight from Miami was delayed.\n\n\"We've had travel delays before,\" McNeil said. \"We were all prepared, and we showed it out there.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: Rookie RHP Christian Scott was placed on the 15-day injured list with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. Mendoza said Scott will be examined by multiple doctors before it's determined how much time he could miss. ... RHP Sean Reid-Foley (shoulder impingement) faced hitters Monday and hopes to make a rehab appearance Thursday with High-A Brooklyn.\n\nYankees: OF Jasson Dom\u00ednguez (oblique strain) took live batting practice Monday at the team's complex in Florida and is headed to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to ramp up. He could be playing games within the week. \"So he's getting close,\" manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees ace Gerrit Cole (3-1, 4.60 ERA) starts Wednesday night against LHP Sean Manaea (6-4, 3.73) as the Mets try to sweep the season series.\n\nCole was tagged by the Mets for six runs and seven hits -- including four homers -- over four innings June 25 at Citi Field in his second

Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports / Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New York Mets have stumbled a bit coming out of the All-Star break, losing two of their first three games to the lowly Miami Marlins over the weekend. On Monday they will try to split with the NL East's last-place team.\n\nThat being said, the expectation is that New York will be looking to add, not subtract to their roster with the trade deadline approaching in eight days.\n\nAccording to MLB insider Mark Feinsand of MLB.com, the Mets are \"firmly\" in the buyer category as things are supposed to heat up on the trade market this week with the July 30 date on the horizon.\n\n\"One front office executive believes the trade market will \"heat up big time this week, per multiple sources, the Rays are likely to both buy and sell, while the Mets, Padres and Twins are among the teams firmly in the \"buyer\" category. The deadline is 9 days away,\" as Feinsand reported on X on Sunday night.\n\nIt's no secret that the Mets are in desperate need of bullpen help. Beyond closer Edwin Diaz, Dedniel Nunez, new acquisition Phil Maton and long reliever Jose Butto, formerly a starter, there aren't many other options rookie manager Carlos Mendoza can count on.\n\nPresident of baseball operations David Stearns has been on the phone with other clubs since June attempting to upgrade his bullpen. Maton was the first move, which came on July 9, but there is still more work to be done.\n\nThe Mets could also look for another bat, as they haven't received enough production from their offense as of late, especially with pending free agent first baseman Pete Alonso struggling at the dish.\n\nThe Mets are 50-48 and tied for the third and final Wild Card spot. But they must bring in reinforcements. Ace Kodai Senga is likely to make his season debut on Friday, so the rotation is stout. However, bullpen is a glaring issue, and an additional bat is a possibility as well.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_ragazzo@si.com", "name": "Pat Ragazzo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_St._Lucie,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port St. Lucie, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port St. Lucie, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Maton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Maton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodai_Senga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kodai Senga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stearns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Stearns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_reliever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long reliever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3361,h_1890,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_mets/01j3dese3ntpddr2k0e0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 788, "textEnd": 795}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 1564, "textEnd": 1570}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

While the New York Mets have positioned themselves as buyers at the deadline, there's plenty of latitude within that label.\n\nSo with seven days to go, let's examine a few questions the Mets need to answer about themselves before embarking on external additions.\n\nFor weeks, the Mets offense has been one of the best in the league, propelled by Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo at the top of the order with Francisco Alvarez's return and Jos\u00e9 Iglesias' rejuvenation providing crucial assistance. That offense is bound to slow down at some point; how can the Mets best prepare themselves to supplement it then?\n\nAccording to ZiPS projection system over at FanGraphs, the three positions where the Mets figure to receive worse production moving forward are second base, third base and right field. One main reason for that possible regression? Of all the Mets' key contributors to this point in the season, Iglesias is the one out over his skis the most. Entering this season, he owned a career OPS+ of 88; this year it's 188. The club's joy around Iglesias' \"OMG\" song has belied how valuable he's been on the field, allowing the Mets to withstand Jeff McNeil's struggles and Starling Marte's recent injury.\n\nIf Iglesias were to fall back to his career norms, the Mets' offense would dip. New York would have to lean more heavily on a turnaround from McNeil, on a return from the injured list from Marte, on sustained production at third base from Mark Vientos and maybe on better numbers from Tyrone Taylor or DJ Stewart.\n\nAn ideal deadline addition, then, would cover the Mets for this possibility, bringing them a bench bat with experience at either the middle infield or the corner outfield. The Los Angeles Angels' Luis Rengifo is the best option, as he could play all over the place, though he'd represent a starting-level addition likely beyond the Mets' price point. Former Met Amed Rosario could work, as well.\n\nTwo weeks ago, when the Mets saw a 2-2 game in Pittsburgh unravel with Eric Orze and Adrian Houser on the mound, it was fair to wonder if they needed an entirely new bullpen. They'd lost Brooks Raley and Drew Smith, they'd watched Adam Ottavino and Jake Diekman struggle, they didn't know night to night what Edwin D\u00edaz could provide. Was there anyone Carlos Mendoza could trust?\n\nIn the fortnight since, that unit has stabilized to an extent. D\u00edaz had compiled nine consecutive scoreless outings before allowing a run Monday night. Phil Maton, acquired earlier this month from the Tampa Bay Rays, brings an experienced back-end right-hander. And maybe most importantly, Dedniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Jose Butt\u00f3 have looked like a legitimate set-up bridge.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez wasn't even invited to major-league spring training; he's been the Mets' best reliever this season by almost any measure. After excelling for multiple frames in mop-up spots, he's pitched and pitched well in bigger spots since the final week of June. For the season, N\u00fa\u00f1ez is striking out better than 35 percent of opposing hitters while walking fewer than 6 percent. In the last decade, D\u00edaz is the only Met to post a strikeout rate that good, and only D\u00edaz, Addison Reed and Seth Lugo have finished seasons with better strikeout-to-walk ratios.\n\nEffective as a starter this season, Butt\u00f3 has been electric as a reliever; he allowed his first run in the role Monday night, struck out more than a third of opposing hitters and owns a WHIP below 0.700 in that small sample.\n\nThe Mets still need help in that bullpen, and who knows how long both Butt\u00f3 and N\u00fa\u00f1ez will pitch quite like this? But perhaps New York only needs to bring in one or two arms rather than four or five.\n\nWith Kodai Senga returning this week, the Mets plan to go to a six-man rotation. Senga will join a rotation that already includes Jose Quintana, Luis Severino, Sean Manaea, David Peterson and Christian Scott. The Mets also have Butt\u00f3 and Houser in their bullpen, as well as Tylor Megill and Joey Lucchesi in Triple-A Syracuse.\n\nTheoretically, the Mets could capitalize on a seller's market and deal from their starting surplus, backfilling with their depth. Quintana, in particular, made sense to move as a veteran innings-eater set to become a free agent this winter. In the last several weeks, though, the dynamic has changed a bit: Quintana's been a significant part of the Mets' turnaround, Scott has struggled since his return to the majors, the club has committed to a six-man rotation with Senga's return, and Butt\u00f3 has emerged as a bullpen weapon. If New York were to deal Quintana (or Severino, who's in a similar contractual situation), it would be relying on Megill to take a regular turn in the rotation and leave few backup plans if and when an injury strikes.\n\nGiven how tight the wild-card standings are, such maneuvering could be too cute by half, especially if the return isn't that substantial. In our Trade Deadline Big Board, Severino ranked 13th among starting pitchers, and Quintana ranked 19th -- too low to make the top 50 targets. (In 2022, amid an overall better season, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Quintana was traded alongside reliever Chris Stratton to the St. Louis Cardinals for young starter Johan Oviedo.)\n\nThe Mets salvaged a split of their four-game series in Miami with Monday night's win. They've lost only one of their last 14 series, though a penchant for splitting series makes that less impressive in reality. The Mets are 51-48 and in the third wild-card spot in the National League.\n\nThe New York Yankees split their wraparound series with the Rays in the Bronx. They're 60-42, 1 1/2 games behind Baltimore in the AL East.\n\nAtlanta lost two of three at home over the weekend to the Cardinals. It still sits well behind the Phillies in the NL East but in a comfortable wild-card position in the National League. The Cincinnati Reds won the first of a three-game series at Truist Park Monday night.\n\nTriple-A: Syracuse at Buffalo (Toronto)\n\nDouble-A: Binghamton at Richmond (San Francisco)\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn v. Rome (Atlanta)\n\nLow-A: St. Lucie v. Palm Beach (St. Louis)\n\nSpeaking of out over his skis, I took a class on Goethe and Hegel during my first semester in college. I spent a lot of that semester citing Gob Bluth's \"I made a huge mistake,\" which you should know was a very contemporary reference at the time.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Mets' two best records in the second half of a season came in playoff years: 1969 and 1988. Their third-best came in a year in which they didn't make the postseason.

One through nine, Mets manager Carlos Mendoza can write a bona fide threat into every spot in the order, at least on days when Jose Iglesias is playing and not singing.\n\nThis differentiates them from the Yankees, who as well-known truth-teller Luis Severino memorably pointed out in some classic trash talking to his former Yankees teammates that they currently have \"only two good hitters.\"\n\n(Aside: I got a rare chance to edit rather than write, and I pointed out to the great sport Severino that while he was right about the other seven in the Yankees' order, it's fair to call Aaron Judge and Juan Soto \"all-time great\" and not just \"good.\" He agreed. \"Right, they're great,\" Sevy conceded to me.)\n\nPut-downs aside, the Mets are the deeper and better team right now. OMG are they ever! (hat tip to Candelita, Jose Iglesias' stage name)\n\nThanks to McNeil's heroics, the Mets beat the Yankees, 3-2, in a sold-out Subway Series game at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, going to 3-0 against their crosstown rival.\n\nFairly, in this one they barely survived quite a ninth-inning scare when previously struggling Jake Diekman got through the two superstars (closer Edwin Diaz was unavailable.) The valiant veteran walked Soto and struck out Judge after the Mets walked Judge his first four times up -- once intentionally and three times close to intentionally. (Mendoza served as Yankees bench coach six of Judge's seven-plus seasons, so he must understand to avoid him better than most others.)\n\nThough the Yankees remain 6\u2009\u00b9/\u2082 to the good over the Mets by record, the feeling is much more positive around the Mets now. Though their plane from Miami didn't touch down until 6 a.m. Tuesday, they played a generally alert brand of baseball, save for one bizarre baserunning play by McNeil two innings before he became a Subway Series hero.\n\nMcNeil's go-ahead home run -- he broke a 1-1 tie and now has six hits in 15 at-bats since the break -- came off ex-Met Michael Tonkin, who's been treated unkindly by the team from Queens counting two previous designations for assignment (a nice way of saying you're fired).\n\n\"I feel [McNeil' is] back to what he's capable of. But now he's driving the ball,\" Mendoza said.\n\nBoth local teams are in wild-card position and both could use some help. Yet, it is the slumping Yankees -- now 10-21 in their past 31 games -- who need significantly more trade deadline reinforcements.\n\nFor weeks, even months, no one saw this coming, not back when the Yankees were playing their way to a best-in-baseball 51-22 record and the Mets were digging themselves a deep hole 11 games below .500.\n\nWhile the Mets have played like a fringy playoff team over the past month, that's a lot better than the Yankees, who have plain stunk. Since their slide started more than a month ago, all but one team is outplaying them. Yes, of course that's the White Sox, who are challenging the historic 1962 Mets.\n\nWith a week to go before the deadline, it's clear which team has more holes to fill, and it's not the team from Queens. The really great thing about the Mets' current situation is that they already own the very two things most teams lack: rotation depth, and lineup depth.\n\nTheir lone pressing need remains obvious: They must bolster a bullpen that's mostly either moved to the season IL (Brooks Raley, Drew Smith), the temporarily IL (Reed Garrett, Sean Reid-Foley) or low-leverage situations (Adam Ottavino, Diekman). It was a stunner when Mendoza rolled the dice with Diekman (though he didn't say whether he closed his eyes for the Judge at-bat, which ended with a fastball for a called strike.)\n\nAs for the Yankees, well, they'll need of a deadline miracle. Or maybe two.\n\nThe rotation that was the best in baseball for two-plus months became the close to the worst for a month. The lineup that was the best in the game for those same two-plus months was close to the worst for that same month.\n\nFor weeks the Yankees were talking like they needed only a bullpen reinforcement or two. They still need some help there, especially of the swing-and-miss variety, true. And a starter wouldn't hurt, either. The Yankees' most glaring issue, however, is that two-superstar offense that's unlikely to work come the playoffs.\n\nI won't go over all the ugly numbers here, but suffice to say, it's hard to imagine a lineup composed of the game's two best hitters and seven guys who are struggling will go anywhere in October.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton doesn't look far off, and top hitting prospect Jasson Dominguez should become an option. But the two superstars need help now. A third basemen looks like a must, with Luis Rengifo, Jonathan India, Matt Chapman and Isaac Paredes among potential targets.\n\nThey'll need to do something about what's going on. As constituted, the Yankees simply are not good enough.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_heyman@nypost.com", "name": "Jon

The Yankees currently sit 1.5 games back of the Baltimore Orioles in the division after picking up their 60th win of the season (one of four teams to get there in 2024) on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Mets, on the other hand, hold the third and final wild card spot in the National League, but they're just half a game up on the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres.\n\nCan the Yankees get their revenge at home after falling behind 0-2 in the season series?\n\nHere's a look at the odds, starting pitchers and my prediction for tonight's matchup.\n\nPete Alonso: Mets first baseman Pete Alonso has been hot since the All-Star break, picking up four hits over his last three games while also scoring two runs. In his career against the Yanks, Alonso is hitting just .218, but eight of his 19 hits are home runs. Don't be shocked if he goes deep on Tuesday night.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nLuis Gil: After a rough stretch in late June into July, Luis Gil has returned to his early-season form in his last two outings. The rookie allowed just one run in each of his last two starts, striking out 16 players over 12.2 innings of work. While the Yankees did lose one of those games (they didn't score), Gil has kept them in nearly every game this season, leading to New York going 13-6 in his 19 starts.\n\nMets vs. Yankees Prediction and Pick\n\nThe key for the Yankees in this matchup will be Gil, as he's looked the part once again in his last two starts. After a five-start stretch from June 9 through July 2 where he posted a 8.85 ERA, Gil has rebounded nicely, giving up just two earned runs and nine hits over 12.2 innings of work.\n\nHe takes the mound against Mets lefty Jose Quintana, who was allowed three or fewer earned runs in 10 of his last 11 starts. Granted, he allowed five runs in his last outing, but this could be a good matchup for Quintana since the Yankees rank just 19th in MLB in OPS against lefties.\n\nBoth of these teams have hit the OVER in more than 55 percent of their games this season, but I'm going to go against the grain and take the UNDER.\n\nThe Mets are much better against lefties (top-five in OPS) than righties in 2024, and the Yankees offense only features two players (Aaron Judge and Juan Soto) who have been true threats over the last month.\n\nI don't see the Mets scoring a ton of runs again, even though they got to Gil in his start against them in late June.\n\nThere's some value in taking the UNDER at nearly plus money.\n\nPick: UNDER 8.5 (-102)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Mets vs. Yankees Prediction, Odds, Probable Pitchers for

Earlier this season, Manaea pitched five scoreless innings against the Yanks, but he also walked five batters. He'll need to have better control on Wednesday.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nAaron Judge: The New York Yankees superstar walked four times on Tuesday night, seeing very little to hit from starter Jose Quintana. Judge has 35 home runs already this season, and he's posted an MLB-best .439 on-base percentage. Will the Mets give him anything to hit tonight?\n\nMets vs. Yankees Prediction and Pick\n\nBack on June 25, Cole was rocked by the Mets, allowing seven hits and six runs across four innings of work.\n\nThat was just his second start back from an elbow injury, and the Yankees ace has looked much better as of late, allowing just two total runs across 12.0 innings of work in his last two outings.\n\nWhile Manaea has pitched well in 2024, he did struggle in his last outing, and he's failed to get through six innings in six of his last nine outings.\n\nThat's an issue since the Mets have a 4.14 bullpen ERA in the 2024 season, and they allowed a run in Tuesday's win that made things a little interesting heading into the final innings.\n\nI'm trusting Cole to stay hot in this game, and the Yankees are 4-2 in his six starts so far in 2024. The Yankees will salvage the final game of the Subway Series tonight.\n\nPick: Yankees Moneyline (-170)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Mets vs. Yankees Prediction, Odds, Probable Pitchers for Wednesday, July 24 (Do Yankees Finally Win?).", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_dewey@star-telegram.com", "name": "Peter Dewey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Probability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Probability", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ly2f8p/picture290371284/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/b5798b6a-dc86-464e-a920-555c61f580fe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 1361, "textEnd": 1368}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 2465, "textEnd": 2472}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He clapped emphatically after rounding second base, then excitedly gestured toward the stands as he continued his home-run trot.\n\nHe had good reason to celebrate.\n\nThe home run was McNeil's fourth in the five games since the All-Star break, continuing his stark resurgence after slumping to a .216 average, five homers, a .314 slugging percentage and a .591 OPS over 88 games in the season's first half.\n\nHis 2 for 3 performance Tuesday made him 6 for 15 (.400) since the All-Star break. McNeil hit two home runs in Friday's game in Miami and another in Monday's series finale against the Marlins.\n\nMcNeil is starting to resemble the version of himself that led all MLB hitters with a .326 average in 2022. The two-time All-Star hit .270 last year before a partial UCL tear ended his season in late September.\n\nAmid his struggles this season, McNeil was benched for a week in early June.\n\nTuesday's homer came an inninFg after McNeil failed to score from second base on what ended up being a 388-foot single by Tyrone Taylor.\n\nWith the Mets down 1-0, McNeil appeared to misread Taylor's drive to the wall in left-center and went back to second base to tag up, only to scurry to third after realizing Yankees left fielder Alex Verdugo had not caught it.\n\nA sprinting Luis Torrens, who began the play on first base, found himself on McNeil's heels and had to retreat to second, loading the bases with no outs.\n\nMcNeil ended up scoring when Yankees starter Luis Gil plunked Francisco Lindor two batters later, but that was all of the offense the Mets mustered in the inning.\n\nSituational hitting has haunted the Mets of late.\n\nThey entered Tuesday just 3 for- (.071) with runners in scoring position over their previous five games, stranding at least nine baserunners in each of them. The Mets went 2-3 during that stretch, despite facing the National League's worst two teams in the Rockies and Marlins.\n\nThe Mets were 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position Tuesday before McNeil's crucial blast, which scored Pete Alonso from third base.\n\nThey finished the game 2 for 10 with runners in scoring position and left eight on base. Tuesday marked the first game out of six in which the Mets had multiple hits with RISP.\n\nWith the win, the Mets improved to 30-15 in their last 45 games, a surge that started when they were a season-worst 11 games below .500.\n\nEntering Tuesday, the Mets boasted baseball's highest-scoring offense since May 29, despite their recent situational hitting woes. Their season-long average of .263 with runners in scoring position through Monday ranked sixth in the NL and 12th in the majors.\n\nThe Mets are now 3-0 against the Yankees, whom they swept in last month's two-game Subway Series at Citi Field.\n\nThey wrap up this week's two-game set in the Bronx -- and the season series between the interborough rivals -- on Wednesday night, with Sean Manaea scheduled to start for the Mets and Gerrit Cole set to pitch for the Yankees.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Here are the numbers ahead of Subway Series", "body": "Yankees writer Pete Caldera and Mets writer Andrew Tredinnick break down the state of the two teams and biggest hurdles before their next meeting.\n\nOn June 11, the Yankees and Mets were headed in completely different directions.\n\nThe Bronx Bombers had just picked a series win and an eventual four-game sweep over the Royals to improve to 48-21 on the season and continued their stranglehold on the AL East division.\n\nFor the Mets, they dropped a series opener versus the Marlins at Citi Field to move to nine games under .500 with a record of 28-37 with the playoffs not even in sight at the time.\n\nAnd now, the roles are completely reversed.\n\nThe Yankees are a woeful 12-21 in that span, losing seven of their next nine series heading into the All-Star Break and split a four-game homestand versus the Rays to start the second half as they now look up at the Orioles for AL East Division lead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mets are one of the hottest teams in MLB, winners of 23 of their last 34 games and have soared all the way up to the third and final wild card spot in the National League playoff picture.\n\nWith the regular season more than halfway over and the final rendition of this year's Subway Series beginning on Tuesday night, there's no better time to reflect on my preview for both teams' win totals leading up to the regular season and how to bet their win totals moving forward.\n\nWin totals prior to 2024 regular season: Yankees 93.5 wins, Mets 82.5 wins\n\nRoughly a month out from the beginning of the 2024 season, the Yankees had one of the highest projected win totals in baseball, tying the Astros with an American League best 93.5 win total for the year.\n\nEven though many (including yours truly) thought the Bronx Bombers would get off to a good start, I'm not sure how many would've predicted the franchise getting off to a historic start where they won 45 of their first 64 games and 16 of 18 series to begin their 2024 campaign.\n\nOn the other side, the Mets were floating around the .500 mark until May 10 when they would go on to lose 15 of their next 19 games to end the month.\n\nAt that time, the price for the Yankees and Mets couldn't be further from one another, with the Bronx Bombers hovering around a win total around the century mark while the Mets were in the low-to-mid 70s given their poor performance heading into June.\n\nYankees, Mets win totals now: Yankees 96.5 wins, Mets 82.5 wins\n\nFlash forward to present day and their win totals have shifted dramatically. The Yankees line has moved down to 96.5 wins while the Mets are back to their preseason number of 82.5 victories.\n\nIn order for the Bronx Bombers to eclipse this total, they'd have to finish the regular season with a record of 37-23. With the way they've been playing right now, that seems a bit out of reach, especially with a tough road trip against the Red Sox (lost both series so far in 2024) and Phillies on deck after the two-game Subway Series matchup.\n\nWith a xxxx win over the Marlins on Monday night, the Mets have a much easier path to their current win total, needing to go only 32-31 to get to the 83-win mark this season. Even still, it won't be easy for the Mets, who have a 10-game road trip coming up to begin August which is followed by facing AL East opponents in the Orioles and Red Sox. They finish out the year with 13 of their final 16 contests in division, with seven games versus the MLB's best Phillies, and conclude the regular season on the road against the Braves and NL Central leading Brewers.\n\nThe Yankees and Mets going over or under on their win totals could ultimately come down to the final series or two. The Bronx Bombers will undoubtedly be getting back multiple reinforcements (Anthony Rizzo, Giancarlo Stanton, Clarke Schmidt, Jaason Dominguez and others) down the stretch at various points and also face the Athletics and Pirates with the Orioles sandwiched in between to wrap up the year.\n\nFor the Mets, they won't have to wait nearly as long as ace Kodai Senga will make his 2024 debut at Citi Field on Friday versus the Braves.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I expect both the Yankees and Mets will still finish below these current win total projections, with the Yankees hovering around 92-95 victories at season's end and the Mets unable to make it to the .500 mark, missing the postseason for a second consecutive season but slightly improve from their 75-win campaign in 2023.\n\nOn FanDuel Sportsbook in New Jersey, the Yankees win total of 96.5 is juiced to the under at -132 (Bet $132 to win $100) with the over at nearly even money with +102 odds (Bet $100 to win $102).

The 31-year-old isn't having a great season by any means, but posted a 0.75 ERA in his final 12 innings with Tampa, and has allowed just one run across three innings (four appearances) as a Met.\n\nWhile the move for Maton was a start, there are still additional trades to be made in order to improve their struggling bullpen. And as president of baseball operations David Stearns revealed following this deal, he has been speaking with a number of clubs about relief help since June.\n\nSo, here are some teams that feel like ideal trade partners for the Mets ahead of the deadline, as they carry some intriguing bullpen arms.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds, who have been engaged with the cross-town rival New York Yankees about their relievers, as Sports Illustrated reported on July 11, are a match because they have a number of relief pitchers whose deals expire after the season. Righty duo Buck Farmer (2.80 ERA in 45 innings) and Lucas Sims (3.38 ERA in 32 innings) would certainly fit with the Mets. Farmer also provides length out of the 'pen, as does versatile righty Nick Martinez. Although Martinez has a more expensive deal, making $14 million in 2024 along with a player option of $12 million next season, he would give the Mets some starting pitching depth in addition to boosting their bullpen.\n\nThe Reds have scouted the Yankees' big-league team given the fact that they were just four-games behind the Mets for the final NL Wild Card spot entering play on Sunday. They're in need of starting pitching, and the Mets have the ammo to give it to them.\n\nThe Marlins, who are an NL East rival of course, could be a trade partner after the Mets sent closer David Robertson to Miami in exchange for two young prospects in Marco Vargas and Ronald Hernandez at last year's deadline. Left-handed closer Tanner Scott is a highly sought after rental that New York may try to land. But there is hefty competition for his services.\n\nSpeaking of Robertson, maybe New York makes a run at reuniting with the 39-year-old, who has a 2.88 ERA, a 0.93 WHIP and 61 strikeouts with the Texas Rangers in 40.2 innings this season. The Rangers have not yet indicated whether they're going to sell or not, but they're six games under .500 and 7.5 games back of the third AL Wild Card spot. Robertson has a mutual option for 2025, so he could once again hit the open market. Texas could also deal All-Star closer Kirby Yates, who will be a free agent after the season ends.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox have been fielding many calls about superstar lefty starter Garrett Crochet, outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and righty reliever Michael Kopech, who they're trying to package together in a blockbuster deal. The Los Angeles Dodgers are very involved on this trio, and have a deep farm system. But if they can't get a bigger trade done, the Mets could potentially swoop in and try to acquire Kopech or even versatile bounce-back hurler Erick Fedde.\n\nLast but not least, the Washington Nationals, another NL East rival, could be selling off veteran relievers Kyle Finnegan and Dylan Floro. Finnegan, their All-Star closer, has another year of control, so no guarantee that he goes. However, Floro will be a free agent after 2024, and the righty is an attractive trade piece. Corner outfielder Jesse Winker is an additional possible target for the Mets.\n\nThis isn't a year, where the Mets are going to be emptying their farm system. That being said, they're deep on starting pitching with a focus on adding bullpen, so it's possible that they ship out a veteran starter for relief help, as both buyers and sellers.", "source":

Lindor has 21 homers and 60 RBIs.\n\nMark Vientos went deep against Tim Hill in a five-run eighth as the Yankees allowed four or more homers for the third time in five games.\n\nThe Mets finished 4-0 against the Yankees this year, matching their sweep in 2013, and outscored them 36-14. The Mets improved to 29-13 after a 24-35 start.\n\nThe Yankees (60-44) are 10-22 following a 50-22 start and 1-8-2 in their last 11 series after opening 17-3-2.

The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner has given up seven home runs with an 11.17 ERA in a pair of starts against the Mets and two homers with a 3.20 ERA in his other five outings.\n\nTaylor hit a tying homer in the third, Alonso a two-run shot in the fourth and Lindor a two-run drive in the fifth among his three hits.\n\nTaylor chased Cole with his third hit, an RBI single in the sixth that caused fans to boo the Yankees ace when he walked to the dugout. Taylor also made a sprawling backhand catch in center that robbed Alex Verdugo of a hit leading off the bottom half.\n\nWith the Mets ahead 5-2, Adam Ottavino (2-2) got Anthony Volpe to ground into an inning-ending forceout with the bases loaded in the fifth.\n\nManaea gave up two runs, three hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings.\n\nThe season-high crowd of 48,760 was the Yankees' 14th sellout, one shy of their 2023 total.\n\nTorres, restored to the top of the batting order for the first time since April 9, hit his first career leadoff homer.\n\nSoto made a leaping catch to rob Jeff McNeil at the top of the right-field wall for the final out of the second. McNeil had homered in his previous two games, including a tiebreaking, two-run drive that lifted the Mets to a 3-2 win Tuesday.\n\nYankees pitching coach Matt Blake left before the start of the game when his wife went into labor for the delivery of their first child.\n\nThe Mets agreed to a minor league contract with Oklahoma State outfielder Carson Benge, the 19th overall pick in the amateur draft.\n\nMets: Rookie RHP Christian Scott won't throw for two weeks but is expected to pitch again this season after an MRI of his ailing right elbow did not show a severe injury. ...

He clapped emphatically after rounding second base, then excitedly gestured toward the stands as he continued his home-run trot.\n\nHe had good reason to celebrate.\n\nThe home run was McNeil's fourth in the five games since the All-Star break, continuing his stark resurgence after slumping to a .216 average, five homers, a .314 slugging percentage and a .591 OPS over 88 games in the season's first half.\n\nHis 2-for-3 performance Tuesday made him 6-for-15 (.400) since the All-Star break. McNeil hit two home runs in Friday's game in Miami and another in Monday's series finale against the Marlins.\n\nMcNeil is starting to resemble the version of himself that led all MLB hitters with a .326 average in 2022. The two-time All-Star hit .270 last year before a partial UCL tear ended his season in late September.\n\nAmid his struggles this season, McNeil was benched for a week in early June.\n\nTuesday's homer came an inninFg after McNeil failed to score from second base on what ended up being a 388-foot single by Tyrone Taylor.\n\nWith the Mets down 1-0, McNeil appeared to misread Taylor's drive to the wall in left-center and went back to second base to tag up, only to scurry to third after realizing Yankees left fielder Alex Verdugo had not caught it.\n\nA sprinting Luis Torrens, who began the play on first base, found himself on McNeil's heels and had to retreat to second, loading the bases with no outs.\n\nMcNeil ended up scoring when Yankees starter Luis Gil plunked Francisco Lindor two batters later, but that was all of the offense the Mets mustered in the inning.\n\nSituational hitting has haunted the Mets of late.\n\nThey entered Tuesday just 3-for-42 (.071) with runners in scoring position over their previous five games, stranding at least nine baserunners in each of them. The Mets went 2-3 during that stretch, despite facing the National League's worst two teams in the Rockies and Marlins.\n\nThe Mets were 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position Tuesday before McNeil's crucial blast, which scored Pete Alonso from third base.\n\nThey finished the game 2-for-10 with runners in scoring position and left eight on base. Tuesday marked the first game out of six in which the Mets had multiple hits with RISP.\n\nWith the win, the Mets improved to 30-15 in their last 45 games, a surge that started when they were a season-worst 11 games below .500.\n\nEntering Tuesday, the Mets boasted baseball's highest-scoring offense since May 29, despite their recent situational hitting woes. Their season-long average of .263 with runners in scoring position through Monday ranked sixth in the NL and 12th in the majors.\n\nThe Mets are now 3-0 against the Yankees, whom they swept in last month's two-game Subway Series at Citi Field.\n\nThey wrap up this week's two-game set in the Bronx -- and the season series between the interborough rivals -- on Wednesday night, with Sean Manaea scheduled to start for the Mets and Gerrit Cole set to pitch for the Yankees.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Our MLB odds series has our Mets-Yankees prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nThe Mets make the trip across New York to face the Yankees! These are two teams that have surprised this season. The Yankees are one of the best teams in the MLB. The Mets were supposed to be rebuilding, but they have been playing much better than expected this year. Our MLB odds series has our Mets-Yankees prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched five innings and gave up five runs on eight hits with one walk and one strikeout in a Mets loss.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up one run on six hits with one walk and eight strikeouts in a Yankees win.\n\nThe Mets had a complete makeover from last year to this year. This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for them, but they are 51-48 this season and have won two out of their last three games. Their bats have jumped above average after struggling earlier this season, while their pitching has still struggled. Pete Alonso, Francisco Lindor, Starling Marte, and Brandon Nimmo have been solid behind the plate despite their struggles on offense. Luis Severino, Sean Manaea, and David Peterson have been solid despite the staff struggling. The Mets have been a big surprise and are in the wildcard hunt.\n\nThe Mets are starting Sean Manaea on the mound and he has a 6-4 record, a 3.73 ERA, and a 1.24 WHIP. Manaea has allowed 46 runs on 85 hits with 41 walks and 97 strikeouts through 101.1 innings. In the 19 games he has started this season, the Mets are 12-7. Manaea has been playing well in his own right and has been a bright spot for the Mets this year on the mound. However, he has a huge challenge in this game against the Yankees behind the plate and how good their offense has been playing all year.\n\nThe Mets have gotten red-hot recently behind the plate and are 11th in the MLB. They have a .250 batting average after having a .238 batting average last season. Pete Alonso, Brandon Nimmo, and Francisco Lindor lead the way in most batting categories this season. Lindor leads in batting average at .256, is tied for the lead in home runs with Alonso at 19, and in total hits at 102. Finally, Nimmo leads in RBI at 63 and in OBP at .358. The Mets have been red-hot and get a favorable matchup against Gerrit Cole for the Yankees because he has been rusty since coming back from an injury.\n\nWhy The Yankees Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Yankees have been one of the best teams in the MLB and they have a 60-42 record. Their bats and pitching have been great this whole season. Their bats have fallen just outside the top 10 in the MLB, while their pitching is still strong and ranks in the top five. Juan Soto is a huge difference maker and an MVP-caliber player who was added to go with Anthony Rizzo, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo, and Anthony Volpe behind the plate. Nestor Cortes, Marcus Stroman, Clarke Schmidt, and Luis Gil have all been at varying levels of at least good if not great on the mound in New York.\n\nThe Yankees are starting Gerrit Cole on the mound where he has a 3-1 record, a 4.60 ERA, and a 1.40 WHIP. Cortes has allowed 15 runs on 31 hits with 10 walks and 34 strikeouts through 29.1 innings. He has started in six games and the Yankees have gone 4-2 in those games. Cole has been rusty since coming back from injury after winning the Cy Young last season. He also gets a huge challenge against a Mets offense that has been red-hot in their own right recently.\n\nThe biggest key to the Yankees and their success is their offense. They are ranked 12th in the MLB currently in team batting average at .248 which is a massive improvement after struggling to .227 last season. Aaron Judge and Juan Soto lead in almost every batting category. Judge leads in home runs at 35, in RBI at 89, and in OBP at .435. Finally, Soto leads in batting average at .311 and total hits at 112. This offense has cooled off a bit, and they get a difficult matchup against Sean Manaea on the mound for the Mets. This offense has been great, but Bradley has been having a great year in his own right.\n\nFinal Mets-Yankees Prediction & Pick\n\nBaseball is better with competitive teams in New York and we get that with both teams this season. The Mets have the better offense and the pitching advantage in this game. The offensive difference is marginal, but Manaea is a better option at pitcher than Cole is. Expect the Mets to keep this close and win at Yankee Stadium in the metro series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Martinez Reveals What Can Be 'Demoralizing' About Trade Deadline", "body": "Manager Carlos Mendoza and the New York Mets are currently looking for ways to stay afloat in a heated playoff race that looks poised to come down to the wire as the season crosses its midway point. The Mets struggled mightily coming out of the gates this year, falling behind the eight ball quickly in the NL East, but Mendoza's squad had shown resiliency in clawing their way back to above the .500 mark and giving themselves a potential chance at a wild card berth later on this season.\n\nOf course, at this time of year, the story that typically dominates the headlines revolves around the MLB trade deadline, which is set to expire on July 30, and one person who may or may not be subtly putting pressure on his team to make some moves is none other than Mets veteran and former All Star JD Martinez, who recently spoke on his experiences with the 2021 Boston Red Sox and how frustrating that season was at the deadline.\n\n\"We got to the deadline and didn't get anybody,\" said Martinez about those Red Sox, via Newsday. \"We needed help and we had to grind all the way back. Fortunately, we snuck into the wild card, but we saw teams all around us get better and we didn't. ...\n\n\"I remember how demoralizing it was for the team, doing the opposite thing. Obviously, there's a price and a cost. That has to be reasonable. But it's definitely big. I know teams feel it, clubhouses feel it.\"\n\nThe Mets haven't made any significant moves yet but there is still time to get something done if they truly feel they have a chance to compete.\n\nHowever, recently, MLB insider Bob Nightengale of USA Today noted that \"GMs are more reluctant than ever to give up prized prospects for a short-term fix for the pennant race,\" meaning that for a team like the Mets that is only a couple of games above the .500 mark, dumping valuable young assets for a long shot at contention may not be worth the risk.\n\nIt's been a steady decline for the Mets since about midway through the 2022 season, when they were coasting toward an NL East title but then relinquished that to the Atlanta Braves, lost in the Wild Card round to the San Diego Padres, and then missed the playoffs altogether in 2024.\n\nIn any case, time is running out for New York to make a decision.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/J.D.-Martinez-reveals-what-can-be-demoralizing-about-trade-deadline.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 639, "textEnd": 646}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The Yanks also were blown out 12-2 in Queens in June.\n\nWednesday's loss was the Yanks' ugliest of the season and a continuation of a really bad stretch that now has them sitting on 22 losses in their last 32 games.\n\nThe Yankees should feel really lucky that they're only 1 \u00bd games out of first place in the AL East because the Orioles have been losing games in bunches, too.\n\nThe Yankees' latest bad night was a complete meltdown that included ace Gerrit Cole (3-2) being hammered by the Mets for the second time this season.\n\nThis time, Cole was so bad allowing six runs over 5 2/3 innings, five of them coming on three homers, that was booed when knocked out in the sixth with the Mets ahead 6-2.\n\nOn June 25 at Citi Field, the righty was bombed in season debut, allowing six runs in four innings in a 9-7 Yankees loss.\n\nThere were many other culprits in Wednesday's loss. Juan Soto homered and might have prevented one with a leaping catch at the top of the right-field wall, but the Yankees were 1-for-10 hitting with runners in scoring position and stranded 11.\n\nThe Yankees also didn't hit in the clutch in Tuesday night's 3-2 loss, going 1-for-9 in RISP situations with 11 more LOBs.\n\nThere was more ugliness. Third baseman Oswaldo Cabrera gifted the Mets a run making a bad throw to the plate after fielding a grounder and Aaron Judge misplayed a flyball to center that went over his head during the Mets' sixth-run eighth.\n\nWith most of the sellout crowd gone, a bunch of Mets fans who stuck around chanted \"Let's Go Mets\" in delight in the ninth inning while reliever Adrian Houser was putting away the Yankees.\n\nNOTABLE\n\n-- Pitching coach Matt Blake left the ballpark before ther start of the game to be with his wive, who was in labor. Bullpen coach Mike Harkey made a mound visit in the sixth before Cole was knocked out.\n\n-- Mets No. 9 hitter Tyrone Taylor was 3-for-3 facing Cole with a third-inning homer that tied the game 1-1, a leadoff single in the fifth that was followed by Francisco Lindor's two-run homer and a two-out RBI single in the sixth that forced a pitching change.\n\n-- The Yankees had only six hits, two apiece by Gleyber Torres and Soto.\n\n-- Torres hit leadoff and started the Yankees' first with a homer off Mets lefty Sean Manaea, his second in two nights.\n\nFriday: Yankees at Red Sox, 7:10 p.m., YES.

He consistently sports blue-and-orange attire with unique patches sewed on that generally relate to the team.\n\nPhil first became a big Mets fan during the Mike Piazza era. His mother, who is a two-time breast cancer survivor, would consistently watch Mets games with her caretaker/best friend. This would inspire Phil to start watching Mets games. In 2018, Phil and his then-girlfriend, now wife, came up with a special idea for an outfit that would stand out.\n\nPhil takes a jacket and sews patches onto them to create a Mets-themed fit, with the help of his wife and mother-in-law throughout the creative process. He has about 60 to 70 patches on each jacket, though he likes to say 69 specifically as a nod to the 1969 Miracle Mets.\n\n\"I didn't just want to have a jersey, I wanted to do something different,\" Phil said. \"My initial jersey was an orange blazer that modeled the old Shea Stadium ushers.\"\n\nEvery Saturday that the Mets play at home, Phil attends the game and sits in section 412. In his \"Saturday section\", he forms friendships as he and fellow Mets fans bond over their support for the team.\n\n\"Meeting so many new people is my favorite part of it all. I'm at a point where I call these people who I see in my section my legitimate friends,\" Phil said. \"The movie Fever Pitch really describes my life and how awesome it has become.\"\n\nThis season, \"Patchman Phil\" debuted a blue jacket with short sleeves. With large \"Patchman\" letters written on the back, it certainly helps Phil stand out in a crowd.\n\nAs distinguished from other sports, every baseball stadium carries different dimensions. With different food, atmospheres and more, visiting respective stadiums can be a very amusing experience for any fan.\n\n\"My favorite activity is traveling to different stadiums,\" Phil said. \"I've been to PNC Park and Wrigley Field and have had the chance to meet a variety of people. My wife and I do trips like that.\"\n\nThis year, as a unique two-game series, the Mets traveled to London to play against the rival Philadelphia Phillies on June 8-9. Just because the team was playing internationally didn't mean that \"Patchman Phil\" wouldn't be in attendance.\n\n\"Most recently, I went to London with my dad to see the Mets play the Phillies,\" Phil said. \"The UK people loved my jacket so it was very cool to be 'Patchman' abroad.\"\n\nThe Mets are seemingly atop the charts of baseball teams with unique superfans. \"Jaymaccustoms\", \"Eddie the Cowbell Man\", \"Pinman\" and \"Patchman\" are just a few of these fans who showcase their spirit in niche ways.\n\n\"Mets fans are different from other fans. The Yankees are more serious and are more about business.\" Phil said. \"I find the Mets are more family-orientated which opens things up for more playfulness, wildness and fun atmospheres. The World Series drought plays a role for the Mets fans too.\"\n\nSocial media has revolutionized the way that fans can interact with one another and their favorite teams. The Mets have over one million followers on Instagram. \"Patchman Phil\" recognizes the importance of adjusting to the social media landscape.\n\n\"I want to get more into the social media aspect of connecting with fans,\" Phil said. \"People will message me when I'm at a game and ask to meet up. I definitely think that grows the 'Patchman'.\"\n\n\"Patchman Phil\" has also had ideas about doing a social media series about his myriad patches' history. He has ones from the '60s and '70s, including the original Mr. Met patch and the original Mets kid club patch.\n\n\"One of my favorite patches is the baby Mets patch as I am now a dad,\" Phil said. \"I also appreciate the scout day patch as I'm an Eagle scout and remember going to Shea Stadium as a kid.\"", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Janitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Piazza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Piazza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shea Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Met", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mr. Met"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2917DF7F-CFB4-40BF-84D9-A8EAFD90057D-e1721663992985.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "dateEnd": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 2153, "textEnd": 2161}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The guys that I really care about are the team, and they knew I was joking around. Sometimes somebody is going to be pissed, but in the end, I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.\"\n\nBut Yankees star Juan Soto -- who's in his first season with the team and did not play with the current Mets pitcher -- responded to Severino's jab at the Yankees.\n\n\"It is what it is. They can think whatever they want,\" Soto told ESPN on Tuesday.\n\nSeverino's joke is based on how the Yankees' lineup has been inordinately reliant on 2022 AL MVP Aaron Judge and Soto, who have combined for 60 of the team's 146 home runs this season. The duo of 2024 All-Star starters also make up the only two active everyday players on the Yankees who boast an OPS north of .750, which is considered roughly average.\n\nSoto, who appeared in his fourth MLB All-Star Game last week, entered the Yankees' Tuesday night game against the Mets having totaled 25 home runs and 71 RBIs, while sporting a .311/.435/.594 slash line.\n\nIn what's his first season with the Mets, Severino has posted a 3.58 ERA, 1.18 WHIP and 88 strikeouts across 115.2 innings (19 starts). Severino posted a 6.65 ERA in his final season with the Yankees (2023) and hasn't pitched a full season since 2018 due to elbow and shoulder injuries, among others.\n\nThe Yankees and Mets faced off earlier this season in Queens, with the Mets sweeping the two-game set and out-scoring the Yankees 21-9. They square off for the final time this week in the Bronx, but Severino isn't slated to start either game of the two-game slate.\n\nThe two teams are going in opposite directions. While the Yankees are 60-42 -- which is good for the first AL wild-card seed and 1.5 games behind the Baltimore Orioles for first place in the AL East -- they've lost 20 of their last 30 games. On the other hand, while the Mets are just 51-48 -- good for the third NL wild-card seed and third in the NL East -- they've won 27 of their last 40. It remains to be seen just what exactly the resurgent Mets will do before the the MLB trade deadline next week, but the team is reportedly unlikely to trade All-Star first baseman Pete Alonso, who will be a free agent next winter.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1408/814/soto.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday night, the Pinstripes turn to reigning AL Cy Young-winner Gerrit Cole to try to stop the bleeding.\n\nThe Mets vs Yankees odds list the home team as sizable favorites on Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx (7:10 pm ET).\n\nNY Mets vs NY Yankees Odds\n\nThe Yankees are -166 to even the series on Wednesday night and +130 on the runline to win by multiple runs. The Mets come back as +140 underdogs to win straight-up and -155 to keep the score within a run.\n\nThe Yankees managed a split with the Rays in their first series after the All-Star break but entered the hiatus going 8-17 in their last 25 games. That tailspin dropped New York behind Baltimore in the AL East standings, where the Yankees are currently 1.5 games in arrears.\n\nThe MLB division odds list New York as the +105 second-favorite in the AL East behind the Orioles.\n\nThe Mets, on the other hand, entered the break winning eight of ten and are now 3-2 since play resumed on Friday. They remain 11.5 games back of the league-leading Phillies in the NL East but have a half-game lead on the final Wild Card spot in the National League.\n\nAfter an elbow injury kept him out until mid-June, Cole started the 2024 campaign on a relatively rough note, posting a 6.75 ERA through his first four starts and making it out of the fifth inning just once.\n\nBut his last two starts before the All-Star break were much more Cole-esque. The reigning Cy Young-winner allowed just two runs over 12.0 innings with more strikeouts (15) than hits and walks (11+2).\n\nManager Aaron Boone allowed Cole to go over 90 pitches in both starts for the first time in his abbreviated season. Both starts ended in Yankees victories: 4-1 over Baltimore on July 12 and 6-1 over Tampa on July 19.\n\nCole's second start this season was against the Mets, and he was tagged for six earned runs on seven hits (four home runs) in just 4.0 innings during a 9-7 loss on June 25.\n\nHe still has excellent numbers against the Mets hitters, overall, though. In 149 total ABs, they are slashing just .201/.287/.436 against Cole.\n\nManaea had has an up-and-down season with, on the whole, more good than bad, but he was roughed up in his final start before the break, allowing five runs on eight hits and a walk over 5.0 innings in a 6-4 loss at light-hitting Miami.\n\nPrior, he had piled up 20 innings in his last three starts (at least 6.0 in each) allowing just four runs total on 12 hits and six walks with 20 Ks.\n\nIn his first start against the Yankees this year, Manaea pitched 5.0 shutout innings, allowing five hits and two walks with three Ks in a 12-2 Mets victory.\n\nManaea's career numbers against current Yankee hitters are not pretty, however. They have a .281 average and .853 OPS in 57 at-bats. Aaron Judge is 6-for-13 with two homers.\n\nNY Mets vs NY Yankees Prediction for July 24\n\nCole's last two starts before the All-Star break give me confidence we're going to see the reigning AL Cy Young-winner on Wednesday, and not the rehabbing imposter who took his place in June.\n\nHis stamina is back and it's showed on his fastball velocity, which was topping out at about 92 mph after the first inning when he was tagged for four homers the first time he faced the Mets this season.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"},

It's yet another edition of the Subway Series, which next year will feature six games instead of this year's total of four.\n\nBack in June, these teams played two games in Queens, both of which the Mets won as they scored nineteen runs across the pair of games to the Yankees' nine. The Yankees are also coming off a split of a four-game series against a team from Florida, as they and the Rays each won twice in their series at Yankee Stadium coming out of the All-Star break.\n\nBefore the break, though, the Yankees were really struggling. Since a win over the Red Sox on June 14 that left them with a 50-22 record and 3.5 games up on the Orioles for first place in the American League East, the team has gone 10-20 over its last thirty games, including the recent series against the Rays. The Orioles haven't been red hot, either, but they currently sit 1.5 games ahead of the Yankees for first place in the division.\n\nThere was a playful -- but seemingly accurate -- exchange between Luis Severino and his former Yankees teammates coming out of the break, as the pitcher joked that he wouldn't have been afraid to face them since the team only has two good hitters right now. Since June 15, the first game of their bad stretch, Yankees hitters have a 109 wRC+ that ranks 10th in baseball, which isn't bad. But as excellent as Aaron Judge (210 wRC+) and Juan Soto (195 wRC+) have been over that span, there are plenty of holes in this version of the Yankees' lineup.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton is still on the injured list, and to their credit, both Austin Wells (156 wRC+) and Trent Grisham (118 wRC+) have performed admirably at the plate, albeit in limited roles with far fewer plate appearances than the Yankees' big duo.\n\nThe Mets got away with it the last time they saw the Yankees, but they should give much stronger consideration to pitching around or flat out intentionally walking at least Judge in any situation where his ability to hit a home run might have a significant impact on the game. If the Mets were to have a big lead late in either of these games, walking both Soto and Judge intentionally -- back-to-back -- could even be a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, the Mets' lineup has been firing on all cylinders over that same span of time. Nine Mets hitters have hit above league average by wRC+ since the middle of June, and seven of those nine have been considerably above the league average mark of 100.\n\nOnly a few active hitters on the roster have struggled over that span: Jeff McNeil, DJ Stewart, Tyrone Taylor, and Ben Gamel. And it helps that McNeil has come out of the break looking fantastic, as he's hit .333/.308/1.083 with three home runs and a 263 wRC+ in the first four games of the second half. It's the tiniest of samples, but it's the best he's looked at the plate all season.\n\nAs for the pitching side of things, the Yankees have had a much better staff overall over the course of the 2024 season, as they rank fourth in baseball with a 3.58 ERA. The Mets' 4.21 ERA ranks 21st. But things have looked much worse for Yankees pitchers since the middle of June, as they have a 5.22 ERA that is the third-worst mark in baseball over that span. The Mets have held relatively steady, as their 4.32 ERA since then ranks 17th.\n\nThe Yankees' bullpen has slipped a bit during that stretch, sitting a little below the middle of the pack in the sport after getting off to an exceptional start this year. It's still been a much, much better bullpen than what the Mets have right now, but that is a low bar to clear. Even as the Mets have played incredibly well, their relievers have an awful 5.36 ERA since June 15.\n\nThere's no reason that either of these teams can't win one or both games, which should make for a competitive short series. And it's always interesting to see what fly balls Yankee Stadium III will turn into home runs -- many of which wouldn't even come close to going over the fence if they were hit in Queens.\n\nQuintana (2024): 102.1 IP, 79 K, 34 BB, 17 HR, 4.13 ERA, 4.99 FIP, 106 ERA-\n\nFollowing his worst start of the season against the Rays in early May, Quintana settled in to a relatively nice groove over the course of his next eleven starts. Over that span, he had a 3.13 ERA -- with a 5.02 FIP that made the ERA look unsustainable -- before his most recent start in the Mets' final game before the All-Star break. Despite notching eight strikeouts against the Rockies that day, he gave up five earned runs in 5.2 innings of work. As depleted as the Yankees' lineup is outside of the big two right now, Quintana pitching in this ballpark could make for a rough series opener.\n\nGil (2024): 102.1 IP, 118 K, 49 BB, 9 HR, 3.17 ERA, 3.60 FIP, 80 ERA-\n\nAfter starting the season very well, Gil hit a really rough patch in late June and early July, and the Mets were one of three teams during that span to hit him hard. In his final two outings before the break, Gil looked much better against two good teams in the Red Sox and Orioles, allowing just two earned runs with 16 strikeouts and just one walk in 12.2 innings of work across those two starts.\n\nManaea (2024): 101.1 IP, 97 K, 41 BB, 10 HR, 3.73 ERA, 3.85 FIP, 96 ERA-\n\nManaea has continued to be a perfectly decent mid-rotation starter for the Mets, which has really been the case since his first season in Queens started. He faced the Yankees in one of the two games at Citi Field in June and held them scoreless through five innings despite issuing five walks and only striking out three.\n\nCole (2024): 29.1 IP, 34 K, 10 BB, 6 HR, 4.60 ERA, 4.71 FIP, 117 ERA-\n\nThe 2023 American League Cy Young winner really hasn't looked like himself since returning from the injured list in mid-June, but his last two starts have been pretty similar to Gil's. In 12.0 innings total against the Orioles and Rays, Cole gave up two earned runs with 15 strikeouts and just two walks. Also like Gil, he faced the Mets in the previous Subway Series and struggled, as the good guys hit four home runs and scored six runs against him in just four innings of work at Citi Field.",

Both New York squads are above .500 and playing well as we near August. The Yankees boast one of the best records in MLB while the Mets have been on a hot streak, winning 7 of their last 10. On top of that, we're in for a treat with some serious offensive firepower set to take to the plate tonight - Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso are among the best in the league.\n\nTonight's game starts at 7:05 p.m. ET on TBS from Yankee Stadium. Keep scrolling for a look at the latest odds, best player prop picks and a prediction of tonight's game.\n\nTonight's pitching matchup pits Luis Gil against Jose Quintana. Gil is having a superstar season while Quintana is putting together a respectable past month following a rough April and May.\n\nThis will be Gil's 2nd stint against the Mets this season, and the last outing didn't go too well for him. The Mets handed Gil the L with 4 hits across 4 innings, driving in 5 runs in a 12-2 blowout loss (see highlights in below section). I expect a better outing from Gil tonight in front of a \"home\" crowd.\n\nI also expect another high scoring affair, which favors the Yankees as they get to bat last. Given the fact the home team has won both previous matchups, I'm gonna roll with the Yankees to win straight up.\n\nMets vs. Yankees Odds\n\nOdds above via Caesars Sportsbook. Check out our Caesars Promo Code for a look at one of the best welcome offers in the business.\n\nFolks, this is going to be a good one. The Yankees are the more complete team on paper, but the Mets have been as hot as any team in MLB not named the Detroit Tigers. The Yankees are considered home favorites according to Caesars, sitting at -155 to win outright and +130 to win by 2 or more runs.\n\nThe Mets, meanwhile, are +130 to win outright and -155 to win or keep the game within a run at +1.5.\n\nThe Over/Under for this matchup has been set at 9 per Caesars, with the over just slightly favored. This total seems high because it is - both previous Subway Series matchups this season eclipsed 14 combined runs.\n\nGil was well under this total last time out against the Mets, and though I think he'll have a better outing than last time asking for 7 Ks against one of the hotter teams in baseball is a tough ask. The Mets are seeing the ball well this season too, averaging under a K per inning this season.\n\nThis total seems low to me for a guy who has surpassed this number in 5 of his last 6 outings against teams that have seen the ball better than the Yankees this season (Houston and Washington). I don't expect this to be the prettiest outing from Quintana, but 5 Ks is an achievable number.\n\nAlvarez had an excellent outing against Gil last time around, drawing a walk and a 2-run home run. He did struggle against Miami, but he had recorded a hit in 8 straight games prior to that series.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stone@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ethan Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Gil_(soccer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Gil (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBS_(American_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TBS (American TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23630258.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Yankees Prediction, Odds, Pick - 7/23/2024", "body": "The Subway Series is here, and we're sharing our MLB odds series and making a Mets-Yankees prediction and pick.\n\nThe New York Mets will head up 12 miles to battle their in-city rivals as they face the New York Yankees on Tuesday in the Bronx for the first of a two-game set. The Subway Series is here, and we're sharing our MLB odds series and making a Mets-Yankees prediction and pick.\n\nLast Start: Quintana labored in his last outing, going 5 2/3 innings, allowing five earned runs, six hits, striking out eight, and walking one in a loss to the Colorado Rockies.\n\n2024 Road Splits: Quintana has struggled on the road, going 2-2 with a 4.79 ERA over nine starts away from home.\n\nLuis Gil (10-5) with a 3.17 ERA\n\nLast Start: Gil dominated in his last outing, going six innings, allowing one earned run, five hits, striking out seven, and walking one in a win over the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Gil has done slightly worse at home, going 5-3 with a 3.29 ERA over 10 starts at Camden Yards.\n\nThe Mets have had a pretty solid season. Overall, they have done enough to compete and stay in the wildcard race. But they have work to do if they want to make a playoff run. Ultimately, they need their hitters to keep battering the baseball.\n\nPete Alonso may not be a Met for the long term. For now, he is the best player on this team but has struggled against the Yankees in his career. Alonso is batting only .218 with 19 hits, eight home runs, 22 RBIs, and 17 runs over 24 games against the Yanks. Yet, he has done slightly better at Yankee Stadium, hitting .244 with 11 hits, six home runs, 16 RBIs, and nine runs over 12 games in the Bronx.\n\nFrancisco Lindor is the other weapon who can create big innings for the Mets. Significantly, he is batting .317 with 65 hits, 10 home runs, 22 RBIs, and 45 runs over 51 games against New York. Jeff McNeil is not the player he once was. Yet, he is hitting .337 with two home runs, 13 RBIs, and 12 runs over 24 games against the Yankees.\n\nQuintana has been efficient, with two quality starts in his last three. Meanwhile, he has done well against the Yanks, going 3-3 with a 2.97 ERA over eight showdowns with the Bronx Bombers in his career. When Quintana finishes, he will turn the ball over to a bullpen that is just 19th in baseball in team ERA. Edwin Diaz is the closer for now, as he has had some trouble finishing games this season.\n\nWhy The Yankees Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Yankees have had an amazing season and hope to continue pummeling opponents. Despite that, they are only a wildcard team in the American League, as they play in the same division as the Baltimore Orioles. The Yanks need to do more to make a clean run, and they need more from their offense.\n\nAaron Judge is having an MVP-caliber season. Ultimately, he is the best hitter in this lineup. Judge will be in a prime spot to clobber the Mets in this one. Significantly, he is batting .329 with 27 hits, 12 home runs, 22 RBIs, and 17 runs over 23 games against them. Juan Soto will try to get things going in front of him. Overall, he is hitting .290 with 75 hits, 18 home runs, 45 RBIs, and 45 runs over 76 games.\n\nGil has been good lately, notching two quality starts in a row. Now, he hopes to fool a Mets' lineup that has been hitting well lately. When Gil finishes, he will turn it over to a bullpen that is the sixth-best in baseball. Clay Holmes is the man who is ready to shut the door down if the Yankees take a lead into the ninth.\n\nThe Yankees will cover the spread if their power hitters clobber the baseball and create large innings. Then, they need Gil to continue to find the strike zone.\n\nFinal Mets-Yankees Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Mets are a mediocre team when it comes to covering the spread, while the Yankees are just over .500. Additionally, the Mets have hovered around .500 on the road against the run-line record, while the Yankees are below .500 at covering the run-line record at home. The Mets took the first two games of the season series, winning both games in Queens. In fact, they have either split the season series or won it since 2017. The Mets are 5-1 against the run line for the last six games against the Yankees. We expect another close showdown in the Bronx. The Mets cover the spread.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

New York is 7-3 straight up in their last 10 games. The Mets are 48-51 ATS this season.\n\nThe New York Yankees are 60-42 straight up this year. New York is 5-5 straight up in their last 10 games.

Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nNew York Mets DFS Spin\n\nMets second baseman Jeff McNeil drove in half of his team's runs in their 6-4 win over the Marlins on Monday. In that contest, McNeil hit out of the #8 spot in the lineup and went 1 for 3 with a homer, 3 RBIs, and a run scored. The 32-year-old out of Santa Barbara, California is batting .221 with 8 homers, 30 RBIs, and an OPS of .622 across 336 plate appearances this season. Jeff McNeil has an OPS of .846 over the past 15 days, making him worth a look in most DFS formats.\n\nNew York Yankees DFS Spin\n\nYankees catcher Austin Wells reached base 3 times in his club's 9-1 victory over the Rays on Monday. Hitting out of the cleanup spot, the New York backstop went 3 for 5 with a homer, an RBI, and 2 runs scored. Across 211 plate appearances this year, Wells is hitting .223 with 7 homers, 21 RBIs, and a .715 OPS. The 25-year-old Scottsdale, Arizona native is batting .261 against lefties this season. That means Austin Wells could draw a start behind the plate against Mets southpaw starter Jose Quintana on Tuesday.\n\nMets vs. Yankees MLB Betting Trends\n\nThe Mets are 8-12 straight up in interleague games this season.\n\nThe Mets are 22-24 straight up as an underdog this season.\n\nThe Yankees are 48-36 straight up as a favorite this season.\n\nThe Yankees are 35-24 straight up after a win this season.\n\nMets vs. Yankees Betting Prediction\n\nThe Yankees will start right-hander Luis Gil against the Mets on Tuesday night. Gil is having a breakout campaign, as he's pitched to a 10-5 record with a 3.17 ERA in 2024. Gil's peripheral stats are solid as well. In 19 starts this year, the 26-year-old Dominican national has a WHIP of 1.08, a K/9 of 10.4, and an opponent batting average of .171. Luis Gil has tossed 9 quality starts this season, and I like his chances to fire another one here.

The Mets improved to 29-13 after a 24-35 start.\n\nThe Yankees (60-44) are 10-22 following a 50-22 start and 1-8-2 in their last 11 series after opening 17-3-2. They have yielded 34 homers over 18 games in July and gave up five in a game for the first time in two years.\n\nThe Yankees were 4 for 36 with runners in scoring position against the Mets this year.\n\nSean Manaea gave up Gleyber Torres' leadoff homer in the first and Juan Soto's 26th home run in the third, but the Mets (53-48) overcame 1-0 and 2-1 deficits and moved five games over .500 for the first time since they were 14-9 in April 2023.\n\nCole (3-2) allowed six runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings, raising his ERA to 5.40.

Taylor also made a sprawling backhand catch in center that robbed Alex Verdugo of a hit leading off the bottom half.\n\nWith the Mets ahead 5-2, Adam Ottavino (2-2) got Anthony Volpe to ground into an inning-ending forceout with the bases loaded in the fifth.\n\nManaea gave up two runs, three hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings.\n\nThe season-high crowd of 48,760 was the Yankees' 14th sellout, one shy of their 2023 total.\n\nTorres, restored to the top of the batting order for the first time since April 9, hit his first career leadoff homer.\n\nSoto made a leaping catch to rob Jeff McNeil at the top of the right-field wall for the final out of the second. McNeil had homered in his previous two games, including a tiebreaking, two-run drive that lifted the Mets to a 3-2 win Tuesday.\n\nLEFT EARLY\n\nYankees pitching coach Matt Blake left before the start of the game when his wife went into labor for the delivery of their first child.\n\nDRAFT\n\nThe Mets agreed to a minor league contract with Oklahoma State outfielder Carson Benge, the 19th overall pick in the amateur draft.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: Rookie RHP Christian Scott won't throw for two weeks but is expected to pitch again this season after an MRI of his ailing right elbow did not show a severe injury. ...

So, a pop-up from current Yankees albatross Alex Rodriguez, seemingly right into the glove of current Mets' comeback kid Luis Castillo, feels like it could be a turning of the tides during their June 2009 crosstown clash.

For years they've insisted these games mean exactly the same as any other games they play, against the Reds or the Red Sox or the Rangers or the Rockies. One of 162, all of that.\n\nAnd look, we get it: This isn't 1970 anymore where the Yankees could take supreme delight in winning the Mayor's Trophy Game over the defending-champion Mets that was meaningless except to the 49,569 people that represented the third-largest crowd at Yankee Stadium that year, and to players like Fritz Peterson, who walked off the field with his index finger jabbing the sky, a la Joe Namath.\n\nAnd no, we understand: This isn't 1977, when the Yankees got hammered by the Mets in St. Petersburg, Fla., in a game that was televised back to New York and sent George Steinbrenner roaring into the postgame clubhouse where he nearly fired Billy Martin for the first time, so fearful was he of a mass exodus of ticket buyers from The Bronx to Queens because of that outcome.\n\nAnd, sure: None of it will ever compare to 2000 (until we get that again).\n\nStill, this time, it doesn't feel like rhetoric, or forced detachment. Even the games the teams played at Citi Field in June didn't have the kind of big-picture importance the next two days at Yankee Stadium will.\n\nThen, the Yankees were just at the start of what's been a difficult stretch that was halted, for a day at least, by a 9-1 romp over the Rays at the Stadium. Then, the Mets were playing better but were still loitering under .500 and lingering on the periphery of the N.L. playoff picture. Then.\n\nNow ... well, as a man familiar with both ends of the Subway Series would put it: \"It's getting late early out there.\" The Mets held on to beat the Marlins in Miami, 6-4, so they come in holding fast to the third wild card, a half game out of the second one. The Yankees win allowed them to maintain a three-game loss-column lead over the Red Sox for the third wild-card spot, and stay within three in the loss of the Orioles.\n\nIt may still seem vaguely interesting to watch the Mets and Yankees play each other on the same field in games that count. But the greater concern for both teams is maintaining their status. They are at a juncture of their seasons when every win is essential, with the trade deadline looming a week away.\n\n\"We want to win,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"It's not even so much about the Mets, it's where we are in the season. They're the next ones in the way. It's not overly personal for us.\"\n\nSaid Juan Soto, who has returned from the All-Star break raging hot and hit a pair of scalded home runs Monday afternoon: \"We are just trying to win games. Whatever happened in the past is past. Try to win that series and keep on rolling.\"\n\nAnd sure: The Yankees know what Luis Severino said the other day, how in a text thread he needled a few ex-teammates by pointing out they only have \"two hitters.\" That won't be on the home bulletin board Tuesday because it's meaningless. Far more meaningful was the 10-for-22 performance from their 4-through-9 hitters, including homers from Austin Wells, Anthony Volpe and -- no, that was not a mirage -- DJ LeMahieu.\n\nIt's good to remember that the Yankees are still tied with the Phillies for the most games in which they've scored five or more runs -- 51 -- and that they are still one of just three teams to have reached 60 wins.\n\nThe Mets? Monday represented the final game of a 35-game stretch in which they played 33 times against teams at or under .500 (and two against the Yankees at their depths). They went 23-12, (exactly the record a certain Post columnist predicted at the outset) which has allowed them to look at themselves far differently than 35 games ago.\n\n\"We want the same mindset,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"One day at a time, come to the ballpark, prepare, compete, worry about the game at hand. We have the Yankees [Tuesday] so we need the same approach to continue to play well.\"\n\nThey get the Yankees now. They get the Braves this weekend, and then the Twins, and then an August in which they'll spend most of their time on the road. The fun is over. The serious stuff is afoot. And the Yankees will serve as their welcome-back to the varsity. That's the stakes. And that's more valuable than the Mayor's Trophy ever was.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

New York has plenty of tradeable players on expiring contracts. But their recent surge has the Mets squarely in the playoff hunt.\n\nBecause of this, David Stearns and company wanted to take a \"threading the needle,\" type approach at the deadline. The Mets still want to compete in 2024 - even moreso now - but they understand that they must continue to build for the future. Buying and selling at the trade deadline would be the best way to accomplish that.\n\nHowever, New York might not be the sellers many expected them to be. If they want to stay in the playoff race, players like Luis Severino, JD Martinez and Jose Quintana will be necessary. Some around the Mets organization believe it's worth the risk to hold onto their veterans to chase a playoff berth, via Ken Rosenthal, Patrick Mooney, Will Sammon and Katie Woo of the Athletic.\n\nAt the same time, those same sources understand that New York isn't a finished product. Improving in the bullpen is the team's biggest need. Still, the Mets aren't expected to go after the biggest relievers available on the trade market. They're concerned about the long-term value and overall prospect cost those players may bring.\n\nStill, New York does have the farm system to facilitate a trade. They were active sellers at last year's deadline, giving the team more opportunities to buy in 2024. The Mets will be able to land the reliever they desire without giving up the farm.\n\nAt one point, it looked like the Mets would be obvious sellers with the likes of even Pete Alonso being dealt. But New York continued to fight. They'll have a tricky deadline to maneuver and will 'thread the needle,' by trading for and away players. But while Stearns and company have the future in mind, the future has become just as bright in Queens.\n\nAt 52-48, the Mets are 11.5 games behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East. However, they currently hold a half game lead over the competition for the National League's final Wild Card spot. It'll be a grind for New York to earn their postseason spot, but they can see the light.\n\nWith an offense including five players who have 10+ home runs, New York's bats have stepped up in helping get the team back on track. The Mets rank eighth in the league in runs (481), fifth in home runs (127) and 11th in batting average (.249).\n\nThe team's pitching staff hasn't fared as well, ranking 21st with a 4.19 ERA. New York could look to trade away from a slew of veterans such as Luis Severino (3.58 ERA), Sean Manaea (3.73) and Jose Quintana (4.02). However, the Mets are in need of more pitching rather than in a position to sell it away. Bullpen will be their biggest point of emphasis at the deadline.\n\nDavid Stearns knows the team isn't perfect and that some changes will need to be made for the Mets to reach their highest potential. But in the middle of a scorching postseason push, New York is unwilling to tear their roster apart.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_fappiano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Dan Fappiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stearns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Stearns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rosenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Rosenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MLB-rumors-How-Mets-can-thread-needle-at-trade-deadline.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Yankees are 10-20 since their slide started, which is better than only the White Sox, the punching bags of the South Side who are challenging the historic 1962 Mets.\n\nWhen the New York teams met late last month, our matchup man extraordinaire Dan Martin gave just about every edge to the Yankees, and no one complained (except me, a little). Now he has them just about even, which is fair.\n\nWhile the Mets are only three games over .500, their deadline goal should be extraordinarily simple. First let's dispense with the idea they will become a big seller and trade Pete Alonso. That's insanity. The players worked their way into this position for a team in the biggest market with the richest owner. If they sell now, they should move to Des Moines. Anyway, I doubt they will.\n\nThe great thing about the Mets' current situation is that they already own the very two things most teams lack: rotation depth and lineup depth. The Mets possess enough starting pitchers that enabled them to move the emerging Jose Butto to the bullpen, and the lineup has a chance to contain threats one through nine if former batting champion Jeff McNeil can get his act completely together (among ex-batting champs, he's at least ahead of DJ LeMahieu, whose first homer Monday was celebrated as if he'd discovered the Fountain of Youth, which is one idea).\n\nThe Mets can consider right field if they like (red-hot poser Randy Arozarena would be interesting), and if they want to get cute, they could even trade from their rotation stash once Kodai Senga shows he's some semblance of the ace he was a year ago, as Mike Puma suggested weeks ago. But their lone pressing need remains obvious: they must bolster a bullpen that's mostly moved to the season injured list (Brooks Raley, Drew Smith), the temporarily injured list (Reed Garrett) or low-leverage situations (Adam Ottavino, Jake Diekman).\n\nIt'll be a seller's market for just about everything, but the good news is this: relievers still cost quarters on the dollar compared to positional starters or certainly rotation mainstays at a time when the Mets remain intent on keeping their prospect stash together.\n\nThe rotation that was the best in baseball for two-plus months became close to the worst for a month. The lineup that was the best in the game for those same two-plus months was close to the worst for that same month.\n\nFor weeks the Yankees were talking like they needed only a bullpen reinforcement or two. Now, if that's their total take, fuhgetaboutit.\n\nThe pen still needs some help, especially of the swing-and-miss variety, that's true. But now they will need to look more seriously at rotation help. While the Yankees have talent galore among their starting stable, Gerrit Cole, the game's best pitcher, is generally looking effective since his return, and Clarke Schmidt is coming back soon, they need help. And incidentally, despite a report, I still doubt they'll surrender the \"next Aaron Judge\" (i.e. Spencer Jones) for Garrett Crochet, who's a better fit for a team like the Dodgers with a big lead due to his innings crunch.\n\nThe Yankees' most glaring issue, however, is that two-superstar offense that's unlikely to work come the playoffs. Luis Severino was already my favorite local player to interview for his unusual honesty, and it turns out he talks similarly among friends as his memorable remark that the Yankees \"have only two good hitters\" in a trash-talk session with former pinstriped pals proves, is darned close to the truth.\n\nI'd only edit Severino's comment slightly to say two \"all-time great hitters\" but his point hit the target. I won't go over all the ugly numbers here, but suffice to say, it's hard to imagine a lineup composed of the game's two best hitters and seven guys who are struggling will go anywhere in October.\n\nThe Yankees presumably will have to assume guys with track records who are in their primes like Alex Verdugo and Gleyber Torres will regain some semblance of form, and hope that Giancarlo Stanton will produce as he did before his annual injury. A third baseman looks like a must, with Luis Rengifo, Jonathan India, Matt Chapman and Isaac Paredes among potential targets.\n\nThey'll need to do something. To rely on assumption and prayer at this point would be folly. As constituted, the Yankees simply are not good enough.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Earlier this season, Manaea pitched five scoreless innings against the Yanks, but he also walked five batters. He'll need to have better control on Wednesday.\n\nAaron Judge: The New York Yankees superstar walked four times on Tuesday night, seeing very little to hit from starter Jose Quintana. Judge has 35 home runs already this season, and he's posted an MLB-best .439 on-base percentage. Will the Mets give him anything to hit tonight?\n\nBack on June 25, Cole was rocked by the Mets, allowing seven hits and six runs across four innings of work.\n\nThat was just his second start back from an elbow injury, and the Yankees ace has looked much better as of late, allowing just two total runs across 12.0 innings of work in his last two outings.\n\nWhile Manaea has pitched well in 2024, he did struggle in his last outing, and he's failed to get through six innings in six of his last nine outings.\n\nThat's an issue since the Mets have a 4.14 bullpen ERA in the 2024 season, and they allowed a run in Tuesday's win that made things a little interesting heading into the final innings.\n\nI'm trusting Cole to stay hot in this game, and the Yankees are 4-2 in his six starts so far in 2024.

He had nothing but good things to say,\" Maton said Monday before the Mets' series final with the Marlins. \"And obviously getting over here, first day, it felt like a really good group of guys. It can be rare in baseball to have that, so I was fortunate to come to a team that has good clubhouse chemistry.\"\n\nThe Mets brought in Maton, a 31-year-old righthander, for cash or a player to be named to help stabilize a bullpen that had been hit hard by injuries and underperformance. He has done just that in a small sample since, allowing one run in four appearances (and striking out six of 11 batters).\n\nAside from the on-field results, Maton described a smooth off-field transition, which isn't always the case for players who move midseason.\n\n\"Personnel is all really good, analytics are great, love the coaching staff. It's made everything a lot easier,\" Maton said. \"It just seems like all really good people.\"\n\nConcrete signs of Jose Butto's adaptation to life as a reliever: He has been warming up for and recovering from his outings quicker, manager Carlos Mendoza said.\n\nFor a starting pitcher who got plunked into the bullpen when the Mets were desperate, that is a welcomed development. Both jobs involve throwing the ball from the mound to the plate, but the preparation is very different.\n\nThe Mets were wary upon calling Butto up at the start of the month of using him too much in this new way. But he has handled everything they've thrown at him.\n\n\"The last time we used him here in Miami [on Saturday], we called down and pretty quickly we got a call back from the bullpen that he was ready. So that's a good sign that he's adjusting to the new role,\" Mendoza said. \"And the way he's recovering. After he threw that inning, he came in the next day and said he was feeling pretty good. It's good, the fact that he's adjusting this quickly to the bullpen role. It's going to be important for us.\"\n\nButto has posted 8 2/3 scoreless innings across five appearances as a reliever. Mendoza maintained that the Mets view him as a starter long-term and did not rule out a return to the rotation this season.\n\nThe Mets made official a major-league contract with catcher Logan Porter and assigned him to Triple-A Syracuse.\n\nNeeding depth at that position, the Mets didn't have any backstops on the 40-man roster after Francisco Alvarez and Luis Torrens. And two of Syracuse's catchers are on the injured list.\n\nPorter, 29, played briefly with the Royals last season, his only major-league action. He'd spent this season in Triple-A with the Giants and Royals.\n\nThe Mets designated reliever Cole Sulser for assignment to clear a spot on the 40-man roster.\n\nMark Vientos checked out fine Monday, a day after getting hit in the helmet on a pickoff attempt. But Mendoza wanted to give him a game off anyway. \"It's pretty scary when one of your players gets hit like that in the head,\" he said. \"I thought today was a good day to have him down\" . . . Despite his struggles at the plate, DJ Stewart batted fifth both because Mendoza wanted him, a lefthanded hitter, to break up a string of righties and because he sees reasons for optimism from Stewart. \"I like where he's at,\" Mendoza said. Stewart entered the game with a slash line of .167/.302/.241 over the previous three months.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Maton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Maton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Sulser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Sulser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Torrens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Torrens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_rosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball rosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pickoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.projects.newsday.com/logos/nd-fb-share-logo-600x315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Yankees currently sit 1.5 games back of the Baltimore Orioles in the division after picking up their 60th win of the season (one of four teams to get there in 2024) on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Mets, on the other hand, hold the third and final wild card spot in the National League, but they're just half a game up on the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres.\n\nCan the Yankees get their revenge at home after falling behind 0-2 in the season series?\n\nHere's a look at the odds, starting pitchers and my prediction for tonight's matchup.\n\nPete Alonso: Mets first baseman Pete Alonso has been hot since the All-Star break, picking up four hits over his last three games while also scoring two runs. In his career against the Yanks, Alonso is hitting just .218, but eight of his 19 hits are home runs. Don't be shocked if he goes deep on Tuesday night.\n\nLuis Gil: After a rough stretch in late June into July, Luis Gil has returned to his early-season form in his last two outings. The rookie allowed just one run in each of his last two starts, striking out 16 players over 12.2 innings of work. While the Yankees did lose one of those games (they didn't score), Gil has kept them in nearly every game this season, leading to New York going 13-6 in his 19 starts.\n\nThe key for the Yankees in this matchup will be Gil, as he's looked the part once again in his last two starts. After a five-start stretch from June 9 through July 2 where he posted a 8.85 ERA, Gil has rebounded nicely, giving up just two earned runs and nine hits over 12.2 innings of work.\n\nHe takes the mound against Mets lefty Jose Quintana, who was allowed three or fewer earned runs in 10 of his last 11 starts. Granted, he allowed five runs in his last outing, but this could be a good matchup for Quintana since the Yankees rank just 19th in MLB in OPS against lefties.\n\nBoth of these teams have hit the OVER in more than 55 percent of their games this season, but I'm going to go against the grain and take the UNDER.\n\nThe Mets are much better against lefties (top-five in OPS) than righties in 2024, and the Yankees offense only features two players (Aaron Judge and Juan Soto) who have been true threats over the last month.\n\nI don't see the Mets scoring a ton of runs again, even though they got to Gil in his start against them in late June.\n\nThere's some value in taking the UNDER at nearly plus money.\n\nPick: UNDER 8.5 (-102)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Gil_(soccer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Gil (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3152,h_1773,x_0,y_75/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j3fr4b26h5b8cat6r2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "dateEnd": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1883, "textEnd": 1904}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

It was a complete performance with home runs from unlikely sources in D.J. LeMahieu, Anthony Volpe and Austin Wells, as well as slugger Juan Soto crushed his 24th and 25th home runs of the year, the sixth-most in MLB and his fourth multi-homer game in Pinstripes.\n\nCarlos Rodon also looked like how he started the regular season, going seven strong innings, giving up only two hits on one solo home run with a season-high 10 strikeouts in arguably his best start so far in 2024 in the 9-1 victory over the Rays in the series finale on Monday afternoon at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe Mets are also coming off of a four-game split, after a 6-4 victory over the Marlins in the series finale in Miami as they continue to battle for a playoff position with ace Kodai Senga set to make his first start of the MLB season versus the Braves on Friday at Citi Field.\n\nIn the first edition of the Subway Series, it was all Mets as they outscored the Yankees 21-9 in the two-game sweep in Queens less than a month ago on June 25 and 26.\n\nWith the Yankees battling for an American League East crown and the Mets fighting for a spot in the playoffs, these two outcomes could certainly be a deciding factor in a division tile or postseason berth.\n\nHere are the pitching matchups for the Yankees and Mets Subway Series battle in the Bronx:\n\nYankees vs Mets pitching matchups for Subway Series\n\nAnalysis: After suffering four straight losses, Gil finally got back in the win column for the first time since June 14 with a 6-1 victory over the Orioles last Saturday. For a second consecutive start, he gave up only one run and has a 16:1 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his previous 12 2/3 innings pitched.\n\nGil did face the Mets in the previous Subway Series iteration and was roughed up, surrendering five runs and more walks (4) than strikeouts (2) in 4 1/3 innings in the Mets' dominant 12-2 victory.\n\nTaking the mound for the Mets will be Quintana, who's making his 20th start of the season. The veteran southpaw will look to get back on track, as he had his worst start in two months (5 2/3 innings, five earned runs, including four home runs) after back-to-back appearances where he pitched seven shutout innings versus the Nationals when the calendar changed to July.\n\nQuintana's last two road appearances have been solid (13 1/3 innings, no runs, eight hits and nine strikeouts), he still carries a 4.79 ERA on the road with opponents hitting .269 against him in 47 innings.\n\nGerrit Cole will make his second start in the Subway Series this season. The reigning AL CY Young Award winner had his worst outing the first time around, allowing season-highs in earned runs (6), hits (7) home runs (4) and didn't record a single strikeout, only the second time in his career he's failed to do so.\n\nThe good news is it's been much better for Cole since then, giving up one earned run and pitching five or more innings and earning a victory in three of his last four starts.\n\nOpposing the Yankees' ace will be Manaea. The 32-year-old veteran was performing well recently up until his first start back from the All-Star Break where he surrendered five runs on eight hits and tied a season-low with one strikeout in a 6-4 loss to the Marlins last Friday. This was the first loss for Manaea in seven outings, as his last defeat came back on June 8 versus the Phillies.\n\nOutside of the start in Miami, Manaea has pitched decently on the road, not conceding more than three runs in any of those eight previous starts away from Citi Field.\n\nThe good news too is the 6-foot-5 left-hander had a solid showing when he faced the Yankees last month, giving up no runs on two hits allowed in five innings. The only blemish is he walked a season-high five batters in the Mets' 12-2 victory on June 26, but has given up only seven free passes since in 21 innings pitched so far in July.", "source": {"uri":

Today's Mets vs. Yankees predictions are largely avoiding the moneyline, and instead approaching the total.\n\nWith mostly sharp lines across the board in this matchup, I'm only seeing an edge on the total.\n\nI project 9.2 runs tonight, and I'm happily grabbing the Over 8.5. It should be a lovely, warm evening in Yankee Stadium, with the wind blowing slightly out. That's an excellent place to start creating an environment for scoring runs. But more than that is the matchup at hand.\n\nJose Quintana will grab the mound for the New York Mets, and it's been a tough season for the lefty. He comes into this game with one of the worst expected ERAs in baseball at 5.17. That's problematic in itself, but his struggles, in particular, will be an issue against the New York Yankees lineup.\n\nQuintana's hard-hit rate is in the bottom 15% of baseball, and his barrel rate is below the league average. As we've heavily documented, the Bronx Bombers are one of two teams that rank in the Top 5 in both barrel and hard-hit rates. That's a problem for Quintana this evening. This relatively low for a Yankees team against a pitcher like Quintana reflects New York's struggles against left-handed pitching. However, there are more than enough advantages to overcome those issues tonight.\n\nOn the other side of things, another start continues Luis Gil's compelling story. Has the league \"figured him out,\" or is this just a bit of rough luck? It's a little of both, but the Mets should be able to get after him enough today to push this total over.\n\nGil's most significant issues are relatively straightforward: He walks too many batters (11.7%, highest among qualified starters) and opponents barrel up the ball too often against him when he finds the zone. The Mets favor him well in each of those metrics, particularly in barrel rate, where they rank fifth. There's a direct path to plenty of runs this evening.\n\nMets vs Yankees same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nIt's pretty simple at this point. If the Yankees face left-handed pitchers who have issues giving up the hard-hit ball, I'm betting on Aaron Judge. Today, I'm pairing the Over 1.5 bases of Aaron Judge with our best bet.\n\nWhy? It's pretty simple. Judge will come into this one with terrific numbers against left-handed pitching. He has the 6th highest isolated power rating against left-handed pitching of any batter in baseball. Pretty self-explanatory. If Judge can avoid being walked by Quintana, then we love his chances here.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nMets vs Yankees trend\n\nThe New York Yankees have hit the Run Line in 40 of their last 71 games (+14.80 Units / 18% ROI).

A 3-2 loss left me feeling like this Yankees season is approaching a crossroads.\n\nAt this point, with all of their struggles, there's no real argument against blindly fading the New York Yankees until they turn it around. The team has numerous issues, particularly the current offensive holes in the lineup. With that said, I can't quite get there with this number, as my projections see no edge. However, we are focusing on the other part regarding the offensive holes in our handicap.\n\nMy best bet is Sean Manaea Over 2.5 walks issued as he'll grab the mound for the New York Mets this evening.\n\nMost teams' approach is to let anyone but Aaron Judge or Juan Soto beat them. Given the alternatives around them, and it's a sound strategy. There are few runs to be found after Judge in the lineup with Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo, and even Jose Trevino all hurt. We saw the Mets employ the \"anyone but Judge\" strategy last night when he was walked four times, two intentional and the rest featuring some non-competitive pitches. Why would that change tonight?\n\nIf that's the case, you're looking at Manaea having two walks before he steps onto the field. He's made it to the second time against a team's starting lineup in eight straight starts, including the last time he faced this Yankees team. He walked five Yankees in that outing, which makes this line all the more perplexing. That lineup was more threatening, sure, but he was also forced to pitch to Judge in those situations and will be far less willing to do it today.\n\nThere's a lot to like here. I projected nearly four walks for Manaea if he makes it five or more innings. The Judge factor weighs heavily here, most certainly, but in addition to that, Sean Manaea has had trouble with walks all season. He'll enter today with a walk rate in the highest 20% of baseball.\n\nMets vs Yankees same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nYou can guess where I'm going here. Since Judge is such a significant factor in this best bet, I'm pairing it with Judge not to get a hit.\n\nJudge hasn't had back-to-back games without a hit since the series against the Tampa Bay Rays a month ago. However, he has yet to be approached like this. Judge isn't getting chances to get hits because he's not getting competitive pitches. With that in mind, we're getting a price on something that doesn't factor in much correlation when there's quite a strong one. I'm inclined to take a stab at such an attractive number here.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nMets vs Yankees trend\n\nThe Mets have hit the Team Total Over in 57 of their last 91 games (+16.85 Units / 15% ROI).

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2024 Subway Series shifts to the Bronx as the Yankees host the Mets for the second and final two-game series between the two New York rivals this season.\n\nThe Mets swept the first two games at Citi Field in Queens last month and the two teams' fortunes have not changed much since then.\n\nFollowing a disastrous start to the season, the Mets have rebounded well to get back into the National League Wild Card picture. They went 25-11 to end the first half as one of the hottest teams in baseball.\n\nThe Yankees, meanwhile, have not been able to get out of their own way. Since starting the season 50-22 -- becoming the first team in Major League Baseball to reach 50 wins on June 14 -- the Bronx Bombers went 9-20 in their next 29 games entering Monday's series finale against the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nOnly the putrid Chicago White Sox, who are trying not to set an MLB record for the worst season ever, have had as bad a record as the Yankees during that stretch.\n\nMuch of it has to do with an offense that has provided zero support for Aaron Judge and Juan Soto. While the fearsome duo slashed .303/.446/.596 with 16 home runs during that 29-game stretch, the rest of the Yankees slashed a paltry .205/.284/.329 with 18 home runs, per MLB.com's Bryan Hoch.\n\nThe pitching has been even worse, especially with the starting rotation, as its 6.24 ERA was the worst in the majors.\n\nWill they find a way to rebound against the team from across town? Or will the Mets keep their hot summer going?", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_pantorno@amny.com", "name": "Joe Pantorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-06-26T042547Z_1949249182_MT1USATODAY23623595_RTRMADP_3_MLB-NEW-YORK-YANKEES-AT-NEW-YORK-METS.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 923, "textEnd": 930}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Now, over a decade later, they have done so once more. After winning the first two matchups between the two teams at Citi Field last month, the Mets defeated the Yankees tonight at Yankee Stadium for the second straight night -- this one a 12-3 shellacking -- to secure the season sweep and (more importantly) continue their push for a wild card spot.\n\nThe two teams started off the night by trading solo homers with each other. The Yankees got the scoring started after Gerrit Cole recorded a 1-2-3 inning to open the game. Sean Manaea took the mound for his twentieth start of the season, and Gleyber Torres -- who also hit a home run in last night's game -- greeted him with a lead-off bomb, quickly putting the Mets in a 1-0 hole. The Mets nearly got their first homer of the night in the second, when Jeff McNeil just barely missed one to right field, but they successfully got on the board in the third when Tyrone Taylor hit a majestic homer to left field to tie things up. The tie did not last for long, however, as with two outs in the bottom of the frame Manaea surrendered the third solo homer of the game -- this time to Juan Soto -- to give the Yankees a 2-1 lead.\n\nThings took a turn in the fourth inning when the Mets took the radical step of hitting a home run with a baserunner on. After J.D. Martinez started the frame with a leadoff single, Pete Alonso came up and socked a ball beyond the left field wall to give the Amazins their first lead of the night. Once they realized that hitting two-run shots was allowed, the team decided it was so fun that they would go ahead and do it again, with the top of the fifth inning proceeding exactly like the fourth did -- leadoff single (this one off the bat of Taylor), followed by a two-run shot, this one off the bat of Francisco Lindor (his twentieth homer of the year, giving him his second straight 20/20 season), putting the Mets up 5-2.\n\nManaea, meanwhile, kept the ball in the ballpark for the remainder of his night, but he did continue to struggle with baserunners. He allowed two runners on -- on a walk and a single -- in the fourth inning before working his way out of it. Then in the fifth, after recording the first two outs to start the frame, he lost control of the strike zone and allowed three baserunners -- on two walks and a hit-by-pitch -- and Carlos Mendoza gave him the hook. The Yankees had a chance to both erase the lead and hurt Manaea's ERA, but Adam Ottavino came on and got Anthony Volpe to weakly ground out to end the inning. Thus, Manaea's final line -- 4.2 innings, 3 hits, 4 walks, 4 strikeouts, 2 runs -- did not end up being quite as awful as it might have been, though it certainly left much to be desired, and it put the Mets in the position of once again needing to rely on the bullpen for a large chunk of the game.\n\nIn order to help ease things on their beleaguered relievers, the Mets decided to try scoring some more -- this time without the use of the long ball. With Cole still out there, McNeil hit a one-out double in the sixth, and then moved to third on a fielder's choice. Alvarez then reached first on a pitch clock violation-induced walk, which brought up Taylor -- who already had two hits on the night. He promptly recorded his third, an opposite field single which brought McNeil home and sent the reigning Cy Young winner to the showers having given up six runs in 5.2 innings. Tim Hill came on and ended the inning there.\n\nThe Amazins thus now had a four-run lead -- but there was still the matter of getting four more innings out of the bullpen. Danny Young came on for the bottom of the sixth and got the first two outs, but then issued a walk and allowed another runner to reach on a chopper back to the mound which Young threw into right field. This error put runners on first and third, but Young was able to generate a swinging strikeout from Torres to end the frame with the four-run lead intact. The other lefty Young (Alex) then came on for the bottom of the seventh after the Mets were held scoreless in the top of the inning. He surrendered a leadoff double to Soto and then had to contend with Aaron Judge. But for the second straight night, an unremarkable lefty reliever got the best hitter in baseball to strikeout looking, and then got soft outs from the next two batters.\n\nAt this point, the Mets remembered that it had been a while since they hit a home run, so they decided to change that. Mark Vientos led off the eighth inning against Hill with his thirteenth homer of the year, extending the lead to five. The Amazins were far from done; McNeil's second double of the game caused Hill to leave the game for Caleb Ferguson, and a single to Jose Iglesias then put runners on first and third. After Francisco Alvarez struck out looking, Taylor came up and hit a ground ball to third base. Oswaldo Cabrera threw the ball home with McNeil breaking for the plate, but the throw was a bit high, and McNeil slid in safely for another run. Lindor then took the next pitch and deposited it into the Mets' bullpen for his second homer of the game, this one a three-run shot to make it 11-2. Two walks sandwiched between a double loaded the bases (and Ferguson left the game amidst that for a new pitcher), and Vientos then drove in his second run of the inning -- this one on a mere sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Mets ended their scoring barrage there having built a ten-run lead, and suddenly there was much less concern about how the bullpen would manage the final two innings. Young pitched a 1-2-3 bottom of the eighth, and after a scoreless top of the ninth, Adrian Houser came on to end the game. He did surrender the first bullpen run of the night -- off an RBI single from Austin Wells to make it 12-3 -- but it hardly mattered at this point. He ultimately finished things off, and the Mets had their fourth straight win against the Yankees and third straight win overall. The team now must prepare for a crucial four-game series against the Braves -- and thanks to the offensive explosion tonight, they will head into this matchup with their biggest relievers having gotten a much-needed night of rest.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amazin' Avenue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_drago@amazinavenue.com", "name": "Michael Drago", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

J.D. Davis in the cleanup spot? Anthony Volpe right behind him?\n\nLuis Severino taunting his former team (and friends) with that \"two good hitters\" lineup jab becomes more prophetic by the day. In the Yankees' case, the truth hurts.\n\nOf course, it was easier for Severino to poke his pinstriped buddies when he didn't have to step back into the Bronx lion's den and take the mound wearing the Mets' colors. That duty fell to a pair of lefthanders, Jose Quintana and Sean Manaea, allowing Severino to watch from the safety of the visitor's dugout.\n\n\"They know it was just a little inside joke,\" Severino said before Tuesday night's game.\n\nStill, the Yankees haven't been in the best of moods lately. Even after beating up the Rays with Monday's rare offensive outburst, they've lost 20 of their last 30 games, scrambling to find consistency with either the lineup or the starting rotation. Looking at Tuesday's batting order, Boone probably figured that alignment couldn't do any worse, as long as Juan Soto and Aaron Judge remained in their regular slots.\n\nJones, making his leadoff debut, had never batted higher than fifth while playing in only 30 games, a limited series of cameos that helps explain why his offensive numbers (.256 BA, .734 OPS) are among the most respectable on the roster. He becomes the Yankees' fifth leadoff hitter this season, briefly dethroning rookie Ben Rice, who took a seat against the lefty Quintana.\n\nJust as surprising as Jones ascension, however, was the return of J.D. Davis to cleanup -- or in the lineup at all. The former Met made his Yankees' debut during last month's Subway Series, but has played in only five games. He just came off the IL with a severe stomach bug that not only sidelined Davis, but forced the Yankees to quarantine him in Tampa before the All-Star break as they finished the first half in Baltimore. Davis is supposed to be a weapon against lefties.\n\n\"It's the reason we brought him in here,\" Boone said pregame. \"Obviously with the illness, and getting back healthy now, a few days of work here, hopefully ready to roll and give us a little spark.\"\n\nTuesday's righty-heavy lineup was a dice roll for the Yankees, just the latest permutation in an effort to scrape up some production around the Soto-Judge steamroller. That's where Boone is at, until Giancarlo Stanton (hamstring) is ready early next month and maybe Jasson Dominguez (obligue) gets himself up to speed. With Dominguez expected to start playing at Triple-A Scranton within the week, the young slugger could be a welcome addition later in August.\n\nAs desperate as the Yankees are for impact bats, however, they're not in the same playoff pinch as the Mets, who aren't out of the woods quite yet as far as convincing the front office to buy big in the week leading up to the deadline. The weekend split of a four-game series in Miami wasn't a huge vote of confidence coming out of the All-Star break, and the Mets -- currently holding onto the third wild card -- are in the midst of another crucial stretch before July 30: the Subway Series, four against Atlanta at Citi, then the Twins come to Queens to finish the month.\n\n\"For us, as quickly as we got to that spot, it can easily go away,\" Pete Alonso said.\n\nAlong those lines, the Mets are facing the likelihood that rookie Christian Scott -- who had injected some youthful energy into the rotation -- will be lost for the rest of the season (and perhaps longer) after being diagnosed Tuesday with a sprain of his right UCL (often a precursor to Tommy John surgery). Manager Carlos Mendoza said before Tuesday's game that Scott was still being evaluated, but the nature of the injury is never optimistic for the short term.\n\nOn a positive note, Kodai Senga remains on schedule to make his season debut Friday against Atlanta, but the sobering Scott injury was just the latest example of why the Mets could never seriously consider trading a starter in order to bolster another area of their roster. When Senga was on the horizon, and Scott was healthy, it did appear that the Mets had a surplus of starters. But that abruptly changed, and if they're going to stay in contention, the Mets need to hold on to as many of their rotation arms as possible.\n\nScott aside, it was business as usual for the Mets before Tuesday's Subway Series opener, and they weren't pulling names out of a hat for that night's lineup. Maybe a bit sleepy, sure. But fully functional.\n\n\"We're ready to go,\" Francisco Lindor said.\n\nNo rest for the weary when it comes to a playoff push.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With the tying runner on base, Diekman was forced to go after vaunted Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who had walked in each of his previous four plate appearances. He struck him out looking with a 96-mph four-seam fastball before getting Ben Rice to ground out to end it.\n\nWith the win, the Mets (52-48) have taken three of the first four games of the 2024 Subway Series and have won three of their last four overall to keep their hold on the final National League Wild Card spot. The Yankees' (60-43) slide continues at least another night as they have dropped to 10-21 in their last 31 games.\n\nTrailing 1-0, McNeil was initially on the hook for a base-running error that forced the Mets to settle for only a tying run in the top of the fifth. He led off the frame with an infield hit and moved to second on Luis Torrens' single, Tyrone Taylor smacked a 388-foot fly ball off the left-center-field fence. McNeil, however, was rooted to second expecting the ball to be caught and to tag up as Torrens sped toward him at second.\n\nOnce the ball hit the wall, McNeil could only move up to third while ushering Torrens back to second and limiting Taylor to a very long single instead of a two-RBI double. McNeil would come into score when Yankees starter Luis Gil hit Francisco Lindor in the arm to force in a run, but that was all the Mets would get.\n\nGil would be done after that fifth inning, allowing that lone run on four hits with one walk and six strikeouts on 91 pitches.\n\nMcNeil made up for it in spades with a two-run home run off Tonkin, just sneaking a liner over the right-center-field wall into the bullpen on a full count to make it a 3-1 game. The veteran lefty has nearly doubled his season's home-run total over the last five games, mashing four during that stretch to improve to nine on the season.\n\nAlex Verdugo cut the Yankees' deficit to 3-2 in the seventh with an RBI double -- a hole that stayed intact after the Mets failed to score with one out and the bases loaded in the eighth inning.\n\nWith slugging catcher Francisco Alvarez on the bench, Mets manager Carlos Mendoza opted to stick with Luis Torrens, who struck out for the second out. Tyrone Taylor went up 3-0, but Yankees reliever Luke Weaver battled back to strike him out and get out of the jam.\n\nHarrison Bader led off the ninth with a double but was picked off at third to squander another chance for the visitors.\n\nJudge was neutralized with free passes as he was walked four times on Tuesday night -- just the fourth time in his career that he has had a four-walk game. He also made a bit of Subway Series history in the process, becoming the first player in a Mets/Yankees matchup to be walked four times in a single game.\n\nGleyber Torres got the Yankees on the board with one out in the second inning, depositing the first pitch he saw from Mets starter Jose Quintana -- a 91-mph sinker that sat in the middle of the zone -- into the first rows of the right-center-field bleachers for his ninth home run of the season.\n\nIt was Torres' first home run since June 28, breaking a 15-game drought without one. As for Quintana, it was the fifth home run allowed in his last 7.1 innings, which featured four home runs hit by the Colorado Rockies off him on July 14 at Citi Field.\n\nThe Yankees put runners on first and second with no outs in the fourth inning to build a chance to tack on more off Quintana. But the No. 7 hitter, Verdugo, opted to drop a sacrifice bunt to move Torres and Anthony Volpe up 90 feet for the light-hitting catcher, Carlos Narvaez, making his first MLB start. He struck out before the struggling DJ LeMahieu flew out to right, allowing the Mets and Quintana to escape.\n\nQuintana would get through five innings, allowing one run on three hits with five walks and three strikeouts.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_pantorno@amny.com", "name": "Joe Pantorno", "type": "author", "isAgency":

After throttling him for six runs on four round-trippers on June 25, the Mets hung another six runs on him, featuring the 20th round-trippers of the season for both Lindor and Pete Alonso. Tyrone Taylor also contributed his sixth of the season on a night he went 3-for-5 and drove in two runs.\n\nThe Mets piled it on by scoring six runs and batting around in the eighth inning against the Yankees' bullpen, which featured Mark Vientos' 13th home run of the season and Lindor's second bomb of the night -- a three-run shot -- to cap the Queens club's power output at five round-trippers on the night.\n\nThe Mets (53-48) have won four of six games since the All-Star break to move past the St. Louis Cardinals for the second National League Wild Card spot and now just trail the Atlanta Braves for second place in the NL East by 1.5 games.\n\nGleyber Torres put the Yankees up from the get-go in the bottom of the first, jumping on a 2-2 cutter from Sean Manaea and depositing it into the left-field seats for the first lead-off home run of his career and his second round-tripper in as many days.\n\nThe red-hot Jeff McNeil nearly tied the game with his fifth home run in his last six games, lifting a deep fly ball to right-center. But Juan Soto leaped with his back to the wall and robbed the Mets' lefty, catching it with his glove at the top of the wall to end the second inning.\n\nTaylor did get all of a high, 2-2 Cole fastball with two outs in the third, lifting one well into the left-field seats to tie the game at one apiece. It was the first base-runner and hit allowed by Cole on the night.\n\nSoto got one right back for the Yankees, crushing his 26th home run of the season to dead-center in the bottom of the third. Manaea served a four-seam fastball middle-middle, practically an open invitation for the superstar to bomb it 443 feet and 110.9 mph off the bat.\n\nAlonso countered yet again for the Mets, smacking his 20th home run of the season into the left-center-field seats on the first pitch he saw from Cole with one on in the top of the fourth to give the visitors the lead.\n\nHe became just the fifth player in franchise history to record five or more seasons with 20-plus home runs, joining Darryl Strawberry (8), David Wright (6), Mike Piazza (6), and Howard Johnson (5). He also tied Wright for the most career home runs hit by a Met in Subway Series play with nine.\n\nThe Mets continued to sock Cole in the fifth. After Taylor singled to lead off the frame, Lindor jumped on the first pitch -- as Alonso did -- and sent a no-doubter into the second deck in right field for his 20th home run of the season to make it a 5-2 game.\n\nLindor achieved his fourth 20-plus-homer season as a Met, which further extends his franchise record. The franchise only had one instance before Lindor arrived in which a shortstop hit 20 or more home runs in a season.\n\nManaea allowed just one other hit outside those two solo shots over 4.2 innings with four walks that catapulted his pitch count to 103.\n\nTaylor tacked on a sixth for the Mets while driving Cole from the game when he snuck a single over Torres at second to score McNeil.\n\nThe Mets poured it on in the eighth inning, scoring six more while sending 11 men to the plate. Vientos led things off with a solo home run off Tim Hill. McNeil doubled and ultimately came around to score on a Taylor fielder's choice that saw Yankees third baseman Oswaldo Cabrera field the slow chopper and try to get McNeil at home despite there being no force out in play. It left no time for catcher Austin Wells to apply the tag.\n\nLindor followed with his second home run of the night, jumping on the first pitch yet again.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType":

Martinez -- although Martinez has been in a rut since the last Subway Series.\n\nEdge: Mets\n\nAlso since June 15, when the Yankees' slide began, the Mets top the majors in slugging percentage, while the Yankees are 26th, as they have missed Giancarlo Stanton's presence -- on top of the vanishing act from the non-Judge and Soto portion of the lineup.\n\nPerhaps long-awaited home runs from DJ LeMahieu and Anthony Volpe on Monday were a sign of things turning, but over the last five weeks, Judge and Soto had a slugging percentage of .596 and hit 16 home runs, compared to their teammates' .329 slugging percentage with 18 homers.\n\nSince the last time the teams met, Verdugo, Volpe and LeMahieu all rank in the bottom five among qualified hitters in OPS.\n\nAustin Wells figures to stay in the cleanup spot against a pair of righty starters, but the No. 4 hole has been a nightmare.\n\nPete Alonso went deep just once in 15 games prior to Monday and Francisco Alvarez's power numbers have slipped of late.\n\nPerhaps a trip to the Stadium will help.\n\nJeff McNeil's brutal season may be on the upswing, with six extra-base hits in his previous 38 plate appearances after 15 all season prior to this stretch.\n\nAnd Lindor has been dangerous since late May and has been even better this month.\n\nEdge: Mets\n\nThe Yankees stole their first bases in over a month on Sunday, while the Mets have a few more base-stealing threats.\n\nEdge: Mets\n\nVolpe and -- somewhat surprisingly -- LeMahieu, have good advanced metrics at shortstop and third base, respectively.\n\nTorres is barely average at second these days and Rice is a work in progress at first.\n\nBut with McNeil, Vientos and Iglesias shaky on defense and Alonso poor at first, only Lindor can be relied upon in the infield.\n\nEdge: Yankees\n\nTrent Grisham and Harrison Bader have been standouts in center for each team and Nimmo is good in left, but no one else is out there for his defense.\n\nEdge: Even\n\nMuch like most of the regular lineup, the Yankees have gotten little from their bench, with ex-Met J.D. Davis having almost no role since arriving from Oakland after being designated for assignment, Oswaldo Cabrera struggling, and backup catcher Carlos Narvaez has hardly been used.\n\nThe Mets have Luis Torrens to spell Francisco Alvarez, and DJ Stewart has previously had flashes of success.\n\nEdge: Mets\n\nGerrit Cole and Luis Gil are slated to start for the Yankees and both got knocked around in the first Subway Series, but the right-handers are pitching better of late.\n\nJose Quintana has been inconsistent, but has had success against the Yankees and Sean Manaea pitched well in his earlier outing against the Yankees this season.\n\nEdge: Yankees\n\nBoth teams have issues at closer, although Edwin Diaz has been solid since his return from a sticky-stuff ban.\n\nClay Holmes, at the back of the Yankees pen, hasn't been reliable.\n\nLuke Weaver and Michael Tonkin have been weapons for the Yankees, as has lefty Tim Hill, while Jose Butto has emerged as a reliever in Queens, but Adrian Houser's earlier eye-opening stats following his move out of the rotation have gotten far worse.\n\nEdge: Yankees\n\nAaron Boone and Carlos Mendoza worked together for years before finally going up against each other for the first time last month.\n\nThis season, Mendoza has stopped a tailspin and Boone hasn't.\n\nEdge: Mets\n\nThe Yankees were still in first place in the AL East the last time these teams met and have won just one series since then.\n\nThe Mets opened the second half with a shaky performance in Miami and have mostly taken advantage of weak competition.\n\nNow they head to The Bronx, followed by the Braves coming to Citi Field.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregory Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_LeMahieu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DJ LeMahieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

They are a 1 \u00bd games behind second-place Atlanta and begin a four-game series against it Thursday at Citi Field.\n\nThe Yankees, meanwhile, have lost 22 of their last 32 games.\n\nTyrone Taylor (three hits) and Pete Alonso hit the other home runs off Cole, and Mark Vientos added one off Tim Hill.\n\nCole was making his seventh start since returning from the injured list, where he spent the first 75 games of the season, and had appeared to be in mid-season form with his two best outings in his previous two appearances. But the righthander gave up six runs in 5 2/3 innings. After a Taylor run-scoring single in the sixth, Cole flipped his glove in the air to himself out of frustration.\n\nThe Mets have had the ace's number this season. They hit four home runs and scored six off Cole in four innings of their 9-7 win at Citi Field on June 25.\n\nMets starter Sean Manea allowed nine runners in 4 2/3 inning before he was lifted in the fifth with the bases loaded and two out. Adam Ottavino got an inning-ending force out and Danny Young Alex Young and Adrian Houser got the final 12 outs, though Houser allowed a run in the ninth inning.\n\nThe struggling Yankees offense managed only six hits.\n\nThe icing on the cake for the Mets was a pair of spectacular plays in the field. In the bottom of the second inning with a runner aboard and one out, third baseman Mark Vientos snared a hot shot that came of DJ LeMahieu and turned it into an inning-ending double play with a throw from his knees. And in the bottom of the sixth inning, Taylor laid out in left center to rob Alex Verdugo of a leadoff single.\n\nSearching for a solution at the top of the batting order, Yankees manager Aaron Boone went with Gleyber Torres in the leadoff spot for the first time since April 9 on the heels of the second baseman hitting his first home run since June 28 the night before. And it paid a dividend almost immediately as he hit Manea's fifth pitch into the left field seats for his 10th homer of the season.\n\nTaylor's home run tied the score at 1 until Juan Soto put the Yankees ahead briefly in the third with a solo home run. Alonso hit his 20th home run of the season in top of the fourth off a Cole cutter. The two-run homer provided the last lead change and gave the Mets first baseman four straight season with 20 or more home runs.\n\nLindor hit his first home run in the fifth inning, also off a Cole cutter, to make the score 5-2. When the Mets made it 6-2 on Taylor's single to right center, Cole's glove flip proved the end of his outing.\n\nThe Mets turned it into a laugher in the eighth inning, when they sent 11 men to the plate and scored six runs, highlighted by Lindor's second long ball.\n\nVientos' solo homer started the rally. Jeff McNeil doubled and took third on a Jose Iglesias single. Taylor hit a routine ground ball to third and DJ LeMahieu fielded it cleanly, but his throw to the plate was off target up the first base side and allowed McNeil to slide home safely. It was scored a throwing error.\n\nLindor's three-run blast to center followed and Vientos later capped the outburst with a sacrifice fly.\n\nThis is the seventh season that Lindor has hit 20 or more home runs. He also has 20 steals, making him a member of the 20-20 club for the fourth time and second year in a row.\n\nPut that with his 27 doubles and he joins only Howard Johnson, Darryl Strawberry, Carlos

But the way things are going for the Yankees lately, Diekman came up with the perfect fastball, a 96-mph laser that rode the inside edge of the plate, freezing the incredulous Judge.\n\n\"That last pitch to Judge was awesome,\" said Jeff McNeil, the Mets' own recent savior, whose two-run homer was the difference that night.\n\nAnd so the Yankees entered Wednesday's finale desperately needing Cole to change the narrative, to quiet the noise about the malfunctioning lineup, to make people stop citing Luis Severino's wisecrack about them essentially being a two-man offense. It's what Cole is paid to do, after all. That's what the $324 million is for, to paraphrase Mad Men's antihero Don Draper.\n\nSending out Cole, on the Bronx mound, was the matchup the Yankees had to win. Not for any down-the-road playoff stature. This was only one game in late July. But after losing the first three games of the season's Subway Series to the Mets, it had become a matter of pride. And maybe just a case of righting the ship, something that's always high up on the ace's job description, especially when he's the reigning AL Cy Young winner like Cole.\n\nThe same scenario didn't quite go as planned for the Yankees last month at Citi Field, where the Mets clobbered Cole for six runs -- including four homers -- in four innings. His velocity was scary low, sitting around 95, and since it was only his second start coming back from right elbow inflammation, there was immediate concern the health of Cole's arm was still an issue.\n\nCole assured everyone he was fine, and then proceeded to show that the Flushing fiasco was a false alarm. When Cole took the Stadium mound Wednesday night, he was considered to be at the height of his powers, beating the Rays and Orioles in his previous two starts with a 1.50 ERA. His average fastball velo was back up over 96 mph again and the strikeouts were on the rise, with 15 Ks (and two walks) over the past 12 innings.\n\nThat's the version the Yankees were expecting in his Mets' rematch. The Cole they had to have.\n\n\"Hopefully more of what he's been doing,\" manager Aaron Boone said before Wednesday's game. \"I feel like he's got a handle on his entire arsenal and has a lot of ways to get you out right now. He continues to trend in a really good spot.\"\n\nWhen the Yankees were sprinting to 50 wins, the first team to get there this season, Cole spent those first 2 1/2 months as the assistant pitching coach for a rotation that was performing at a level among the best in baseball. Ironically, after Cole's return, those same starters have regressed dramatically, pulling the group's collective ERA down to 5.87 since June 15, ranking them dead-last in the majors.\n\nSo rather than bolster an already capable rotation, Cole now finds himself in a position where he has to carry it, just as Judge and Juan Soto are relied on to do all the heavy lifting for the lineup. There's a big difference, obviously. Cole only pitches every fifth day, and for that reason, he's not allowed to have an off night. The Yankees can't afford a clunker from Cole, not with most of the roster incapable of picking up the slack.\n\nFrom the Mets' perspective, conquering peak Cole this time around obviously would be a significant accomplishment, on a couple of fronts. First off, they knew that wasn't the real Cole who threw BP back on June 25 at Citi, so Wednesday was a legit test against one of the game's very best. And secondly, Cole was the last Yankee standing between the Mets and their first Subway Series sweep since 2013 (the only one in franchise history). This would be a far more dangerous Cole, however, than the work-in-progress the Mets hammered last month.\n\n\"He was just coming off the injury, the down-time that he had,\" Mendoza said Wednesday afternoon. \"And we were pretty aggressive with his fastball. But when you watch his last two outings, he's on. Watching film of those, he's actively the guy we've all seen. We'll be ready for him. But yeah, he's on.\"\n\nPrime Cole is capable of transforming the Yankees back into the Bronx bully they're supposed to be, if only for a night. He brings attitude, swagger and -- most of all -- a burning hatred to lose. If that wasn't enough to slow the Mets' roll, and finally get the upper hand in this crosstown rivalry, then the Yankees have bigger problems than a no-show in this year's Subway Series.", "source":

However, the Mets are also battling the Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres, and Arizona Diamondbacks for that last playoff spot; Pittsburgh and San Diego are just a half-game out, while Arizona is just one game behind.\n\nThe Mets have a strong lineup and are getting Kodai Senga back in the starting rotation, so the main area for them to improve is the bullpen. Outside of closer Edwin Diaz and rookie Dedniel Nunez, none of New York's current relievers are reliable, with injuries and underperformance greatly hurting them.\n\nAccording to Joel Sherman of the New York Post, the Mets can look at two American League teams for bullpen help; those teams are the defending World Series champion Texas Rangers, and the perennially contending Tampa Bay Rays, both of whom are considering selling at the deadline. However, the Mets are hesitant to deal their top prospects or surplus of starting pitchers in a possible deal with these teams, while they will also be competing with the cross-town rival Yankees for these attractive trade chips.\n\n\"The Rays are under no financial duress to move someone from their pen, but closer Peter Fairbanks, Jason Adam, Kevin Kelly, and lefties Garrett Cleavinger and Colin Poche are going to garner attention,\" Sherman wrote. \"Jose Leclerc, David Robertson and Kirby Yates of the Rangers each have closer experience and could be Yankees or Mets targets. Their inclusion in the market would deepen the number of relievers and perhaps lower prices.\"\n\nThe Mets are primarily looking for bullpen arms with good control, while also looking for a dependable left-handed reliever. New York's current lefties in the bullpen are the unproven Danny Young and Alex Young, as well as the struggling Jake Diekman. As such, Cleavinger from the Rays would be a direct upgrade over Diekman; he has a higher strikeout percentage (29.1% for Cleavinger, 26% for Diekman), and although he also tends to issue free passes (12% walk rate), anything would be better than Diekman's disastrous 17.6% walk rate.\n\nJason Adam would also be a useful addition to the Mets; although he's a right-hander, he's one of the best relievers at generating swings and misses with a 34.7% chase rate and 27.1 strikeout percentage, while his 8.4% walk rate would only trail Nunez and Adam Ottavino for the lowest in New York's bullpen. The Mets had also acquired Phil Maton from the Rays just two weeks ago, so they already serve as good trade partners.\n\nAs for the Rangers, Kirby Yates may be out of New York's price range due to their hesitance to deal top prospects for him, as well as already having Edwin Diaz closing games. But David Robertson, who spent half of the 2023 season in Queens, would be another excellent upgrade; his 37% strikeout rate is among the highest of all qualifying pitchers in the majors, while his 8.1% walk rate would be the second-best among the Mets' current relievers (behind only Nunez). There's also Jose Leclerc, who may not be what the team needs due to his very high walk percentage (13.1), but is another tremendous swing-and-miss arm with strong pitching peripherals that could make him a strong setup man.\n\nOf course, the Mets won't be the only team bidding for these arms; New York's other team, the Yankees, are just as keen towards improving their own bullpen. There's also the matter of both the Rangers and Rays still having their competitive windows open beyond this season, so there is a chance that they choose not to sell these assets.\n\nBut with the Mets looking to gain the upper hand in a remarkably crowded playoff field, these arms are certainly worth discussing a deal for.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement Neitzel-USA TODAY Sports / Kim Klement Neitzel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New York Mets' success over the past two months has placed them in position to make the playoffs, and made them likely buyers at this year's trade deadline.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns will be willing to part with his team's future to improve their present.\n\nA July 23 article from The Athletic's Will Sammon noted that the Mets aren't looking to trade any top prospects at the deadline.\n\n\"If the Mets stay in playoff contention, they will look to add to their bullpen, but it would be surprising if they traded top prospects for a rental reliever,\" Sammon wrote.\n\nSammon noted that Stearns avoided parting ways with prospects to acquire elite relievers when he was with the Milwaukee Brewers. Therefore, top Mets prospects like Jett Williams, Luisangel Acu\u00f1a, and Brandon Sproat appear likely to remain in the Mets' organization once the July 31 deadline arrives.\n\nProspects aren't the only players New York wants to keep around. Sammon wrote, \"The Mets would be reluctant to deal from their starting rotation unless they get an offer that they deem too good to pass up.\"\n\nThis is somewhat surprising, considering that the Mets have a stable of solid starting pitchers, two of whom (Luis Severino and Jose Quintana) will be free agents after the season. Considering the need that some contending teams have for starting pitching, trading away one of their veteran starters for, say, some added outfield depth could make sense, given that it's unknown when outfielder Starling Marte will make his return from a knee injury.\n\nPerhaps Kodai Senga making his 2024 MLB debut later this week will convince Stearns that he can part ways with another starting pitcher to bolster his roster elsewhere for a playoff push.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stearns", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Stearns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Steinbrenner_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George M.

After getting pitched around in his first three plate appearances, Judge came up with Trent Grisham at second, first base open and one out in the seventh inning. Mendoza had a long mound meeting with Dedniel Nunez before plate umpire John Bacon flashed four fingers.\n\nThe Yankees replaced the struggling J.D. Davis with pinch hitter Ben Rice, who then flied out to the warning track. Anthony Volpe bounced to third to end the threat. The intentional walk to the Judge in the seventh marked the 12th time he had reached base in 13 plate appearances against the Mets this season, in three games, but scored only two runs -- on both of his own homers.\n\n\"Some teams take that approach,\" manager Aaron Boone said afterward. \"Look, we'll get that middle of the order more settled here hopefully in the coming days too and that changes the equation a little bit. But yeah, there's going to be times where teams take that approach.\"\n\nNot some. All of them should. It's a no-brainer at the moment. Then again, we probably won't be seeing J.D. Davis in the cleanup spot anymore. Or Jahmai Jones hitting leadoff, as he did Tuesday night. Another makeshift Yankees lineup went 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11 runners on base in suffering their 21st loss in 31 games.\n\nAvoiding Judge was a huge part of that for the Mets. At least early on.\n\n\"You saw it,\" Mendoza said. \"There's going to be situations where we go after him. There's going to be situations where the game will dictate how we attack him.\"\n\nThe game told Mendoza something different in the ninth, however, when the manager had to go with Jake Diekman because closer Edwin Diaz -- worn out from the previous night -- was unavailable. After a one-out walk to Juan Soto -- the other \"good hitter\" according to Severino -- Diekman was given the green light to go right at Judge. On this rare occasion, against perhaps the sport's most lethal hitter, it worked out.\n\nDiekman got the count to 2-and-2, then perfectly spotted a 96-mph fastball on the inside black, freezing Judge for the strikeout. From there, he retired Rice on a routine bouncer to second base, and Mendoza's strategy -- along with faith in his players -- delivered big dividends.\n\n\"To have the conviction to go to the danger zone there -- well, I think you can say anywhere in the strike zone is a danger zone with Judge -- but for him to just stay on the attack and be aggressive when he needed to be,\" Mendoza said. \"He's been in this league for a long time for a reason. And he showed it today.\"\n\nThe sleep-deprived Mets, whose plane issues didn't get them back from Miami until sunrise early Tuesday morning, were supposed to be the groggy team heading into the Subway Series opener.\n\nAnd yet it was the Yankees, fully-rested after Monday's Bronx matinee rout of the Rays, who posted a lineup card that Boone apparently plucked from some reality-warping fever dream. Except for those \"two good hitters\" in their usual spots.\n\n\"They know it was just a little inside joke,\" Severino said before Tuesday night's game.\n\nStill, the Yankees haven't been in the best of moods lately. Tuesday's righty-heavy lineup was a dice roll, just the latest permutation in an effort to scrape up some production around the Soto-Judge steamroller. That's where Boone is at, until Giancarlo Stanton (hamstring) is ready early next month and maybe Jasson Dominguez (obligue) gets himself up to speed. With Dominguez expected to start playing at Triple-A Scranton within the week, the young slugger could be a welcome addition later in August.\n\nAs desperate as the Yankees are for impact bats, however, they're not in the same playoff pinch as the Mets, who aren't out of the woods quite yet as far as convincing the front office to buy big in the week leading up to the deadline. The weekend split of a four-game series in Miami wasn't a huge vote of confidence coming out of the All-Star break, and the Mets -- currently holding onto the third wild card -- are in the midst of another crucial stretch before July 30: the Subway Series, four against Atlanta at Citi, then the Twins come to Queens to finish the month.\n\n\"For us, as quickly as we got to that spot, it can easily go away,\" Pete Alonso said.\n\nBut the Mets showed more reason to believe with Tuesday night's victory, a smart and savvy win over their crosstown rival.

Edwin Diaz remained parked on the bench.\n\nAfter walking Juan Soto -- the potential tying run -- on four pitches, Diekman froze Judge on an inside fastball for a strikeout and an all-important out in the final frame.\n\nDiekman grabbed the save against the heart of the Yankees' lineup and the Mets used a two-run home run by Jeff McNeil to continue their 2024 dominance over their crosstown rivals with a 3-2 victory in front of a sold-out crowd of 47,453 fans on Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe win helped the Mets move back to four game over .500 at 52-48, matching a season-high. They have now won all three of their matchups with the Yankees, clinching the season series.\n\nMcNeil's night helped alleviated another inefficient offensive night for the Mets, who were 2-for-10 with runners in scoring position and left eight runners on base.\n\n'Happy Jeff' McNeil home run is the big moment\n\nThe mood is beginning to shift for McNeil, who endured one of the worst starts of his career before the All-Star break.\n\nOn Monday after the Mets grabbed a split with the Marlins, Francisco Lindor called him \"Happy Jeff\" after he clocked his third home run of the second half.\n\nMcNeil continued to ride the wave one night later as he clobbered a go-ahead two-run home run into the home bullpen in right-center field off Yankees reliever Michael Tonkin. It was McNeil's fourth home run in five games since the All-Star break, giving him nine on the season. He also knocked an infield single and scored the team's opening run in the fifth inning off Luis Gil to finish 2-for-3 with two runs and two RBI.\n\nThe Mets second baseman, who slashed .216/.276/.314 with five home runs and 24 RBI before the All-Star break, is now 6-for-15 with four home runs, eight RBI and five runs in the second half.\n\nAlex Young helps shut the door in Mets debut\n\nPitching in New York poses its own challenges, but how about taking the ball trying to protect a one-run lead with a runner in scoring position and one out.\n\nThat was the situation facing left-hander Alex Young in his Mets debut after he was called up to replace an injured Christian Scott on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAfter Adam Ottavino gave up a leadoff single to Anthony Volpe and RBI double to Alex Verdugo, Carlos Mendoza called upon Young to protect a 3-2 lead.\n\nYoung was able to get Wells to fly out to right field before picking up a groundball from DJ LeMahieu. It was Young's first major-league action since he threw \u2154 of an inning on May 29 as a member of the Reds. The Mets claimed the left-hander off waivers from the Giants back on July 17.\n\nDedniel Nu\u00f1ez worked around his own catching error and a one-out intentional walk to Aaron Judge before picking up back-to-back outs and Phil Maton tossed a clean eighth inning.\n\nJose Quintana limits the damage\n\nOne thing was certain for Jose Quintana on Tuesday night: Judge was not going to beat him.\n\nIn his first start of the second half, the veteran left-hander issued three walks to the reigning American League MVP. Quintana emerged from those free passes no worse for the wear.\n\nAfter walking Judge, Quintana struck out J.D. Davis twice and induced another inning-ending double play. In five innings, Quintana allowed only one run on a Gleyber Torres solo home run in the bottom of the second inning.\n\nTwice, Quintana stranded a pair in the second and fourth innings, striking out Jahmai Jones in the former and fanning Carlos Narvaez and getting a fly ball from DJ LeMahieu in the latter.\n\nQuintana finished with one earned run allowed on three hits and five walks while striking out six in five innings. It had been nine days since Quintana pitched after his first turn out of the All-Star break was pushed due to an illness.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North

As front offices around the league decide whether to buy or sell - or land somewhere in between - the organizations' actions are ultimately out of the players' control.\n\nNew York Mets' star shortstop Francisco Lindor acknowledged that reality with an honest response when asked how the team will approach the \"heavy\" week leading up to the trade deadline.\n\n\"I mean, [it's] heavy on the front office,\" Lindor responded per SNY on X. \"That's their job. Let them deal with that. Let them make the decisions they gotta make.\" As for the players' role in all the wheeling and dealing afoot? \"We're here to play the game the right way and hopefully we're in the position where we can help them make better decisions that are gonna be... um... not like last year,\" Lindor told SNY.\n\nThe four-time All-Star seemed to be referring to the Mets' 2023 trade deadline when the team shipped out a number of key veterans, including Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander, David Robertson, Tommy Pham and Mark Canha, among others, essentially conceding the season. While the deadline deals helped to replenish the team's farm system, they also took the Mets out of contention. It was thought the team would need to reset and wouldn't be ready to compete again until 2025.\n\nHowever, the Mets managed to get right back in the thick of things this year. True, New York is 12 games behind the first place Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East. But if the season ended today the Mets would be headed to the playoffs with the final National League Wild Card berth. It would be the second time in the last three years that the Mets entered the postseason as a Wild Card team.\n\nOf course, the season doesn't end today and the moves made by organizations at this year's trade deadline will have a major impact on the rest of the season and the playoffs. But Lindor accepts that this is out of his hands.\n\n\"At the end of the day they're gonna make the decisions that they're gonna make. They're looking for this year but they're also looking for the future,\" he told SNY.\n\nUltimately, for Lindor, it comes down to doing his job and trusting that the front office does theirs. \"I trust [president of baseball operations] David [Stearns] and his staff and I'm here to play as hard as I can and to make sure the group continues to climb,\" he said\n\nThere was a time earlier this season when it appeared as if the Mets would trade All-Star slugger - and fan favorite - Pete Alonso. However, given the team's chances of making the postseason, it now seems unlikely New York will be sellers at the deadline. In fact, the Mets could even add talent.\n\nEither way, Lindor will stay in his lane, concerning himself with his on-field activities. It's worked out fairly well so far for the three-time Silver Slugger. Lindor has 26 doubles, 17 home runs, 52 RBI and 64 runs scored along with 3.7 WAR in 98 games so far this season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gianakos@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Gianakos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Canha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Canha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robertson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Robertson (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Scherzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Slugger_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver Slugger Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Mets-news-Francisco-Lindor-confronts-trade-rumors-with-honest-declaration.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 213}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The relief pitchers for the Yankees were among the three best in the majors for July with a 2.55 ERA, but didn't hold a tie score. Mets relievers were among the four worst with a 6.20 ERA for the month, yet held the lead.\n\nThere is a reasonable expectation that both teams' bullpens will look different in a week, after the July 30 trading deadline. Relief pitching is always at a premium at this time of year for contenders like the Yankees and Mets and have to be a consideration for both, regardless of other needs.\n\nYes, both teams have relievers in the pipeline back to the roster. The Yankees could add Scott Effross to their mix and the Mets have, among others, Reed Garrett and Sean Reid-Foley on the road back. Still the idea that Yankees GM Brian Cashman and Mets GM David Stearns could both be making moves, in the bullpen or elsewhere, makes the coming days highly anticipated.\n\n\"It's an exciting time for our sport,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before first pitch in the final game of the Subway Series Wednesday at the Stadium.\n\n\"As I sit here right now, and obviously I'm not as intimately involved as in this as [Cashman] . . . but I pay attention and have conversations with [executives] . . . [We're] six days out and it feels like today is going to be very different than the last day going into the trade deadline, with who actually is available, who is on the block.\n\n\"Does a team get super creative and change the landscape a little bit? You never know where it's going to go or what domino . . . leads to another move,\" Boone continued.\n\n\"But right now, it seems very cloudy, especially [with] a lot of teams, I'm sure honestly, not knowing if they're in or out. That will become more clear as we get closer.\"\n\n\"We've put ourselves in a better position compared to where we were in May so there's going to be a lot of rumors, there's going to be a lot of noise,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"We talk a lot. Whether it's [Stearns] or whomever from the front office. We continue to have conversations or they keep me in the loop . . . There's a lot going on and sometimes things happen and sometimes they don't happen. But there's always dialogue.\n\n\"This time of the year in baseball, there's excitement and there's rumors and there's noise but our job is . . . to continue to win baseball games,\" he added.\n\nWith both teams' bullpen compositions and personnel likely to change via trade or some other avenue, the managers' approach to relief pitching, as they described it, makes for an interesting contrast.\n\nBoth organizations do extensive pregame planning about deploying relievers. The Mets on Tuesday didn't have closer Edwin Diaz after he threw 28 pitches the night before in a win over Miami. Jake Diekman said he didn't foresee getting the last outs until the seventh inning, but ended up in that spot.\n\nAnd Mendoza revealed after Diekman got the final two outs with the winning run in the batters' box - including a big strikeout of Aaron Judge - that he'd gone mostly on instinct and batter-by-batter.\n\nBut, he said, it's not that unusual.\n\n\"I don't know that there's ever a time where you go with a game plan and you [can] stick to it,\" he said Wednesday afternoon. \"Every time you make an adjustment as the game unfolds, you have to adjust [the plan]. You have a pretty good idea going into it because of what you have available and the lineup you're facing [with] potential pinch hitters. But there's a lot that goes into it. You have to use your information and prepare and have an idea, but you have to make those adjustments.\"\n\nBoone described an approach that hewed more toward following the day's blueprint.\n\n\"In a winning scenario or where your starter goes out and gives you a good outing to set you up, usually you're able to then execute a game plan,\" Boone said. \"There's always a wrinkle that gets thrown or an inning that [makes] things a little different. But those are things you try to talk through ahead of time and try to be prepared for. [You] try to be able to remain agile while the game is unfolding.\"\n\nAsked how he might handle the situation with personnel changing in the bullpen at the trading deadline, Boone replied, \"You try to have a real strong understanding of their skill set and their strengths and their weaknesses and who the opponent is and who [they] might be facing.\"\n\n\"In the end you're trying to match up to be successful,\" he added. \"I feel there's a handful of guys, even a couple guys that we didn't necessarily account for at different points in the season, that have carved out a nice little role for themselves. [Guys] that are becoming real contributors for us. As a guy or two changes or comes into the mix hopefully that only strengthens us.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cashman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Cashman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Effross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Effross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Diekman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Diekman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZjQ5OGMyNWUtMWZmNy00:OWZiNTc4/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 453, "textEnd": 460}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

And the Mets had already begun their impressive ascent from the low point of 11 games under .500 on June 2 to postseason contention.\n\nEach team's momentum continued in those two games with the Mets taking both. Beginning with those two wins, the Mets had gone 14-9 entering play Tuesday while the Yankees had gone 8-14.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone and Mets first-year manager Carlos Mendoza go back a long way. Mendoza was Boone's bench coach for four seasons before the Mets hired him this past offseason. And while the two were about lock horns again, Boone took a moment to remark about how his former right-hand man had helped steer the Mets back.\n\n\"I think he's handled himself really well and obviously, that's a presence for them over there - not surprising to me,\" Boone said.\n\n\"He's been through a lot already in the first few months with some of the struggles and some of the things you've just got to deal with on and off the field,\" Boone added. \"I feel like he's - just looking from afar - handled everything really well. Again, not surprising.\"\n\nMendoza was looking at another turn of events to navigate even before game time. Righthanded starter Christian Scott was put on the 15-day injured list with what the team said was a UCL sprain in his right elbow. And Mendoza said the team was still uncertain about the extent of the injury or what it would mean for his starting rotation.\n\nAt least there was the salve of the return of righthander Kodai Senga to the rotation from a shoulder injury. Expected to be the team's ace this season, he is expected to pitch Friday against the Braves at Citi Field.\n\nMendoza has seen the Mets through a litany of events thus far, from losing Senga before Opening Day, to the club's early-season underperforming to closer Edwin Diaz getting suspended for 10 games after being deemed to have an illegal sticky substance on his hands in a game. Mendoza was prepared for this from his six seasons as an instructor and member of the field staff with the Yankees.\n\nWhen asked if his time with the Yankees informed him about how to handle these sort of in-season issues, he replied \"100%.\"\n\n\"I learned a lot when I was (here) with the Yankees,\" Mendoza continued. \"There was always (times), when you're playing 162, you're going to face adversity. And watching not only Aaron but (how) the players and coaches handled it here, helped me try and navigate our situation earlier this year.\"\n\nMendoza, however, seemed almost uncomfortable discussing his role in the Mets' turnaround.\n\n\"I'm going to give credit to the players: they were the ones that continued to prepare and continued to work,\" Mendoza said. \"And I have to give credit to the coaching staff. I (have) a very experienced coaching staff that helped me kind of get through those moments as well.\n\n\"I've been here for many years and (it) helped me.

And many impact options will be available in this year's market.\n\nEntering the MLB games today, the Mets own the final spot in the National League Wild card on the back of a strong last month of play. It has completely changed the narrative for the club in the second half. For weeks, they were viewed as likely sellers but might instead be buyers.\n\nAlso Read: New York Mets game today - Get watch time and channel for the next Mets game\n\nEarlier this week, MLB Network league insider Mark Feinsand added to that narrative when he claimed the Mets are \"firmly in the 'buyer' category\" just days away from this month's trade deadline. While there are various parts of the roster they can aim to improve, upgrading the bullpen is a must.\n\nAssuming team president David Stearns focuses on making the bullpen better for a playoff run, here are six relievers of varying notoriety the organization could target over the next week.\n\nMarlins closer is arguably the top reliever on this year's market. And it's understandable why. The All-Star has pitched to a 1.24 ERA in 42 impressive appearances this season. Scott would give New York an elite backup plan if Edwin Diaz can recapture his 2023 form or an outright replacement for the incumbent closer.\n\nAlso Read: 10 best New York Mets of all time - From Mike Piazza to Tom Seaver\n\nHaving a righty-lefty balance from the 'pen is always important, and the team is sure to be looking at the market for left-handers. The Rockers are expected to again be sellers this month and Jalen Beeks could be an affordable option.\n\nLike many relievers, he has had up-and-down seasons in recent years. And his 4.74 ERA isn't anything to write home about. But if you take him away from home his home games being in Denver, he could be a solid lefty addition for New York's 'pen.\n\nBeeks' Rays teammate Pete Fairbanks has been a good reliever for several years. But now, he has proven that he is a very reliable arm in late innings. Tampa will be in sell mode this week and acquiring Fairbanks would be a great move for the Mets.\n\nNot only would be be a benefit in 2024, but he is under team control for another season and has a club option in 2026. Both years are for very reasonable rates.\n\nAlso Read: 10 worst New York Mets of all time - From George Foster to Bobby Bonilla\n\nReds reliever Nick Martinez may be another veteran bullpen arm that could be on the New York Mets radar this week. Following a four-year stint in Japan, he has proven to be a reliable arm out of the 'pen over the last three years. The downside is that he comes off the books after this season. But that could also lower the cost.\n\nDespite being on a bad Angels team the last two years, Carlos Estevez has turned into one of the better closers in the American League. He is likely to be available this week and might be a more affordable option than Tanner Scott. He will definitely be in the team's crosshairs.\n\nTigers lefty Andrew Chafin has been a solid arm for much of his career. In the pursuit of balance in the bullpen, the 34-year-old would be a nice addition before July 30. Plus, he has a club option for next season. So if he turns out to be a disaster in New York in the second half, the team can move on from him in the offseason.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_burgos@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Jason Burgos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLB Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Fairbanks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Fairbanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Beeks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Beeks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Seaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Seaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Piazza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Piazza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Bonilla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Bonilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Chafin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Chafin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MLB-All-Star-Game-National-League-at-American-League-23757652.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 85, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

At last.\n\n\"Had my wife come pick me up when it was convenient,\" Ottavino said at Yankee Stadium before the Subway Series opener Tuesday night. \"I was comfortable. I was happy.\"\n\nFollowing a 6-4 victory Monday night over the Marlins in the finale of a four-game series, the Mets got delayed flying out of Miami. They sat on the tarmac in South Florida for at least 2 1/2 hours, pitcher Luis Severino said, waiting as their plane was properly fueled.\n\n\"I don't know how long it takes to put gas in the plane, but it took a long time,\" he said.\n\nSeverino said the Mets took off after 2 a.m. They landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport about 4:45 a.m., then bused across Queens to Citi Field, where players jumped in their cars around 5:30 a.m. and fought rush-hour traffic as they drove home in daylight.\n\nNew York Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez, left, and relief pitcher Edwin Diaz (39) shake hands after a baseball game against the Miami Marlins, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Miami.

We're ready to rock today.\n\n\"To be honest, it happens a lot. I mean, I know it's probably a story today because we're playing the Yankees,\" he added. \"But it happens way often more, but no one really cares because our job is to go out there and play regardless of the circumstances, and we're going to go out there and give it everything we've got. And there's really no excuses. We're all going to be ready to go. Pretty sure all of us have had at least eight hours of sleep, so we're ready to rock and roll.\"\n\nOttavino, however, said it was the latest (or earliest) he ever arrived back from a road trip on a game day during his 14 years in the majors.\n\n\"It wasn't fun. I wouldn't recommend it,\" the reliever said. \"I've landed with the sun up a bunch of times, but usually on an off day.\"\n\nOttavino didn't have his car at Citi Field, so rather than book a ride share home to suburban Westchester, he went to sleep at the ballpark for a while before his wife picked him up in the late morning and brought him home.\n\nOttavino said he felt \"dirty and gross\" so he showered first at the stadium. Hours later, he was in the Bronx getting ready for the crosstown-rival Yankees in a sleepy Mets clubhouse.\n\n\"That's part of what we do. Part of the life of a baseball player, baseball team. You know at some point throughout the year you're going to be facing things like that,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"We're here in the Bronx. Crowd's going to be electric. Important game. So I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nMendoza said he got home about 6:30 or 7 a.m.\n\n\"Ready to go now,\" he said with a smile.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nNew York Mets' Francisco Lindor, center, celebrates with Sean Manaea, left, and Luis Severino, right, after hitting a solo home run during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the Miami Marlins, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Miami.

The narrative seemed to be writing itself; the Mets, sluggish from their late arrival, would look sleepy against their crosstown rivals. But that wasn't the case: the Mets were able to execute their game plan and get enough offense to eke out a 3-2 win in game three of the 2024 Subway Series.\n\nThe plan was simple for the Mets and Jos\u00e9 Quintana: neutralize Juan Soto and Aaron Judge. Quintana was able to execute the plan early on, with not giving either player much to hit, content to walk either instead of throw a pitch down the middle. Pete Alonso recorded three straight outs off the bat of Soto, and Judge walked in his three plate appearances against Quintana.\n\nLuis Gil looked like a totally different pitcher than he did last month when he faced the Mets, with a much-improved slider that led to six strikeouts and one walk over his five innings of work.\n\nIn the bottom of the second, the Yankees got on the board with a solo home run from Gleyber Torres. Aside from some walks, this was the only blemish on Quintana's day.\n\nAfter threatening in the third inning but failing to score, the Mets finally got on the board against Gil in the fifth. Singles by Jeff McNeil and former Yankee Luis Torrens put two men on with no outs. A misread by McNeil on a fly ball to the fence off the bat of Tyrone Taylor led to the bases loaded with no outs, when McNeil and possibly Torrens should've scored on the hit. After a Harrison Bader fly out, Francisco Lindor was hit on the forearm to drive in the tying run. However, a strikeout to the suddenly ice cold Brandon Nimmo and a fly out off the bat of J.D. Martinez ended the threat with just one run scoring.\n\nAlonso led off the sixth inning against old friend Michael Tonkin, lining a ball between second and third that rolled all the way to the wall for a double. A long fly to straight away center from Mark Vientos allowed Alonso to tag up to third base and put the go-ahead run 90 feet away with one out.\n\nThe suddenly red hot McNeil was up next, and deposited a 3-2 pitch into the right-field bullpen to put the Mets up 3-1.\n\nQuintana's day was done after five innings, with former Yankee Adam Ottavino pitching the seventh. A single down the left-field line from Anthony Volpe greeting Ottavino rudely. A hit and run followed by an Alex Verdugo double narrowed the Met lead to one and got Otto kicked from the game after just one-third of an inning. He's looking more cooked than a roast left in the oven for a couple of extra hours.\n\nNewest Met/second left-handed reliever with the surname of Young, Alex Young entered he game to face pinch hitter Austin Wells. A long, loud out to right field led to Verdugo tagging up to third. Young induced a ground ball to second off the bat of DJ LeMahieu to end the inning and the threat.\n\nAfter not scoring in the top of the seventh, Dedniel Nu\u00f1ez came in to pitch the bottom of the seventh and, while covering first base, dropped a toss from Alonso to put the tying run on base in the form of Trent Grisham. A wild pitch moved Grisham to second, but Nu\u00f1ez got Soto to strike out swinging for the first out. An intentional walk to Judge put two on with one out. Ben Rice hit a warning track shot that gave the Yankees some hope, but a ground out to third off the bat of Volpe to end the inning.\n\nThe Mets threatened in the top of the eighth, loading the bases with one out, but failed to score when Luke Weaver struck out Torrens and Taylor to end the inning.\n\nPhil Maton pitched a scoreless eighth to keep it a one-run game going into the ninth. Clay Holmes pitched the ninth for the Yankees and Bader led the inning off by reaching on a two-base error but then foolishly tried to steal third and got picked off, therefore ending the rally before it really started.\n\nOf course, in a one-run game, the Mets brought in [checks notes] Jake Diekman? To Carlos Mendoza's credit, the Yankees had two lefties leading off the inning (and a third in the four hole), so I get the thought process but...him? The southpaw got fellow lefty Grisham to hit a long fly ball to center that Bader handled on the warning track.\n\nSoto then walked on four terrible pitches to bring the winning run to the plate in the form of Judge. Somehow, some way, Diekman struck out Judge looking. C'mon now. A Ben Rice groundout ended the game, and gave the Mets the first three of four against the Yankees this season.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amazin' Avenue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_salvatore@amazinavenue.com", "name": "Brian Salvatore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Gil_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Gil (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gregory Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleyber_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gleyber Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrone Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Torrens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Torrens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Verdugo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Verdugo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_and_run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit and run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tag up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

A big reason for Gil's struggle was linked to his slider, which was not as effective as it had been earlier in the season. He asked for advice from Severino, who was happy to give it to his former teammate.\n\n\"The last start against us, the breaking pitches were not that good,\" Severino said on Tuesday night after the Mets beat the Yankees, 3-2. \"The one that I'm throwing now has been really good. He went to the bullpen, he tried, and he told me after that it's been unbelievable, so I'm really happy for him.\"\n\nGil started for the Yankees on Tuesday night and picked up a no-decision in the loss to the Mets. However, his slider was impactful on the Mets lineup, as Gil went 5.1 innings pitched allowing just one earned run on four hits with six strikeouts.\n\n\"Severino is someone that I've always looked up to, ever since he was here, came up through this organization,\" Gil said on Tuesday night through his interpreter. \"He's a pitcher with more experience than me. He has some knowledge to offer, and I took it into consideration and put it in practice here with our pitching coach. I'm getting really good results with that pitch.\"\n\nTo the neutral observer, Gil is simply leaning on a veteran, good friend and former teammate in Severino.

At last.\n\n\"Had my wife come pick me up when it was convenient,\" Ottavino said at Yankee Stadium before the Subway Series opener Tuesday night. \"I was comfortable. I was happy.\"\n\nFollowing a 6-4 victory Monday night over the Marlins in the finale of a four-game series, the Mets got delayed flying out of Miami. They sat on the tarmac in South Florida for at least 2 1/2 hours, pitcher Luis Severino said, waiting as their plane was properly fueled.\n\n\"It was terrible,\" Severino said with a grin. \"I don't know how long it takes to put gas in the plane, but it took a long time.\"\n\nSeverino said the Mets took off after 2 a.m. They landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport about 4:45 a.m., then bused across Queens to Citi Field, where players jumped in their cars around 5:30 a.m. and fought rush-hour traffic as they drove home in daylight.\n\nFirst baseman Pete Alonso said he probably fell asleep at 7 a.m. or so.\n\n\"Yeah, the flight was nice,\" he said, tongue in cheek. \"We're good to go. We're ready to rock today.\n\n\"To be honest, it happens a lot. I mean, I know it's probably a story today because we're playing the Yankees,\" he added. \"But it happens way often more, but no one really cares because our job is to go out there and play regardless of the circumstances, and we're going to go out there and give it everything we've got. And there's really no excuses. We're all going to be ready to go. Pretty sure all of us have had at least eight hours of sleep, so we're ready to rock and roll.\"\n\nOttavino, however, said it was the latest (or earliest) he ever arrived back from a road trip on a game day during his 14 years in the majors.\n\n\"It wasn't fun. I wouldn't recommend it,\" the reliever said. \"I've landed with the sun up a bunch of times, but usually on an off day.\"\n\nOttavino didn't have his car at Citi Field, so rather than book a ride share home to suburban Westchester, he went to sleep at the ballpark for a while before his wife picked him up in the late morning and brought him home.\n\nOttavino said he felt \"dirty and gross\" so he showered first at the stadium. Hours later, he was in the Bronx getting ready for the crosstown-rival Yankees in a sleepy Mets clubhouse.\n\n\"That's part of what we do. Part of the life of a baseball player, baseball team. You know at some point throughout the year you're going to be facing things like that,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"We're here in the Bronx. Crowd's going to be electric. Important game. So I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nMendoza said he got home about 6:30 or 7 a.m.\n\n\"Ready to go now,\" he said with a smile.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_fitzpatrick@eagletribune.com", "name": "Mike Fitzpatrick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bader", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Bader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Per a report from Will Sammon of The Athletic, the Mets are hoping to do some buying but the extent of their shopping will likely come down to what other clubs are making available.\n\nThe Mets had a disastrous season in 2023. Despite running the highest payroll in MLB history, they fell out of contention and wound up selling at the deadline. That included flipping marquee names like Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander, eating salary in order to bring back greater prospects that bolstered their farm system.\n\nComing into 2024, they added to their roster but focused mainly on short-term deals, ideally improving their chances at competing in 2024 while leaving plenty of future flexibility intact. This year has had its ups and downs but they are currently 51-48 and in possession of the final Wild Card spot in the National League, so it makes sense that they would consider themselves buyers.\n\nHanging onto that playoff spot will be a challenge in a fairly crowded race. There are three clubs within a game of the Mets and seven within 4.5 games. Given that the club has been trying to restock its farm system and still isn't a sure thing for the playoffs this year, they may prefer marginal adds that don't involve significant prospect cost. Sammon reports that this is essentially how the club sees things, as they will be looking to make additions in ways that don't hurt them in subsequent seasons, a similar mindset to their recent offseason.\n\nSammon uses the recent Phil Maton trade as an example, since the Mets took that contract off the Rays' hands without having to surrender any prospect capital. Since the Mets have been willing to spend lavishly under owner Steve Cohen, taking on money in order to reduce prospect costs could logically be their preferred trading method. That's in spite of the fact that they are paying a massive 110% tax on any further spending since they are a three-time payor of the competitive balance tax that is well above the highest tier.\n\nSimilar trades to address the bullpen may be forthcoming in the next week, with Sammon using Chad Green of the Blue Jays as a hypothetical example. The Jays picked up a club option for Green's services that will pay him $21MM over the 2024 and 2025 seasons. They have now fallen out of contention and may have interest in ducking under the competitive balance tax, which could lead the two sides to line up on a trade that further bolsters the Mets' bullpen and mostly provides the Jays with salary relief. Regardless of how the trades ultimately play out, upgrading the bullpen makes plenty of sense since Mets' relievers have a collective 4.14 earned run average that placed them 19th in the league.\n\nBut as Sammon highlights, what the Mets do at the deadline will ultimately be determined by what's available. All year long, the narrative around this summer's deadline has focused on the lack of clear sellers. With the expanded playoffs, there are currently only six teams more than 7.5 games from a postseason spot. Per Sammon and other reports from around the baseball world, several clubs are still having various conversations and trying to figure out their plans of attack for the next week. Among the clubs that are firmly in the seller camp, some of them are rebuilding clubs that will likely be looking to maximize prospect hauls, such as the Marlins and White Sox.\n\nOne way or another, it seems the Mets will be making additions, even if they end up being modest. The flip side of that, of course, is that they don't intend to be sellers. There were times earlier in the season when the Mets were struggling and it seemed possible that first baseman Pete Alonso could be made available. He is an impending free agent and it would make sense to make him available if the club were out of contention.\n\nBut since they have climbed back into a playoff spot, that doesn't seem to be a possibility now. Sammon reports that the club is unlikely to trade Alonso, even if they suffer through a losing streak over the next week. That will mean leaving some trade value on the table but the Mets could recoup a bit of that by making Alonso a qualifying offer, though the pick would be fairly modest since CBT payors receive a compensatory pick after the fourth round.\n\nSammon also throws some cold water on the possibility of the Mets trading from their relatively strong rotation. It had been reported earlier this month that the Mets were considering selling a starting pitcher even if they stayed in the buyer camp, simply due to the number of viable starters they have on hand. Kodai Senga has been on the injured list all year but could be rejoining the club this week, entering a rotation mix that also consists of Sean Manaea, Luis Severino, Christian Scott, David Peterson, Jose Quintana and Tylor Megill, with Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 and Adrian Houser also on the roster but currently working out of the bullpen.\n\nThere would be some logic to trading someone from that group to upgrade another part of the roster and hoping that the depth would be strong enough to last through the season, but Sammon reports that the club will be reluctant to do so unless they get blown away by an offer. If such an offer were to be considered, Severino and Quintana would be the most logical candidates since they are impending free agents. Manaea could also return to the open market but he has a player option for 2025 that would complicate his trade candidacy.\n\nAgain, the external market forces figure to be playing a role here. As Sammon notes, a number of teams are looking for starting pitching and the lack of sellers might lead to the Mets getting some interesting offers that tempt them away from their preference for hanging onto the current group.\n\nSammon also adds that upgrading right field is another area the club could explore, with the caveat that it may be harder to accomplish that without giving up prospect talent. Starling Marte is having a solid season overall, with a line of .278/.328/.416 and 115 wRC+. But he's now 35 years old and his health has become an increasing problem in recent years. He's currently on the injured list with a bone bruise in his knee and the club has recently rotated Tyrone Taylor, DJ Stewart and Jeff McNeil through the position without any of them taking a firm hold of the job.\n\nThe list of possible trade candidates includes corner outfielders such as Taylor Ward, Randy Arozarena, Brent Rooker, Jesse Winker, Lane Thomas, Tommy Pham, Kevin Pillar and Miguel Andujar. But all of those guys are either still in their arbitration years or playing on modest free agent deals, meaning their current clubs would likely prioritize prospect-heavy returns as opposed to salary relief in any trade talks. Corner outfielders making notable salaries include George Springer, Mitch Haniger and old friend Michael Conforto, though it's unclear if the Mets would be interested in taking on significant money to get any of those guys.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darragh_mcdonald@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Darragh

They're not going to catch the Philadelphia Phillies for the NL East crown. They are plenty good enough to secure a wild-card spot though.\n\n\"I feel a lot better (about the team) than I did a month and a half ago,\" Mets POBO David Stearns said earlier this month (via the New York Daily News). \"... I think our group, our players, our coaches deserve a lot of credit for battling through what was a really tough May. Put us in a spot where if we continue to play well, we're a playoff-caliber team. That is certainly exciting, and certainly prefer where we sit today and the type of questions I'm getting today than what I got six weeks ago.\"\n\nA year ago, the Mets sold at the trade deadline, most notably eating a boatload of salary to maximize the return for David Robertson, Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander, and others. It is possible Stearns will buy and sell at the same time -- could he flip a rental starter like Jose Quintana or Luis Severino while adding long-term pieces? -- though, clearly, additions will be made.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Mets and their trade deadline situation.\n\nNeeds\n\nBullpen. Bullpen, bullpen, bullpen. It starts there. The Mets have an excellent offense and, other than maybe a new utility infielder, they are mostly set on a position-player side. The rotation is in decent enough shape too with Kodai Senga working his way back and top pitching prospect Brandon Sproat perhaps not far away either, although a recent UCL sprain landed Christian Scott on the IL with no timeline yet revealed. That said, you can always use more pitching.\n\nThe bullpen will be the No. 1 priority though. Righties Reed Garrett (who is currently injured) and Dedniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez have been revelations, and Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 looks like a multi-inning weapon, but veterans Jake Diekman and Adam Ottavino are showing their age, and Edwin D\u00edaz has been shaky at times. At minimum, he has not been anywhere particularly close to his dynamic 2022 self.\n\nThe Mets added veteran spin-rate monster Phil Maton earlier this month and will look to beef up the bullpen further at the deadline. A starting pitcher with long-term control could help as well. If the Mets do add on the position-player side, a corner outfielder would make the most sense given Starling Marte's ongoing knee issues.\n\nPossible trade targets Garrett Crochet CHW * SP * #45 View Profile\n\nIt is likely the White Sox will trade Garrett Crochet, their All-Star representative, and he is exactly the sort of high-end starter with long-term control the Mets should target. Crochet is already well over his previous career in innings, so it's hard to see how he can start through the postseason, but he could help the Mets with their bullpen issue the rest of this year (he of course has experience as a reliever) before slotting back into the rotation in 2025. He's only 25 and he's under team control through 2026. Every team would like to get Crochet and he fits what the Mets need short- and long-term especially well.\n\nLucas Erceg OAK * RP * #70 View Profile\n\nEveryone wants Mason Miller, the 104 mph-throwing Athletics closer. All indications are it will take a massive package to get him though, and I have a hard time seeing Stearns paying top dollar for a bullpen arm. Miller's setup man, Lucas Erceg, is very good in his own right. He's another hard-throwing righty who chews up right-handed hitters, has excellent strikeout and ground-ball rates, and is under team control through 2029. Stearns drafted Erceg when he was Brewers GM. Erceg was a third baseman at the time, and Stearns was still in charge when Erceg converted to pitching in Milwaukee's system. There's a history here. Hmmm.\n\nPete Fairbanks TB * RP * #29 View Profile\n\nThe Rays are willing to move anyone at any time, especially relievers making decent money like Pete Fairbanks. His strikeout and swing-and-miss rates are down significantly this season, ditto his fastball velocity, but Fairbanks started from such a high baseline that he's still very effective. He's owed roughly $6 million between now and the end of 2025, and if things go well, his contract includes an affordable $7 club option for 2026. For what it's worth, Stearns was the master at building high-end bullpens on the cheap during his time in Milwaukee. Trading prospects for a name reliever like Fairbanks might not be his cup of tea. Keep in mind the Mets and Rays recently hooked up for the Maton trade. The two sides have already been dialoguing.\n\nErick Fedde CHW * SP * #20 View Profile\n\nThe White Sox could control the pitching market at the deadline between Crochet and Erick Fedde. Fedde has been terrific this season, his first back in MLB after revamping his game in Korea, and he's signed very affordably next year ($7.5 million salary). Sean Manaea has performed well enough to opt out of his contract this offseason, meaning New York's only big-league starters under contract or team control next year are Senga, Megill, David Peterson, and Christian Scott (and I suppose Butt\u00f3). They don't want to ask too much of their pitching prospects in 2025. A quality veteran like Fedde helps the Mets this year, and also scratches a starter off their offseason shopping list.\n\nTanner Scott MIA * RP * #66 View Profile\n\nMy guess is Stearns and the Mets would prefer a reliever with multiple years of control, but there is nothing wrong with rentals, and Tanner Scott figures to be the best reliever on the trade market this summer. The Marlins are going to trade him, there's no sense in keeping him when he's going to be a free agent after the season, and he offers big velocity with high strikeout and ground-ball rates. Hard-throwing lefties are always in demand and the Mets would have to win a bidding war to get Scott, Miami's All-Star representative. I'm not sure that's Stearns' thing. Clearly though, Scott would be an immense help for the bullpen.\n\nTrade chips\n\nThe first few weeks of the season, we all wondered whether the Mets would trade Pete Alonso at the deadline, and that seems completely off the table now that they're in the postseason race. Moving a rental starter like Quintana or Severino while importing a pitcher with long-term control could be in the cards though, and I'm guessing the Mets would love to unload Jeff McNeil and the more than $30 million he's owed from 2025-26. Steve Cohen is baseball's wealthiest owner, but he doesn't want to pay that.\n\nThe Mets leveraged Cohen's wealth last deadline and ate salary to get better prospects. The dirty little secret is many of those prospects aren't doing so hot right now. Drew Gilbert (Verlander trade) just recently resumed playing games after missing three months with a hamstring injury. Luisangel Acu\u00f1a (Scherzer trade) is struggling to keep his head above water in Triple-A. Ryan Clifford (Verlander trade) is striking out roughly 30% of the time. Colin Houck, last year's first rounder, is flirting with a .600 OPS in Single-A, and Jett Williams, their 2022 first rounder, has been out since April with a wrist injury that required surgery. My hunch is the Mets weren't eager to trade these kids anyway, but, even if they were, their stock is not at its highest.\n\nStearns' time with the Brewers indicates he will be very protective of his young pitching (Scott, Sproat, Blade Tidwell, etc.), and now that the Mets have caught up to the league's other big-market teams with regards to pitcher development, I suspect that will be true again at the deadline. The Mets may try to address their bullpen needs using Cohen's wealth (i.e. take on money, like Maton) and by trading second- and third-tier prospects such as outfielder Alex Ram\u00edrez and catcher Kevin Parada.\n\nA wild-card spot is there for the taking and the Mets owe it to themselves to improve the roster at the deadline, and put the team in the best position for the stretch run and October. Stearns has to figure out how to do it without sacrificing from the top of the farm system. That's why he makes the big bucks. Cohen's money will undoubtedly help there. Adding to the bullpen is the easiest way to improve this team's outlook. The Mets simply allow too many games slip away in the late innings.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_axisa@cbssports.com",

Hours later, he was in the Bronx getting ready for the crosstown-rival Yankees in a sleepy Mets clubhouse.\n\n\"That's part of what we do. Part of the life of a baseball player, baseball team.

Their most obvious need is in the bullpen, and the trade deadline is one way to address that, though it is not the only way.\n\nPresident of baseball operations David Stearns could trade for the person who gets high-leverage relief outs in September and October -- or that person could end up being a Tylor Megill, David Peterson or Jose Butto. Bullpens are so fickle that it's hard to predict whether the Mets' eventual acquisition will be more impactful than their internal candidates.\n\nAnd while it's fun to churn up scenarios where Stearns pulls off a more dramatic move -- say, a package built around a Brett Baty for a player with name recognition like Jazz Chisholm Jr. or Mason Miller (just hypotheticals), sources say no such creative deal is currently under consideration, and is unlikely to happen.\n\nOh, and obviously the idea of trading Pete Alonso has been off the table for a while. Earlier in the season, when the Mets appeared to be sinking, the front office knew that it would have to consider moving rental stars like Alonso, Luis Severino and J.D. Martinez, unless the team turned its season around.\n\nYou know what happened after that. The team turned its season around.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stearns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Stearns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylor_Megill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tylor Megill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Chisholm_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jazz Chisholm Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Baty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Baty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Peterson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Peterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Marlins made it a 5-3 game again in the seventh, all before Lindor came through with another solo homer in the ninth.\n\nNew York brought in Edwin D\u00edaz to close things out, which he eventually did after running into some trouble.\n\nD\u00edaz gave up a walk and two singles, as well as an RBI groundout, before forcing Jake Burger into a game-ending popout. He got credit for the save, all while the Mets held on to win 6-4.\n\nAccording to TSN's StatsCentre, D\u00edaz now ranks fourth in Mets history with 108 saves. He was previously tied for fourth with Jesse Orosco.\n\nIt took D\u00edaz less than four seasons to climb so high on the leaderboard, as New York only acquired him in a trade with the Seattle Mariners ahead of the 2019 season. The 2020 campaign was also shortened by COVID-19, and he missed all of 2023 with a torn patellar tendon in his right knee.\n\nD\u00edaz was an All-Star and dark horse Cy Young contender in 2022, but he has yet to reach those heights again post-injury. Through 29 appearances this season, the 30-year-old righty has a 4.08 ERA and 12 saves in 17 opportunities.\n\nSince coming off the injured list on June 13, though, D\u00edaz has a 1.04 ERA, 1.038 WHIP and seven saves. The Mets have won each of his last 10 appearances, after starting the season 11-9 when he took the mound.\n\nAs for Lindor, Monday marked his 17th career multi-home run game. StatsCentre noted that Lindor now ranks sixth all-time in multi-home run games among MLB shortstops.\n\nLindor was previously tied with Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn. He now trails Vern Stephens, Cal Ripken Jr. and Nomar Garciaparra, who had 18 such performances each.\n\nAlex Rodriguez owns the record with 33 multi-home runs games, while Ernie Banks ranks second with 24.\n\nLindor, who has yet to be named an All-Star since signing with the Mets in 2021, is now batting .256 with 19 home runs, 54 RBI, 20 stolen bases, a .798 OPS and a 4.1 WAR this season.\n\nD\u00edaz, Lindor and the Mets open up a two-game set against the New York Yankees on Tuesday night.

teammates", "body": "Whether he is pitching for or against the Mets this season, Michael Tonkin has had zero luck.\n\nAfter the righty reliever's season began disastrously wearing a Mets jersey, his successful comeback in pinstripes took a detour against those same Mets in a 3-2 Yankees loss in The Bronx on Tuesday night.\n\nCalled upon in the sixth inning of a tie game, Tonkin witnessed the same kind of results he experienced as a Met reappear against his old club.\n\nHe served up a leadoff double to Pete Alonso, who moved to third on a long fly out from Mark Vientos.\n\nTonkin could not finish off Jeff McNeil during an eight-pitch at-bat, the seventh pitch a foul tip that catcher Carlos Narvaez could not hang on to.\n\nGiven another chance, McNeil reversed a 93 mph, full-count fastball over the wall in right-center for the go-ahead runs and a lead that the Mets would not surrender.\n\n\"Slider would have been the better option, but execution wasn't there either,\" said Tonkin, who was charged with two runs in 1\u2009\u00b9/\u2083 innings. \"I'm trying to go up [in the zone] there, and it wasn't up.\"\n\nTonkin's ERA rose to just 2.04 as a Yankee.\n\nHe has been a solid, multi-inning and occasional back-of-the-bullpen threat for a team that has needed him, but his worst moments this season have just about all involved the Mets.\n\nThe 34-year-old veteran won a spot in Carlos Mendoza's Opening Day bullpen with a strong spring.\n\nHe was used twice in extra innings in the first week of the season, allowing a combined eight runs (two earned) in a pair of losses to the Tigers.\n\nHe was designated for assignment, pitched for the Twins for one game, was DFA'd and found his way back to the Mets, who watched him let up two runs in three innings before a second DFA by the same team in the same month.\n\nThe Yankees put in a claim, asked him to throw more sliders and two-seamers, and he was fixed.\n\nTonkin has been an answer in a bullpen filled with questions, and one that has lost Jonathan Loaisiga, Ian Hamilton and Nick Burdi to injury.\n\nBut with McNeil in the box, the Mets got a glimpse of the only Tonkin they have known this season.\n\n\"I

Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports / Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNew York Yankees star righthander Luis Gil, who is 10-5 on the season with a 3.10 ERA through 20 starts, leaned on former teammate-turned-crosstown rival, New York Mets pitcher Luis Severino, for advice on how to improve his slider.\n\nAfter a dominant first 14 starts to the season that saw him go 9-1 with a 2.03 ERA, Gil was touched up in the following three starts beginning in mid-June, when he allowed 16 runs over 9.2 innings pitched. A big reason for Gil's struggle was linked to his slider, which was not as effective as it had been earlier in the season. He asked for advice from Severino, who was happy to give it to his former teammate.\n\n\"The last start against us, the breaking pitches were not that good,\" Severino said on Tuesday night after the Mets beat the Yankees, 3-2. \"The one that I'm throwing now has been really good. He went to the bullpen, he tried, and he told me after that it's been unbelievable, so I'm really happy for him.\"\n\nGil started for the Yankees on Tuesday night and picked up a no-decision in the loss to the Mets. However, his slider was impactful on the Mets lineup, as Gil went 5.1 innings pitched allowing just one earned run on four hits with six strikeouts.\n\n\"Severino is someone that I've always looked up to, ever since he was here, came up through this organization,\" Gil said on Tuesday night through his interpreter. \"He's a pitcher with more experience than me. He has some knowledge to offer, and I took it into consideration and put it in practice here with our pitching coach. I'm getting really good results with that pitch.\"\n\nTo the neutral observer, Gil is simply leaning on a veteran, good friend and former teammate in Severino. To Mets fans however, Severino committed a cardinal sin, especially when Gil's success came against Severino's own team based on advice that he was willing to give to a former teammate.\n\nAs expected, the always rational Mets fans were very upset by this development on social media.

These were two former batting champs -- LeMahieu twice, once in each league -- who had fallen, couldn't get up, couldn't hit the ball hard (or out of the infield much, especially LeMahieu), were hurting their lineups and were albatrosses on their team's payrolls through (looking this up to confirm) 2026.\n\nSo any nuggets of positivism are cherished -- and McNeil has had a moment of revival. He has begun to both swing the bat and hit the ball hard, notably to the pull side and out of the stadium. He had four homers in five games going into the 2024 Subway Series regular-season finale Wednesday night.\n\nMcNeil was still only hitting .225 with an 84 OPS-plus. But can the Mets dream on him surging now to steadily offer impact to a lineup whose strength is the quality length even without McNeil? The Mets had eight players with at least 175 plate appearances and over a 100 OPS-plus and Jose Iglesias and Luis Torrens over 100 OPS-plus with 164 combined plate appearances?\n\nConversely, a Yankees weakness is the lack of length in their lineup, which LeMahieu has exacerbated with a .183 average and 45 OPS-plus, which was the lowest for a Yankee with at least 150 plate appearances since Stephen Drew's 39 in 2014. LeMahieu turned 36 this month and still does not appear to be able to generate consistent power after a couple of seasons wrecked by foot injuries.\n\nSo in the matchup of the former batting champs, it is currently advantage Mets.\n\nHow about:\n\nIt is currently no contest. Alonso was hoping to galvanize a perception like Aaron Judge -- the homegrown, power bastion beloved by a fan base. But it is Soto having a pre-free agency season in the conversation with Judge's historic 2022 walk year.\n\nAlonso was on pace for a 30- rather than a 40-homer season and his 122 OPS-plus was good, but also matched his career-low. He went into Wednesday with just two July homers. He continues to insist that the looming free agency and potential that his time in New York is dwindling is not impacting him.\n\nIf anything, New York is energizing Soto. He was on a 39-homer and 112-RBI pace, which would both be career-highs while again leading the league in walks. He has been durable and clutch and formed with Judge a 1-2 dynamism that has helped cover up a good deal of the ineptitude of the rest of the lineup. Advantage: Yankees.\n\nThe Mets were a season-low 11 games under .500 (24-35) through June 2. Boone's former bench coach, Mendoza, helped guide the Mets through the early doldrums and the best record in the majors (28-13) since. Not bad for a rookie manager.\n\nBoone had the Yankees an MLB-best 50-22 through June 14. But too often in Boone's now seven-year tenure this team takes a punch and it takes a long time (if ever) to recover. They were 10-21 since -- the majors' second-worst record in that time. Advantage: Mets.\n\nAlvarez went into the 2023 season ranked as the majors' third-best prospect by MLB.com. Volpe was fifth. Both were thought to have offensive games ahead of their defense, but both were better in the field than at the plate, where both hit .209 as rookies.\n\nBoth have continued to be strong on defense this season. Alvarez, due to a thumb injury, had been limited to 48 games through Tuesday. Durability has been an asset for Volpe, whose 907 \u00b9/\u2083 innings in the field were the most by any major leaguer this season.\n\nVolpe's offense has vacillated from on-the-rise to unplugged -- it was on the rise early in the season again. Alvarez has more power to give, but overall his offense has been strong. Because of the games played, the slight advantage goes to the Yankees.\n\nThat is the amount Scott Boras clients Brandon Nimmo (over eight years) and Carlos Rodon (over six years) signed for following the 2022 campaign. Nimmo has followed with a strong year-plus to date of rising power and familiar patience and late-in-the-career durability.\n\nRodon was a disaster in 2023. Positively, a lefty with an injury-ravaged history has made all of his starts and for the first eight weeks he was stellar. But his plummet before his last strong start mirrored that of the Yankees. He still feels like a guy learning to pitch rather than just throw. So in their mutual age-31 seasons for Nimmo and Rodon, it is advantage, Mets.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_LeMahieu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DJ LeMahieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gregory Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Torrens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Torrens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Iglesias_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Rod\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Rod\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Boras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-oo34zdai1-1721866350593.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721852037&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751676", "eventUri": "eng-9751676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 274, "textEnd": 281}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 2684, "textEnd": 2690}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 2906, "textEnd": 2913}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

At last.\n\n\"Had my wife come pick me up when it was convenient,\" Ottavino said at Yankee Stadium before the Subway Series opener Tuesday night. \"I was comfortable. I was happy.\"\n\nFollowing a 6-4 victory Monday night over the Marlins in the finale of a four-game series, the Mets got delayed flying out of Miami. They sat on the tarmac in South Florida for at least 2 1/2 hours, pitcher Luis Severino said, waiting as their plane was properly fueled.\n\n\"I don't know how long it takes to put gas in the plane, but it took a long time,\" he said.\n\nSeverino said the Mets took off after 2 a.m. They landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport about 4:45 a.m., then bused across Queens to Citi Field, where players jumped in their cars around 5:30 a.m. and fought rush-hour traffic as they drove home in daylight.\n\nFirst baseman Pete Alonso said he probably fell asleep at 7 a.m. or so.\n\n\"Yeah, the flight was nice,\" he said, tongue in cheek. \"We're good to go. We're ready to rock today.\n\n\"To be honest, it happens a lot. I mean, I know it's probably a story today because we're playing the Yankees,\" he added. \"But it happens way often more, but no one really cares because our job is to go out there and play regardless of the circumstances, and we're going to go out there and give it everything we've got. And there's really no excuses. We're all going to be ready to go. Pretty sure all of us have had at least eight hours of sleep, so we're ready to rock and roll.\"\n\nOttavino, however, said it was the latest (or earliest) he ever arrived back from a road trip on a game day during his 14 years in the majors.\n\n\"It wasn't fun. I wouldn't recommend it,\" the reliever said. \"I've landed with the sun up a bunch of times, but usually on an off day.\"\n\nOttavino didn't have his car at Citi Field, so rather than book a ride share home to suburban Westchester, he went to sleep at the ballpark for a while before his wife picked him up in the late morning and brought him home.\n\nOttavino said he felt \"dirty and gross\" so he showered first at the stadium. Hours later, he was in the Bronx getting ready for the crosstown-rival Yankees in a sleepy Mets clubhouse.\n\n\"That's part of what we do. Part of the life of a baseball player, baseball team. You know at some point throughout the year you're going to be facing things like that,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"We're here in the Bronx. Crowd's going to be electric. Important game.

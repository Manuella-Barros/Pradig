This month Nintendo of America announced plans to open an official store in San Francisco\u2019s Union Square, \u201cproviding a way for a wide range of visitors from near and far to experience the world of Nintendo, its products, and characters\u201d, the company said in a 'watch this space' announcement. The store, called Nintendo San Francisco, will open in 2025 as the second official location in the U.S., joining its debut store at the Rockefeller Center in New York City, which opened some 20 years ago. While Nintendo does also have some venues at U.S. theme parks, there are only three Nintendo stores outside of the U.S., all located in the company\u2019s native Japan, in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. Keeping its character cards close to its chest, Nintendo did not release any further details about the upcoming San Francisco store but the two-level New York store, which opened in 2005, includes Nintendo games and merchandise, hardware and accessories. The second floor is set out to display Nintendo consoles through the years.

Scott Wiener is set to debated next month, which if passed could make it legal to consume alcohol in downtown San Francisco by as soon as the end of this year. City officials hope that the new legislation could act as the catalyst for urban recovery after seeing similar laws in other states proving a success in helping to revitalize vacated downtowns. City officials want to make San Francisco the city that brought back partying. getty The proposal would see an entertainment zone on Front Street between California and Sacramento streets in the Financial District, a block that includes Harrington\u2019s Bar & Grill, the historic German beer hall and restaurant Schroeder\u2019s, with Senate Bill 76 permitting the creation of entertainment zones, city blocks where bars and restaurants can sell open-container alcoholic beverages for consumption. In January, Wiener extended the scope of the proposed legislation with a second bill, SB 969, that would enable the creation of entertainment zones in other California cities. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is expected to hold a hearing on SB 76 in June and the concept has the support of San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who said in putting forward the initiative: \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s Downtown is seeing a new surge of excitement, and we are thrilled to be the first city in California to take advantage of this new law to bring opportunities that foster joy for our residents, workers and visitors. As we continue to do the work, our goal is to encourage more fun and accessible outdoor community events. Our message is clear: San Francisco is having fun, thriving and open for business.\u201d Downtown Hit Post Pandemic The pandemic has hit visitor numbers in many downtowns nationwide, but nowhere more severely than San Francisco, which has seen retailers desert the city in droves, while Westfield handed back the keys to its city center mall. According to research from the University of Toronto, among Californian cities nearby San Jose has recovered the most foot traffic at 96%, Los Angeles has returned to 83%, but in the same timespan San Francisco has recovered just 67% of its foot traffic. To support activations in entertainment zones and throughout Downtown, Mayor Breed has also directed the Office of Economic and Workforce Development to partner with San Francisco New Deal to launch the Downtown ENRG (Entertainment & Nightlife Revitalization Grant) Program. The program that will offer up to $50,000 to fund new economic revitalization projects to support new activities, events, and campaigns to attract patrons and increase downtown activity.

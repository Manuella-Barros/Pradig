Bill also noted the fact that colleges keep raising tuition based on the fact that they know the government will keep supporting the loans.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Kelleyanne Conway was on the panel and she pointed out that this is nothing more than a political move to shore up votes.\n\nFOX News reported:\n\nMaher torches Biden's student loan handout: 'My tax dollars are supporting this Jew hating? I don't think so!'\n\n\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher took aim at President Biden's latest student loan handout proposal, insisting his own tax dollars, by extension, will be funding the \"Jew hating\" on college campuses.\n\nDuring Friday night's panel discussion, while discussing the anti-Israel unrest occurring at top universities in recent weeks, Maher said he gets \"so incensed\" at how many of the students participating receive federal aid.\n\n\"When I read about the college loans... 'Biden administration's student debt cancelation will cost a combined $870 billion to $1.4 trillion. That's a lot of debt forgiveness,\" Maher said.\n\nMaher continued, \"Colleges constantly raise tuition, then the kids take out more loans, then the government comes by and pays those loans. Okay, so my tax dollars are supporting this Jew hating? I don't think so.\"\n\nFox News contributor Kellyanne Conway said the student loan handout was unfair, telling Maher \"You can't have plumbers and pipefitters playing for the student loans of doctors and lawyers.\"\n\n\"I'm all for the government trying to help people who need it, but he did that as a political play and everybody knows it. He's bleeding young people support.\" Conway added.\n\nJoshua Greene of Bloomberg, who was also on the panel, noted that if the student loan debt forgiveness was meant to buy votes that it's not working. Young voters are still not supporting Biden by a margin that is comfortable for Democrats.\n\nIf you want to watch more of Kellyanne in the lion's den, this video includes talk about the 2024 election and other issues. In one interesting moment, Kellyanne talks about Trump Derangement Syndrome and Bill then proves that he absolutely still suffers from it.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_lachance@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "Mike LaChance", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Student debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Time with Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debt relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump derangement syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyanne_Conway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kellyanne Conway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bill-Maher-student-loan-debt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539620", "eventUri": "eng-9539620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

I don't think so.'\n\nLate night host Bill Maher slammed President Biden's student loan forgiveness scheme in a blistering attack, saying he sees it as 'supporting Jew hatred' amid anti-Israel protests on college campuses\n\nBiden's debt forgiveness plan is estimated to cost between $870 billion to $1.2 trillion, but was condemned as a 'political play' that hasn't paid off\n\nOn his HBO show 'Real Time with Bill Maher,' the comic noted that Biden's student debt forgiveness plan is estimated to cost between $870 billion to $1.2 trillion.\n\nThe White House redoubled its efforts again this week, announcing on Wednesday it cancelled $6 billion in debt for borrowers who attended the Art Institutes between 2004 and 2017.\n\nThat brought the total forgiveness so far to $160 billion for 4.6 million borrowers ahead of November's election.\n\nBiden's debt forgiveness drive is seen by some analysts as an attempt to turn the tide on his slumping poll numbers, particularly among young voters where Donald Trump has taken a surprising lead in several polls.\n\nIn November, Trump took his first lead over Biden among young voters in an NBC poll, where he led the incumbent 46 percent to 42 percent among voters aged 18-34.\n\nMaher and his guests, former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway and Bloomberg National Correspondent Joshua Green, agreed that they don't have high hopes for the debt forgiveness scheme to work for Biden.\n\n'You can't have plumbers and pipe fitters paying for the student loans of doctors and lawyers,' Conway said. 'It's not fair.\n\n'I'm all for the government trying to help people who need it, but he did that as a political play, and everyone knows it.'\n\nDisastrous polling news for President Joe Biden continues to pile up, as a new survey suggests that his predecessor, Donald Trump, is even beating him in the polls among voters under 35\n\nBiden's poll numbers have slumped among young voters, with his handling of the Israel-Hamas war seen as a key reason. Pictured: Student protestors on NYU campus on April 23, 2024\n\nGreen interjected that the tactic 'hasn't worked.'\n\n'If you look at issues young people care about, Gaza is like 15th out of 16, and the only thing that comes in lower than Gaza is student loan forgiveness,' he said.\n\n'So, it hasn't worked as a motivator for the youth vote, half of which are out there chanting \"Genocide Joe,\" so it's backfired not just in terms of public policy, but in terms of the politics too.'\n\nReferring to a recent CNN poll, Maher said: 'Yeah, I mean, Trump is winning the youth vote by I think 11 points, that's pretty astounding to me.'\n\nGreen said that this may be down to the media focusing on anti-Israel protests far more than issues that may be damaging to Republicans, such as Donald Trump's New York trial.\n\n'What I make of that a lot of it is if you turn on your TV today, you see young people protesting, angry, fighting with cops,' Green said.\n\n'All of these stories that could potentially be damaging for Republicans to help Joe Biden have fallen by the wayside because all of the attention is on these protesters and on these fights, on their behavior, and on the fact that a lot of people don't like what they see on the television.'\n\nMaher and his guests, former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway and Bloomberg National Correspondent Joshua Green, said they say Biden's student debt forgiveness plan won't reverse his poor polling\n\nHe noted that Biden was 'elected to push aside the chaos and the havoc of the Trump years', with Conway chiming in that Trump's chaos was 'in a tweet... now it's chaos and crisis everywhere we look.'\n\n'At the border, on our college campuses, by the way, in our halls of Congress, 31 Democrats voted against the resolution last October 18 to condemn Hezbollah and Hamas,' she said.\n\n'And the resolution clearly said, Bill, that they were concerned about institutions of higher education allowing sympathies for Hezbollah and Hamas, which our own government, Biden's government, Trump's government have declared terrorist groups.\n\n'They specifically said in there it was going to hurt, make uncomfortable, if not worse, Jewish students with all this antisemitism.\n\n'That was October 18!

That's a lot of debt forgiveness,\" explained Maher after the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the twelve- or thirteen-figure sum per Biden's giveaways.\n\n\"Okay, so colleges constantly raise tuition, then the kids take out more loans, then the government comes by and pays those loans,\" he detailed. \"Okay, so my tax dollars are supporting this Jew-hating?

I always like America and thought death to it was bad.\"\n\nThe following week, Maher predicted that the protests were going to make their way to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago over the summer and the left would be \"bloodied\" by chants of \"Genocide Joe.\"\n\nResponding to Maher's take, guests Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway and Bloomberg Businessweek national correspondent Joshua Green sounded off the seeming attempt to buy the vote of the youth vote.\n\n\"You can't have plumbers and pipefitters paying for the student loans of doctors and lawyers,\" argued Conway. \"I'm all for the government trying to help people who need it, but he did that as a political play and everybody knows it. He's bleeding young people support.\"\n\nAdding to that take, Green suggested it was a lost cause.\n\n\"And it hasn't worked.

And the only thing that comes in lower than Gaza is student loan forgiveness.\" he said. \"So it hasn't worked as a motivator for the youth vote, you know, half of which are out there changing 'Genocide Joe.'

Maher blasted the program and highlighted how it hasn't done anything to help the president in the polls.\n\nMaher's comments come amid widespread pro-Hamas protests being staged on college campuses.\n\nLate night host Bill Maher slammed President Biden's student loan forgiveness scheme as guests agreed the political ploy hasn't turned around his struggling poll numbers.\n\nThe comedian, 68, said the forgiveness plans are particularly offensive to him amid rampant anti-Israel protests occupying college campuses across the nation, as he sees them as 'supporting Jew hating.'\n\n'So, college's constantly raise tuition, then the kids take out more loans, then the government comes by and pays those loans,' he said.\n\n'So, my tax dollars are supporting this Jew hating? I don't think so.'\n\nThe president's loan forgiveness initiative comes with a hefty price tag that will be taken care of by the generosity of the American taxpayer.\n\nOn his HBO show 'Real Time with Bill Maher,' the comic noted that Biden's student debt forgiveness plan is estimated to cost between $870 billion to $1.2 trillion.\n\nThe White House redoubled its efforts again this week, announcing on Wednesday it cancelled $6 billion in debt for borrowers who attended the Art Institutes between 2004 and 2017.\n\nThat brought the total forgiveness so far to $160 billion for 4.6 million borrowers ahead of November's election.\n\nBiden's debt forgiveness drive is seen by some analysts as an attempt to turn the tide on his slumping poll numbers, particularly among young voters where Donald Trump has taken a surprising lead in several polls.\n\nThe debt forgiveness program was announced in April:\n\nOn Monday, Biden announced his new plan to forgive the student loan debt of roughly four million Americans. The plan will eliminate at least $5,000 for more than 10 million borrowers and will get rid of accrued interest for 23 million Americans, leaving American taxpayers on the hook for the majority of the bill. In total, through executive action, the Biden administration has canceled $146 billion in student loan debt. In an obviously strategic campaign move, Biden will travel to Madison, Wisconsin, a college town, to discuss the new plan. The scheme targets low and middle-income students, whose loans will be forgiven if they are enrolled in an \"income-driven repayment plan.\" Other categories of those with outstanding student loan debt include anyone who attended a \"low-value\" institution.\n\nMaher's panel guests, former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway and Bloomberg National Correspondent Joshua Green, also said the plan won't help Biden's chances of winning reelection. Conway asserted that the White House \"can't have plumbers and pipe fitters paying for the student loans of doctors and lawyers\" because \"it's not fair.\"\n\nGreen noted that among the issues prioritized by American voters, \"Gaza is like 15 out of 16, and the only thing that comes in lower than Gaza is student loan forgiveness.\"\n\nHe also observed that the program \"hasn't worked as a motivator for the youth vote, half of which are out there chanting 'Genocide Joe.'\"\n\nThe panel discussed how the program looks to the American public against the backdrop of the pro-Hamas protests on college campuses. Green pointed out that \"if you turn on your TV today, you see young people protesting, angry, fighting with cops.\"\n\nOthers have speculated that the nationwide protests are working against Biden's campaign while helping former President Donald Trump, who has capitalized on the antisemitic demonstrations to attack his opponent.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Time with Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Debt relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Student debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyanne_Conway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kellyanne Conway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2017/157/f493b821-3180-49f9-a4dd-7ab36a1d965b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539620", "eventUri": "eng-9539620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

I Mean, Really, Can You?", "body": "I was going to leave off writing disapproving pieces about Bill Maher. I'd written a few, provoked by his growing propensity for saying things the fascists really love to hear. Fox \"News\" now cherry picks Maher's comments, running snippets that give aid and comfort to the enemy. Not \"our\" enemy,\" mind you, but the enemy of all that is good, decent, thoughtful or sane in this country. On his most recent show, Kellyanne Conway was a guest and she wiped the floor with both the host and his other guest, Joshua Green, a limp-dicked liberal who made the late Alan Colmes (Sean Hannity's old liberal whipping boy) look fierce by comparison. Bill Maher agrees with Kellyanne on quite a few things. To his undying shame.\n\nTo be fair, there are things Bill Maher still says that are routinely kept from Fox viewers. But, as is increasingly the case, he once again gave up trying to suppress his inner-Fascist, unable to resist bitching about how the government is spending his tax money on people who hate Jews, by which he meant those students now protesting American policy toward Israel. So, Bill Maher, \"comedian,\" now transforms himself into the cliche of a fist-shaking old fart who builds arguments against damn near anything by first citing his onerous taxes.\n\nBy doing so, Maher engages in the most reckless of generalizations, repeating the toxically dangerous lie that all these hundreds of thousands of American students hate Jews even though no small number of them are, in fact, Jews themselves. The vast majority of the protesters aren't pissed off at Jews, per se. They are, as I am, righteously sickened by what Netanyahu (who just so happens to be the Jewish leader of Israel) has been doing since October of last year. Which, if it isn't merciless genocide, will have to do until the real thing comes along. No one should be labeled a \"Jew hater\" for being sickened by that. Common decency and morality demand that we be sickened by that. All of us. Not just students.\n\nI should have noticed that Mr. Maher was losing his way. He was, after all, the guy who notlong ago bowed down to Elon Musk, calling him a \"genius,\" fawning over him in ways approximating a pre-teen girl at an early Beatles concert. He's been indulging his love of sweeping generalizations for a long time, even the kind of hate speech they like so much over where Fox is their name and lies are their game. The headline Fox put out about this latest stupidity from Maher was that their newly acquired hero had \"torched\" Joe Biden. The Foxers love verbs like \"torched.\" They love it when anyone \"pummels,\" \"destroys,\" \"shreds,\" or \"trashes\" anyone or anything that carries even the faintest whiff of liberalism, let alone leftism. So, when a guy formerly associated with the left decides he is considering taking over where the late Rush Limbaugh left off, the folks at Fox eat that shit up.\n\nAnd shit it is. As someone who once was a student protester himself, I vividly recall how much was done to discredit student protesters. People were encouraged to believe that students who opposed the war hated our former high school classmates who were being sent to Vietnam to die. Maher, and far too many others, are old enough to remember that, too. Still, they want to conflate those who are now standing up and speaking out against merciless and indiscriminate killing of Palestinians as just a bunch of nasty Jew haters. Thus it is that people like Maher stand with the Speaker of the House Mike Johnson who went to Columbia University last week to scold protesting students, telling them to just go back to class and \"stop wasting your parents' money.\" It's so patronizing, so condescending, and truly so beside the point. It was precisely the sort of comment so often heard when students of my generation were a primary moral voice for America. It's a Foxy oversimplification to argue that being against the war is synonymous with being against American servicemen or our very country. Equally so, it's just plain stupid to assume that anyone who hates what Netanyahu has done, ipso facto, hates Jews.\n\nMaher has had a hard-on about young people ever since some college kids (theretofore the source of a lot of his income) spoke out against his well-paid campus gigs. He's been throwing a snit-fit about that damn near every time he opens his mouth. \"What's the matter with kids today?\" is at the top of his agenda, and in that, too, he perpetuates the stereotype of crabby old men. As with Trump, his constant whining about being treated worse than anyone has ever been treated before grows tiresome.\n\nSo. this very rich man, Bill Maher, whines about student loan forgiveness because he's a half-Jewish rich prick. Therefore, he reasons, student protesters and student loan recipients are Jew haters, and government money for them is coming out of his pocket. Poor fella. Here he is, a struggling comedian, just trying to get by while sitting atop a $140 million pile of accumulated wealth, and a yearly income of $10 million. And here comes the fuckin' government, squandering his tax money with freebies for student radicals and Hamas supporters.\n\nIt's so damn reactionary, so damn incendiary, and so fundamentally stupid that you'd almost think Maher had never gone to college himself. He did, though. He went to Cornell, though he probably didn't work his way through those school years.\n\nIt is, however, hard to square the kind of guy he used to be with the guy he has become as he so casually stereotypes all protesters as pretty much the same. Students bad. Government bad. Maher (and Kellyanne, at least on this subject) good. Pardon me if such thinking doesn't seem facile, even bigoted. It's somehow reminiscent of how the Nazis came to so successfully sell the idea that all Jews were the same. You know, vermin. It could never be that college students could be upset about the more than 34,000 dead Palestinians. No, pampered students they just decided to hate all Jews, everywhere because American college kids are pretty much known for being bigoted and anti-Semitic, right? And they're getting too much of Bill Maher's loot, though as a rich guy, he almost surely pays less as a percentage of income than less richly rewarded working Americans. Still, Maher doesn't seem bothered that a much bigger percentage of his tax returns are spent to provide limitless money and arms to Israel to use without constraint. With Biden and and the Democrats squandering his hard-earned take home pay on Jew haters, he might have to pick up a few more side hustles just to keep afloat.", "source": {"uri": "smirkingchimp.com",

However, he has no plans to end his HBO show, Real Time With Bill Maher, or his podcast.\n\n\"That leads me to something I feel nervous about telling you...

That's kind of an interesting option that people do nowadays. It's kind of an event.\"\n\nStill, despite telling Seinfeld he plans on being done, he admits that standup has been a significant part of his career and he might return to it. \"After 40 years, that's why I don't want to make an announcement like, 'This is my final...,'\" he said. \"I might change my mind.

The sky is blue.\" He went on to say that while he acknowledges that \"there's lots of poisons everywhere and lots of terrible things,\" he's realized with age that these are wonderful times. \"Trump could do this, and democracy, and blah, blah, blah -- nuclear war,\" he added, but \"I'm not gonna fucking go nuts a again, if he wins another term. I just can't.\"\n\n\"I'm not gonna lose my nervous system about Trump again,\" Maher added. \"If he ends the world, he is gonna end the world.\"\n\nInstead of pushing back, Seinfeld simply laughed along and indicated that he too is trying to stay even keeled about the prospect of Trump's return to office.\n\n\"Or you can get anxious like a millennial,\" Maher added.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Seinfeld said, before letting out a comical \"ugh\" when Maher brought up Gen Z.\n\nWhat Maher does not acknowledge is that he's probably experiencing the world a lot differently than Americans who aren't white, male, rich and famous -- the same people who are mostly likely to be adversely affected by a second Trump win. He had some choice words for his privileged buddies who acknowledge this, however.\n\n\"I had dinner with people and they're like, 'Oh, the world's ending,'\" he continued. \"Look around you, you fuck, you dumbass. We're at this fucking awesome restaurant, they're bringing you this food, this dinners gonna cost $700 and [you're not] even gonna fucking blink and pay the check.

Seinfeld likened being a parent to being a manager or an overseer, offering guidance when needed but overall allowing children to be left to their own devices.\n\nSeinfeld mostly declined to participate in any political discussions on the show, despite a few assertions by Maher regarding Trump and Biden.\n\nWhile discussing their age, Maher remarked how Seinfeld still looks \"generically middle aged\" and doesn't \"read old, like Biden.\"\n\n\"Biden reads old and Trump reads crazy, but not old. He reads just reads differently.\"\n\n\"Pretty much, well he's got a lot of makeup on, and the hair color and all that crap,\" Seinfeld added.\n\n\"I always say he's like KISS, he puts on the face paint and the wig and it's always 1976,\" Maher joked.\n\nEven though \"climate change is probably going to get us at some point,\" Maher continued, \"it hasn't yet.\"\n\n\"We walked out here today we weren't like, evaporated by the rays of the sun,\" and people should be thankful for living in the \"most f***ing amazing times,\" the comedian added.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seinfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Seinfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiss (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/i-just-can-t-maher-and-seinfeld-say-it-s-not-worth-it-to-go-nuts-again-if-trump-wins-in-2024.png?id=52179082&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C59", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539620", "eventUri": "eng-9539620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

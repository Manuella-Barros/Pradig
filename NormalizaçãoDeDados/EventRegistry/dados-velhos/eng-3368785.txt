But his key supporters hailed the decisions.\n\nK.P. Munusamy, a senior leader in the Panneerselvam faction, said their group had been demanding a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the then Chief Minister's death and keeping Sasikala and her family members out of the AIADMK.\n\nBut Munusamy wondered whether a judicial commission would deliver full justice.\n\n\"It seems the Chief Minister has started acting on his own only now,\" K.C.

"body": "In a major step closer to a merger of AIADMK factions, the Tamil Nadu government today announced a probe by a retired high court judge into the death of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa over which suspicions were raised by the rebel camp.\n\nAddressing a crowded press conference here, Chief Minister K Palaniswami also announced that the late AIADMK supremo's Poes Garden residence here, occupied by her till her hospitalisation last year, will be turned into a government- run memorial.\n\nThe twin announcements have virutally cleared the decks for the merger of the factions led by Palaniswami and rebel leader O Panneerselvam as they meet two of the key demands of the latter.\n\nPalaniswami said the inquiry had been ordered in the backdrop of views expressed by several persons regarding Jayalalithaa's death eight months ago.\n\n\"Various news from various sections and forums are appearing in the media about the death of Puratchi Thalaivi Amma (Revolutionary leader as Jayalalithaa was called by her followers).\n\n\"An inquiry commission headed by retired high court judge will be set up to look into the death of 'Idhaya Deivam' (God of heart) Amma,\" the chief minister said.\n\nAfter rebelling against the leadership of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala in February last, Panneerselvam, a former chief minister, had raised suspicions over the circumstances surrounding Jayalalithaa's death.\n\nWhile Panneerselvam demanded a probe, the matter also went to the Madras High Court where PILs had been filed by some persons seeking an inquiry and post-mortem.\n\nHowever, the Sasikala camp had been criticising Panneerselvam's demand, saying it was he who was the chief minister during Jayalalithaa's hospitalisation and would be among the first to be questioned in case of a probe.\n\nPalaniswami's announcements come days after his camp virtually nullified the appointment of T T V Dhinkaran as AIADMK deputy general secretary.\n\nIncidentally, Dhinakaran had only a few days ago at a public rally in Madurai made a demand for a probe into Jayalalithaa's death, seeking to take the wind out of Panneerselvam camp's sails.\n\nPalaniswami said Jayalalithaa had worked well with dexterity as Tamil Nadu's chief minister and brought laurels to the state.\n\nRecalling that Jayalalithaa was a six-time chief minister of Tamil Nadu who finds a space in \"everybody's heart,\" he said representations had been received to declare her Poes Garden residence \"Veda Nilayam,\" a memorial and allow it for public viewing.\n\n\"Veda Nilayam will be turned into a government memorial and the general public will be allowed to view it,\" he said, adding it would enable the people to know her achievements and sacrifices for the country.\n\nHe said the Commision would complete its work within an appropriate time frame and the name of the judge will be announced later.\n\nThe announcements have been made following representations from public and others and after due consideration by the government, the chief minister said.\n\nPanneerselvam loyalist and former Minister K P Munusamy welcomed the decision to make Poes Garden residence a memorial.\n\nOn the inquiry, he told PTI that they had actually demanded a CBI probe, though it was the chief minister's view to have a Commission of Inquiry.\n\nAsked if the prospects for merger have now brigthened, he said, \"as far as merger goes, it can happen only if Sasikala and her family are fully ousted (expelled) from the party.\"\n\nHe said the family, up to \"usurp,\" the party should be shown the door.\n\nTo a question, he said that even on the August 10 resolution which declared that Dhinakaran's appointment was against the party byelaws, the chief minister had not spoken adequately about Sasikala and on her expulsion.\n\nAIADMK leader P H Pandian, now Panneerselvam loyalist had raised several suspicions over Jayalalithaa's death in February.\n\nHe alleged that there was a quarrel at Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden home during which she was \"pushed down\" and collapsed.\n\nPandian, a former state assembly Speaker, said he suspected foul play, alleging that her demise occurred under \"unnatural\" circumstances and demanded a probe on her hospitalisation.\n\nJayalalithaa was admitted to Apollo hospital here on September 22 and passed away on December 5 after battling for 75 days.\n\nSeveral weeks after her death, the hospital held a press conference and asserted there was nothing suspicious about her demise and that she was given the right treatment.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Jayalalithaa died on December 5 last year after suffering a cardiac arrest at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai where she had been admitted on September 22 following complaints of fever and dehydration. There were reports alleging foul play behind the death of the AIADMK supremo.\n\nAdditionally, the chief minister has announced that Veda Nilayam, the Poes Garden residence of Jayalalithaa, will be turned into a memorial dedicated to her life and career.\n\nBoth the decisions were major demands raised by the AIADMK faction led by former CM O Panneerselvam ahead of the merger of the two groups, the other one led by Palaniswami. A factional war had broken out soon within the party after the death of Jayalalithaa and the subsequent elevation of Sasikala, her longtime aide, to the powerful general secretary post.\n\nHowever, standing in the way of the proposed merger of the two factions is TTV Dinakaran, the nephew of VK Sasikala who organised a massive rally in Melur village near Madurai. Dinakaran's rally was attended by 23 MLAs and 4 MPs of the ruling party and has the potential to spoil the merger of the two factions and even bring down the government. The ouster of Dinakaran and the family of Sasikala from the party is another condition put forward by the Panneerselvam faction for the merger to take place.\n\nIf the proposed merger happens, Palaniswami could continue as the chief minister with Panneerselvam taking charge as general secretary of the party and even assuming the role of deputy CM.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Jayalalithaa", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melur"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melur", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melur"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53036"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53276"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senthil_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "312224", "label": {"eng": "Senthil (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340160", "label": {"eng": "Vedas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

However, he revolted and Sasikala's conviction in disproportionate wealth case led to the chaos in the AIADMK. Later, the Election Commission of India froze the party's Two-Leaves symbol\n\nInitially, Palaniswami had cordial relationship with TTV Dhinakaran, who was appointed the deputy general secretary by Sasikala. However, after Dhinakaran contested the by-election to RK Nagar, the relationship started showing strains\n\nAfter the Election Commission postponed the by-election on April 10, the AIADMK (Amma) led by Palaniswami decided to keep away Sasikala family from party to pave way for merger. Meanwhile, Dhinakaran was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe the Election Commission officials\n\nWithin a few days of arrest of Dhinakaran, the AIADMK (Amma) formed a seven member committee to hold talks with AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) led by O Panneerselvam for holding merger talks. Panneerselvam also formed a committee\n\nEdappadi K Palaniswami took the first step last week by adopting a resolution declaring the appointment of Dhinakaran as invalid and now, again he took another step by fulfilling the key demand of O Panneerselvam, thus leaving the ball in his court to make the next move\n\nAn iconic residence from where Jaya faced ups and downs of life\n\nLate Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa had lived Veda Nilayam since 1972. The house warming ceremony took place on May 15, when she was a leading actor in Tamil film industry. Though AIADMK headquarters is near to her residence, Jayalalithaa took many an important political decision at this house and almost all important political leaders have visited this house.\n\nAll talks regarding alliance with political parties during the election time took place in this house only. For many years, VK Sasikala, her close aide also stayed in this house. She was arrested from this house in 1996 regarding the disproportionate wealth case. Normally, no many people can go inside this house and it remained fortress till her death. Only few close confidantes had access to this house. There is a small Vinayaka temple and whenever Jayalalithaa leaving the house, would offer obeisance to the Lord and while returning\n\nDeepa says she will take the govt to court over proposed memorial\n\nJ Deepa, niece of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, on Thursday took exception to the announcement by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami that the Poes Garden residence of the late AIADMK leader would be made a government memorial. \"I am surprised at the announcement. How can he make such an announcement without consulting us - the legal heirs of Jayalalithaa? Being the Chief Minister of the State, he should not have done that.\n\nWe will take legal action against this move,\" Deepa told medipersons. Deepa also charged that VK Sasikala was behind these announcements. \"This property was bought by Jayalalithaa's mother and as such it is our ancestral property. No one has the right to sell or transfer it,\" Deepa said. She also alleged that since the government headed by Palaniswami was on the verge of losing its majority, he was desperately trying to avoid it by making such announcements.\n\nProbe will put to rest unfounded speculations, says Apollo Hospitals\n\nWelcoming the probe announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on the death of chief minister J Jayalalithaa, the Apollo Hospitals, where she was treated, observed the probe would put to rest unfounded speculations. In a statement, the hospital management said, \"It is our greatest regret that despite highest standards of care provided, the late chief minister could not be saved.\n\nIt is our sincerest wish that finally the findings of the committee will put to rest all the unfounded speculations.\" It also expressed confidence that the inquiry commission would bring to light the outstanding treatment and care she received at the hospital, as well as from senior doctors and experts from Chennai, AIIMS, Delhi, UK, USA and Singapore. Jayalalithaa was admitted to the Apollo Hospitals on Greams Road here on September 22, 2016 and underwent treatment until she breathed her last on December 5.\n\nChief Minister has only accepted the demand TTV Dhinakaran made a few days ago. Through this enquiry, the blot on the family of VK Sasikala will be erased. But making the residence of Jayalalithaa a government memorial will only warrant legal issues because government has no right to do so\n\nP Vetrivel, MLA, supporter of TTV Dhinakaran\n\nThe ruling faction of the AIADMK is now under a severe political crisis and I see the inquiry commission announcement only in this angle. CPI demands that all property of Jayalalithaa should be taken over by the government\n\nCPI State secretary R Mutharasan\n\nInquiry Commission not necessary so many months after the death of Jayalalithaa. All doctors and leaders, including Edappadi K Palaniswami, should appear before the inquiry commission\n\nThanga Thamizh Selvan, a supporter of TTV Dhinakaran\n\nNo one can deny there are many doubts among the public regarding the death of Jayalalithaa. So the inquiry commission will clear the air. Also, declaring the residence of Jayalalithaa as government memorial is a good move. So we welcome the announcements\n\nThol Thirumavalavan, VCK president\n\nThe announcements are the reflection of the mind set of the people. I hope O Panneerselvam will accept this and come forward to work for the party together with us. Sasikala is in prison now. So no comments on her. She was elected by the general council and we have no power to remove her from the party position\n\nM Thambidurai, Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha\n\nSince there are suspicions about the death of Jayalalithaa prevailing among the AIADMK cadre, the enquiry commission is a welcome move. Besides, this will pave the way for the merger of the AIADMK factions\n\nH Raja, BJP national secretary\n\nIt is an eyewash and drama to facilitate the merger of both the corrupt factions (of the AIADMK). It is to deceive the people of Tamil Nadu. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami must order a CBI inquiry and resign from his position\n\nMK Stalin, working president, DMK\n\nI welcome both the announcements but former minister\n\nKP Munusamy has stressed a CBI probe. Why can't they order a CBI inquiry?\n\nS Thirunavukkarasar, president, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee\n\nThe announcements show that our two main demands have been fulfilled. Hereafter, open talks must be held for the merger\n\n'Ma Foi' K Pandiarajan, MLA\n\nWhat we have been seeking is a CBI probe.\n\nWe are not happy with the announcement of inquiry commission\n\nKP Munusamy, former minister\n\nThe Chief Minister has been denying the allegations of mystery surrounding the death of Jayalalithaa.

A retired high court judge will lead an inquiry commission and submit a report on her death, he said.\n\nHe also announced Jayalalithaa's residence Veda Nilayam at Poes Garden will be converted into a memorial.\n\nSignificantly, Palaniswami appears to be taking steps to heal the rift within the ruling party by trying to arrive at a middle ground.\n\nThe breakaway faction led by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam (OPS) had been demanding a CBI probe into the circumstances leading to the death of Jayalalithaa, who was also the general secretary of the AIADMK.\n\nThe OPS faction was also firm that VK Sasikala, who had taken over as the interim general secretary of the party, her nephew TTV Dhinakaran, whom she made deputy general secretary, and all her other family members should be removed from the party.\n\nIt also insisted that Sasikala and her relatives should not have any say in the running of the AIADMK.\n\nPalaniswami and his cabinet colleagues had earlier stated that Dhinakaran does not have a say in the party and had been sidelined.\n\nDhinakaran is on a State-wide tour, addressing public rallies to show his strength with the support of nearly 20 AIADMK MLAs and seven MPs.\n\nMa Foi K Pandiarajan, a key member of the OPS camp, was the first to react to Palaniswami's statement.\n\n\"Delighted to welcome two key moves by EPS to set up judicial enquiry into Amma's expiry and to convert Veda Nilayam into Memorial.

This step can be seen only as a move aimed at pleasing the BJP,\" DMK leader TKS Elangovan said.\n\nHe added that when the DMK sought a judicial probe, Palaniswami had rejected it but now it has acted because of \"pressure\" from the BJP to sideline Sasikala.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100, "id": 355, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "wgt": 100, "id": 1032, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327616", "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "328788", "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340160", "label": {"eng": "Vedas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

Sasikala as invalid.\n\nPanneerselvam had also wanted that Sasikala and her family members must be kept out of the party.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "wgt": 100, "id": 12, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Musculoskeletal_Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 802, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Musculoskeletal Disorders"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "wgt": 100, "id": 1101, "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Skin_Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 1240, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Skin Disorders"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327616", "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

Poes garden will be converted into a memorial for Amma: TN CM Palanisami pic.twitter.com/EJn8wUENsl\n\n-- News18 (@CNNnews18) August 17, 2017\n\nThe chief minister also said that Jayalalithaa's Poes garden bungalow will be converted into a memorial and will be open to the public.\n\n\"The government has decided to appoint a commission of inquiry headed by a retired judge to go into the death of Jayalalithaa as there have been several reports on the circumstances surrounding the death,\" the chief minister told the media at the Secretariat, accompanied by senior ministers, including state finance minister D Jayakumar.\n\nFile image of J Jayalalithaa. Reuters\n\nThe development comes just two days after ruling AIADMK (Amma) deputy chief TTV Dinakaran urged the Tamil Nadu government to order a probe into Jayalalithaa's death, The Hindu reported. Former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam had previously also demanded a probe into everything related to her death.\n\n\"Doubts persist about the medical treatment given to Amma. She fell ill suddenly and died. We want the government to probe everything related to her death, come out with the truth and put all doubts to rest,\" Panneerselvam had said.\n\nReferring to Panneerselvam's demand, Dhinakaran said that it was him and others who were in charge of the administration at the time of Jayalalithaa's death and if there is any probe, they should be inquired first. Panneerselvam was the caretaker chief minister of Tamil Nadu when Jayalalithaa was in the hospital. She died in Apollo hospital on 5 December last year after a prolonged illness.\n\nHowever, this move by the Palaniswamy camp is being seen as a step to placate the Paneerselvam camp in hopes of a merger of both the camps, India Today reported. The judicial probe and the memorial were part of the OPS section's demands for a merger.\n\nWith inputs from IANS\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 05:28 pm | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 05:28 pm\n\nTags :#Aiadmk#E palaniswamy#Newstracker#O panneerselvam#Ops#Poes garden#Tamil nadu#Ttv dinakaran", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100, "id": 355, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "314478", "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "328656", "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

The OPS faction has the support of the BJP and allies.\n\nThe Dinakaran faction has the blessings of jailed leader Sasikala. Meanwhile, there are talks of merger of Palaniswamy and OPS factions prompting Dinakaran to swing into action. And, he has chosen the birthday of Sasikala to play his cards today.\n\nTOP DEVELOPMENTS FROM TAMIL NADU POLITICSTTV Dinakaran today reached the Parappana Agrahara central prison in Bengaluru to meet Sasikala on her birthday. This comes a day after the Palaniswamy government agreed for judicial probe into former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's death.Sidelined AIADMK Amma deputy chief TTV Dinakaran's camp yesterday claimed victory over the probe ordered into Jayalalithaa's death, saying it had been done only after its leader made such a demand \"The announcement has come now only after a demand was made by our leader Dinakaran, it is welcome,\" Dinakaran's close loyalist and MLA P Vetrivel said.On August 14 at a rally in Madurai, Dinakaran had said that his family (including Sasikala) \"has nothing to hide, and nothing to fear..I am asking the government now to order a probe into the death of Jayalalithaa\".Vetrivel told PTI that some persons, including rebel leader O Panneerselvam, were making unfounded claims to lay the blame on \"Chinnamma (Sasikala) and her family,\" on matters related to Jayalalithaa's death and the best way to clear doubts was a Commission of Inquiry.Meanwhile, AIADMK faction led by O Panneerselvam also welcomed the probe into the death of Jayalalithaa. The OPS faction also said that transparent talks could be held for the party's unification.\"Victory for #OPS dharma yuddham! All 3 key demands by OPS met decisively! Time to transparently negotiate for merger! #UnitedAdmk,\" former minister and a leader of Panneerselvam faction Mafoi K Pandiarajan tweeted. However, another senior leader of the camp K P Munusamy said, \"As far as merger goes, it can happen only if (party chief) V K Sasikala and her family are fully ousted (expelled) from the party\".As preconditions for merger talks, the Panneerselvam camp has demanded a probe into the death of Jayalalithaa, conversion of her Poes Garden residence into a memorial and removal of jailed Sasikala and her family members from the AIADMK.In a related development, Veda Nilayam, the sprawling bungalow located at the upscale Poes Garden area of Chennai where J Jayalalithaa stayed for over three decades, is set to become a memorial. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami's announcement, made yesterday, has been welcomed by those who had taken exception to Jayalalithaa's close aide V K Sasikala's decision to stay put there. The bungalow was occupied by Jayalalithaa till her hospitalisation in September last year along with Sasikala.Prior to Jayalalithaa's burial, her body was brought from the hospital to the Poes Garden residence and kept there briefly before being taken to the Rajaji Hall for public homage. Sasikala, who took over the party reins after the death of Jayalalithaa in December last year, continued to live there amid murmurs of protest by sections of her partymen.The 10 ground (approx 24,000 square feet) bungalow was bought by Jayalalithaa and her mother Veda in 1967. According to her affidavit filed for last year assembly elections, Jayalalithaa and her mother Veda had purchased the property on July 15, 1967 at a cost of Rs 1.32 lakh and its value last year was estimated at Rs 72.09 crore. 'Veda' is the name of Jayalalithaa's mother, who was known as Sandhya in the Tamil film world. Jayalalithaa's nephew Deepak Jayakumar has claimed to have the will proving his legal rights to inherit the bungalow.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nALSO READ |\n\nTamil Nadu: Will there be a new no-confidence motion against Palaniswami's AIADMK government?\n\nALSO WATCH: SO SORRY | How Modi-Shah duo make BJP's lotus bloom in Tamil Nadu", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 273, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53276"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55338"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungalow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "317175", "label": {"eng": "Bungalow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326288", "label": {"eng": "Urban sprawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340160", "label": {"eng": "Vedas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

A probe into the former Chief Minister's death was a key demand of the AIADMK faction headed by O Panneerselvam.\n\nPalaniswami, who is heading the other faction, also accepted the demand of the OPS camp to convert Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence in Chennai into a government-run memorial.\n\nSources in the OPS camp expressed satisfaction at the decisions, but maintained that a merger could only take place after the complete ouster of V S Sasikala from the party. Palaniswami's announcements indicated that the talks between the EPS and OPS factions -- which broke down and were revived several times in the last few months -- were progressing well.\n\n\"Various news from various sections and forums are appearing in the media about the death of Puratchi Thalaivi Amma.... An inquiry commission headed by a retired high court judge will be set up to look into the death of Idhaya Deivam (god of heart) Amma,\" the CM said. He added that Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence \"Veda Nilayam will be turned into a government memorial and the general public will be allowed entry\".\n\nAfter rebelling against the leadership of Sasikala in February, Panneerselvam had raised suspicion over the circumstances of Jayalalithaa's death. His camp had demanded a CBI probe into the matter. On Thursday, however, they welcomed the probe announcement. Senior leaders like K P Munusamy, though, said the merger between the AIADMK factions could happen only when Sasikala and her family are fully ousted from the party.\n\nSasikala's nephew T T V Dinakaran, who both factions want ousted, had surprisingly demanded a judicial probe into Jayalalithaa's death. On Thursday, leaders close to him claimed credit for the announcement of the probe. \"The announcement has come only after a demand was made by our leader Dinakaran, it is welcome,\" Dinakaran loyalist and MLA P Vetrivel said.\n\nThe EPS faction has already passed a resolution declaring that the appointment of Dinakaran as the party's deputy general secretary is not acceptable. The OPS camp, however, wants complete ejection of the family. It has also approached the Election Commission demanding that the posts of Sasikala and Dinakaran be declared invalid in the AIADMK.\n\nThe Opposition DMK, meanwhile, described the probe as an eyewash and asked the Tamil Nadu government to order a CBI probe if it was truly interested in unravelling the matter. DMK working president M K Stalin also demanded the resignation of the CM and his Cabinet to facilitate a fair probe by the CBI. Senior DMK leader and Rajya Sabha MP T K S Elangovan said the probe was aimed at easing out Sasikala and her family from politics.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: E K Palaniswami J Jayalalithaa", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups", "wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100, "id": 355, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327616", "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "328788", "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "352585", "label": {"eng": "M.

Palaniswami announcing that a judicial probe will be conducted into the death of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, who had died mysteriously in a Chennai hospital on December 5 last year. After Jayalalithaa's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 V.K. Sasikala's nephew T.T.V. Dinakaran was ousted from the post of deputy general secretary of the party recently, a high powered probe into the iconic Jayalalithaa's death was one of the main unfulfilled demands of O. Panneerselvam, the leader of the other faction, that was holding up the merger.\n\nIt has been no secret that the BJP, especially Prime Minister Modi, has been keen on the merger of the two factions of AIADMK and without saying so explicitly also for a probe into Jayalalithaa's death in the wake of suspicions that Sasikala and her extended family may have had a role in Jayalalithaa's death. Palaniswami had been resisting this demand for probe so far and was dragging his feet on another demand of Jayalalithaa's close associate and her minister of finance Panneerselvam to divest Sasikala of the charge of being the party's general secretary.\n\nBy now ordering a probe by a retired High Court judge, Palaniswami has indeed killed two birds with one stone -- clearing the decks for a merger of the Panneerselvam faction with his own thereby also appeasing Modi, and of appropriating Jayalalithaa's political legacy. Also, by accepting the demand for converting the Poes Garden residence of the former chief minister into a memorial for Jayalalithaa, Palaniswami has earned kudos all around and held out a strong rebuff to Sasikala who, though in jail convicted in a disproportionate assets case, has been in remote control of the premises where she lived with Jayalalithaa when the latter was in power.\n\nNow, it goes without saying that even if the party general secretary's post is not wrested from Sasikala her continuance would be meaningless as she has been shorn of all authority. Dinakaran, who has her blessings, will use his considerable money power to get some legislators on their side but considering how down and out Sasikala and he would be, there would at best be a handful of supporters to stand with them.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

According to the will, the Poes Garden residence had been bequeathed to Jayalalithaa by her mother.\n\nIndia Today has accessed the will of Jayalalithaa's mother, according to which Poes Garden belongs to Amma. While the Poes Garden residence had been left for Amma, Jayalalithaa's brother was given a house in T Nagar.\n\nJayalalithaa's will, however, is yet to surface. Nobody has a clue whether Jayalalithaa actually left a will. In its absence, her niece and nephew Deepa and Deepak Jayakumar seem to be the legal heirs as they are Amma's closest living relatives.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu government had announced that Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence will be converted into a memorial.\n\nArmed with the old will copy, Deepak and Deepa have decided to approach the court.\n\nDeepak, son of Jayalalithaa's brother Jayakumar, told India Today, \"Will you allow your house to be converted into a memorial ? I will not allow my house to be converted into a memorial. I have the documents to prove. I will approach the court.\"\n\nDeepak has written a letter to Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy. Deepa Madhavan has also planned to approach the court.\n\nSandhya, who was also an actress, left the handwritten will in her hospital bed before her death. In her will, she left her Natya Kala Niketan controlling the properties. Jayalalithaa is the partner of Natya Kala Niketan which controls Poes Garden residence.\n\nThe T Nagar residence of Sandhya was left to her son Jayakumar whose children are Deepa and Deepak.\n\nSudha Ramalingam, advocate says, \"This is her mother's will. Now that there is no will by Jayalalithaa, it can go to second class legal heirs. If the government wants to set up memorial they have to acquire the will from the legal heir and then compensate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, TTV Dhinakaran said that the decision of declaring the Poes Garden residence as memorial is for \"the personal interest of few persons\".\n\nMeanwhile, talks of merger between the EPS and OPS camps of the AIADMK are likely anytime today.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nEndgame near for Sasikala, Dinakaran as Palaniswami orders judicial probe into Jayalalithaa death\n\nJudicial probe into Jayalalithaa's death funny, says forum run by Amma's niece Deepa\n\nAfter announcement of probe into Jayalalithaa's death, it's match point Palaniswami in Tamil Nadu's game of thrones\n\nWATCH | Jayalalithaa's nephew asks EPS to seek his consent before deciding on Poes Garden", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314478", "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Nagar", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

Panneerselvam said on Thursday.\n\n\"The inquiry commission should study and probe five years medical records of Jayalalithaa and the kind of treatment given to her.

The AIADMK then broke up into factions.\n\nThe pro-Panneerselvam Palaniswami said the next step towards a merger of the two factions was calling a General Council meeting and declaring the appointment of the now jailed General Secretary V.K.

After the new Chief Minister K Palaniswami announced yesterday that his government would appoint a commission of inquiry to probe the death of Jayalalithaa and convert her 'Veda Nilayam' residence into a memorial, a new controversy started. Jayalalithaa's niece J Deepa has opposed the Tamil Nadu government's plans to convert her aunt's residence here into a memorial, saying she would take legal steps against it. In case you are wondering why there is so much fight over one house, you should know these 10 mind-blowing facts about Poes Garden:\n\n1. Poes Garden which was Jayalalithaa's home was purchased by her mother Vedavalli whose screen name was Sandhya in 1967 for a reported cost of Rs 1.32 lakh.\n\n2. Number 81, Veda Nilayam, Poes Garden was the most renowned address in Tamil Nadu over the past 3 decades.\n\n3. The former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa was living in Poes Garden for last 35 years until she passed away last year.\n\n4. Today, the value of this property stands at Rs 90 crores, according to a report by India.com.\n\n5. However, in her election affidavit, Jayalalithaa stated the value of Poes Garden as Rs 43.96 crores.\n\n6. The house is so big that its total carpet area is 24,000 square feet.\n\n7. Since Jayalalithaa passed away, there has been no clear inheritor of Poes Garden.\n\n8. On paper, the house is owned by late Jayalalithaa. But, since she had no child, the property could not be naturally transferred.\n\n9. Interestingly, AIADMK General Secretary Sasikala who is currently in jail lived at the Poes Garden along with Jayalalithaa.\n\n10. However, after being informed about some alleged conspiracies being hatched against her by Sasikala's family members, Jayalalithaa suspended her loyalist from the home in 2012. Sasikala was invited back to Poes Garden by Jayalalithaa after some time.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "401176", "label": {"eng": "Rajani"}}]}

Sasikala, who is currently serving a sentence in a corruption case, had handed over reins of the party to nephew Dinakaran just after her conviction.\n\nPanneerselvam has been demanding a CBI probe into the \"mysterious death\" of Jaya, or Amma to millions. OPS has long maintained that he or his supporters were not allowed to see Jayalalithaa in the hospital though they had stayed put at the hospital all along the 75-day stay. The Sasikala camp did not even listen to suggestions that Jayalalithaa should be taken to the UK or the US for treatment, OPS had claimed.\n\nHe had also rejected the treatment summary released by the state government in March, which said that the team of doctors had battled in vain to save Jayalalithaa, but she had died of cardiac arrest.\n\nEver since her death, there have been allegations of foul play.

Jayalalitha, over which suspicions were raised by a rebel ruling party camp.\n\nAddressing a crowded press conference here, Chief Minister K. Palaniswami also announced that the late AIADMK supremo's Poes Garden residence here, occupied by her until her hospitalisation last year, will be turned into a government- run memorial.\n\nThe twin announcements have virtually cleared the decks for the merger of the factions led by Palaniswami and rebel leader O. Panneerselvam as they meet two of the key demands of the latter.\n\nPalaniswami said the inquiry had been ordered in the backdrop of views expressed by several persons regarding Jayalalitha's death eight months ago.\n\n\"Various news from various sections and forums are appearing in the media about the death of Puratchi Thalaivi Amma (Revolutionary leader as Jayalalitha was called by her followers).\n\n\"An inquiry commission headed by retired high court judge will be set up to look into the death of ... Amma,\" the chief minister said.\n\nAfter rebelling against the leadership of AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala in February last, Panneerselvam, a former chief minister, had raised suspicions over the circumstances surrounding Jayalalitha's death.\n\nWhile Panneerselvam demanded a probe, the matter also went to the Madras High Court where PILs had been filed by some persons seeking an inquiry and post-mortem.\n\nHowever, the Sasikala camp had been criticising Panneerselvam's demand, saying it was he who was the chief minister during Jayalalitha's hospitalisation and would be among the first to be questioned in case of a probe.\n\nPalaniswami's announcements come days after his camp virtually nullified the appointment of T.T.V. Dhinkaran as AIADMK deputy general secretary.\n\nIncidentally, Dhinakaran had only a few days ago at a public rally in Madurai made a demand for a probe into Jayalalitha's death, seeking to take the wind out of Panneerselvam camp's sails.\n\nPalaniswami said Jayalalitha had worked well with dexterity as Tamil Nadu's chief minister and brought laurels to the state.\n\nRecalling that Jayalalitha was a six-time chief minister of Tamil Nadu who finds a space in \"everybody's heart,\" he said representations had been received to declare her Poes Garden residence \"Veda Nilayam,\" a memorial and allow it for public viewing.\n\n\"Veda Nilayam will be turned into a government memorial and the general public will be allowed to view it,\" he said, adding it would enable the people to know her achievements and sacrifices for the country.\n\nHe said the Commision would complete its work within an appropriate time frame and the name of the judge will be announced later.\n\nThe announcements have been made following representations from public and others and after due consideration by the government, the chief minister said.\n\nPanneerselvam loyalist and former Minister K P Munusamy welcomed the decision to make Poes Garden residence a memorial.\n\nOn the inquiry, he told PTI that they had actually demanded a CBI probe, though it was the chief minister's view to have a Commission of Inquiry.\n\nAsked if the prospects for merger have now brightened, he said, \"as far as merger goes, it can happen only if Sasikala and her family are fully ousted (expelled) from the party.\"\n\nHe said the family, up to \"usurp,\" the party should be shown the door.\n\nTo a question, he said that even on the August 10 resolution which declared that Dhinakaran's appointment was against the party bylaws, the chief minister had not spoken adequately about Sasikala and on her expulsion.\n\nAIADMK leader P.H. Pandian, now Panneerselvam loyalist had raised several suspicions over Jayalalitha's death in February.\n\nHe alleged that there was a quarrel at Jayalalitha's Poes Garden home during which she was \"pushed down\" and collapsed.\n\nPandian, a former state assembly Speaker, said he suspected foul play, alleging that her demise occurred under \"unnatural\" circumstances and demanded a probe on her hospitalisation.\n\nJayalalitha was admitted to Apollo hospital here on September 22 and passed away on December 5 after battling for 75 days.\n\nSeveral weeks after her death, the hospital held a press conference and asserted there was nothing suspicious about her demise and that she was given the right treatment.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53276"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340160", "label": {"eng": "Vedas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_High_Court", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "348663", "label": {"eng": "Madras High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandyan_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "354965", "label": {"eng": "Pandyan Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

He said it was unlike the 1989 unification of the party led by late J Jayalalithaa \"which was natural\". The AIADMK had split following the demise of founder leader M G Ramachandran in 1987. The two factions at present are led by Chief Minister K Palaniswami and rebel leader and former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam.\n\nDhinakaran alleged \"they (Palaniswami and Panneerselvam) are doing it for their self-interest to protect their position...that will not have longevity\". He said the merger would not last long if it was done to \"safeguard their posts, like a business agreement, leaving away cadres, out of selfishness\". Dhinakaran said when the party merged under the leadership of Jayalalithaa in 1989, it was done in the interests of cadres. However, now the proposed merger move was not in the cadres' interests, he claimed, adding that their interests were now \"different\".\n\nThe prospects of merger of the factions had brightened after the state government yesterday announced a probe by a retired high court judge into the death of Jayalalithaa, over which suspicions were raised by the rebel camp. Palaniswami also announced that Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence here would be turned into a government-run memorial, two key demands of the OPS faction. To a question related to MLAs supporting him, Dhinakaran said several MLAs had come (to his side) and \"more legislators are there like a sleeper cell...I cannot spell out the strategy. If warranted, we will prove our strength.\" Dhinakaran said he met Sasikala and held \"consultations\".\n\n\"You will see further moves...operation,\" he said adding, his faction would only implement the wishes of party workers.\n\nTo a question on the Tamil Nadu government ordering a probe into the death of Jayalalithaa, he said he had demanded it on behalf of Sasikala at the recent Madurai rally against the background of questions raised about her passing away. Also, he had made the demand as it would make it clear that Sasikala was \"as clean as pure gold\" on the issue. On the government's decision to turn into a government- run memorial the late AIADMK supremo's residence here, he said, \"There is nothing wrong in making Amma's residence a memorial.\"\n\nHe said if it had been done in sync with the aspirations of the people and cadres, they should have considered if there was any will left behind by Jayalalithaa. Also, Dhinakaran said the government should have spoken about \"legalities,\" an apparent reference to her niece Deepa and nephew Deepak. However, \"doing it in haste, out of selfishness, to retain their posts will not be proper and the government should go ahead in a proper manner\" in this issue, he said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 273, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "wgt": 100, "id": 469, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53276"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303300", "label": {"eng": "Clandestine cell system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

Palaniswami on Thursday announced a Commission of Inquiry to go into the death of Jayalalithaa and also said her Poes Garden residence would be turned into a memorial, thus meeting two of the prime conditions for merger set by the rival faction led by O. Panneerselvam.\n\nThe inquiry, announced eight months after the former CM's demise at the end of 75 days of battle with multiple ailments at the Apollo Hospital, will be headed by a retired judge of the Madras High Court. The judge's name would be announced later, Chief Minister Palaniswami said, recalling that the media had reported \"all kinds of statements from various people and organisations\" regarding Jayalalithaa's death.\n\nThe 68-year-old former chief minister died following cardiac arrest on December 5, plunging her followers into a state of despair and sorrow, and the state politics into a cauldron of near-chaos.\n\nHailing Jayalalithaa as a great leader who had toiled for the welfare of the state and its people, CM Palaniswami said her 'Veda Nilayam' residence would be made a memorial in deference to the requests from several quarters. \"Amma's residence will be turned into a government memorial, where the public can learn about her various achievements and sacrifices\", said the Chief Minister, flanked by senior cabinet colleagues, finance minister D. Jayakumar, forest minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan and power minister P. Thangamani at the crowded press conference at the Secretariat.\n\nJust a while after the CM's announcement of the probe into Jayalalithaa's death, the OPS camp's main spokesman K.P.Munusami expressed dissatisfaction saying only a CBI probe would bring out the truth. \"We have been all along demanding a CBI investigation\", he said, adding that the decision to covert 'Veda Nilayam' into a memorial was \"most welcome\".\n\nIt was certainly not welcome for Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa, who held a press conference at her T'Nagar residence and declared she would fight the CM's decision \"right up to the Supreme Court\". \"He could have at least discussed it with me, since I am a legal heir (along with brother Deepak), before making this announcement. Besides, he has no authority to convert my aunt's residence into a state memorial\", fumed Deepa, one of the byproducts of the post-Jaya chaos.\n\n\"As her niece and heir, I have been planning to preserve for posterity my aunt's great achievements and fame, in a fitting manner. Only I have the responsibility to take to the people her life and legacy\", she said.\n\nIf the CM's camp was disheartened by Munusami's dismissive response and Deepa's challenge, there was some solace from another OPS camper, former minister Mafoi Pandiarajan. \"Victory for OPS dharma-yudham. All three key demands by OPS met decisively. Time to transparently negotiate for merger\", tweeted \"delighted\" Pandiarajan.\n\nThe \"three key demands\" conceded by the EPS faction include the resolution it passed on August 8 saying that no one is qualified for the position of party general secretary held by the great Amma - which in effect meant that Sasikala chosen as the 'interim' general secretary has served her time once the Supreme Court sent her to the Parappana Agrahara jail in Bengaluru. That resolution had also ejected her nephew TTV Dhinakaran from the post of deputy general secretary; which effectively addressed the key OPS demand that the 'family' should be kept out of the AIADMK.\n\nNow that everything, or nearly everything, appears sorted out, it remains to be seen when the merger moves that seemed slowing down of late, will pick up pace.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dindigul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dindigul", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dindigul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54590"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55338"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310465", "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327616", "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_High_Court", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "348663", "label": {"eng": "Madras High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

Both Deepa and Deepak have been constantly trying to cement themselves as Amma's true heir after Jayalalithaa's death. She had also tried to stake claim over Amma's assets.\n\nRecently, Deepa and her supporters had staged a protest outside Poes Garden, alleging that she was assaulted and denied entry into the residence by the supporters of TTV Dhinakaran. Incidentally, her brother Deepak was present in the house when she arrived. Poes Garden, which is unoccupied now was thrown open to the public for a\n\nwhile earlier this year, but was soon closed down.\n\nApart from turning the house into a memorial open for public, the Tamil Nadu government also announced a commission that would re-investigate the death of Jayalalithaa. Both the announcements were major demands raised by OPS and his supporters and come amid the reports of a proposed merger between two AIADMK factions led by Panneerselvam and Palaniswami. OPS had also launched a signature campaign to turn Veda Nilayam into a memorial, which received a good response from the public.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Deepa Jayakumar J Jayalalithaa Tamil Nadu", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100, "id": 355, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324433", "label": {"eng": "Government of Tamil Nadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340160", "label": {"eng": "Vedas"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edappadi", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edappadi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "763494"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinakaran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "986899", "label": {"eng": "Dinakaran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disproportionate_Asset_case_against_Jayalalithaa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1305656", "label": {"eng": "Disproportionate Asset case against Jayalalithaa"}}]}

He said the house belonged to him and his sister.\n\nOn Thursday, the Chief Minister announced a judicial probe into Jayalalithaa's death in December and said the house where she lived for years would be converted into a memorial which would be open to the public.\n\n--IANS\n\nvj/mr/rn\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100, "id": 404, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305741", "label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Tamil_Nadu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "396541", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu"}}]}

today to chalk out the future course of action, a day after the Tamil Nadu government announced a probe into the death of J Jayalalithaa.\n\nWhile Chief Minister K Palaniswami was closeted with his Cabinet colleagues to deliberate on the matter, the rival camp led by O Panneerselvam held its own meeting here.\n\nThe meeting held at the residence of Panneerselvam, a former chief minister, was attended by the top leaders of his camp, including former ministers K P Munusamy, K Panidarajan, besides MLAs, MPs and other office-bearers.\n\nPanneerselvam, who has the support of about 10 MLAs and a dozen MPs, is expected to formally respond to Palaniswamy's announcement on setting up of an inquiry commission to probe Jayalalithaa's death and conversion of her Poes Garden home into a memorial, two key demands of his faction for the merger.\n\nThe formal expulsion of jailed party general secretary V K Sasikala and her kin, including deputy general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, from the AIADMK was the other major demand.\n\nWhile the Palaniswami camp has \"delegitimised\" Dhinakaran's post, it was maintaining that Sasikala's appointment was hanging in balance as the matter was pending with the Election Commission and the court.\n\nThough the Panneerselvam faction had sought \"either a CBI or a judicial probe,\" in March, some of its leaders now claim that the demand was for only a CBI investigation.\n\nAgainst this background, the meeting chaired by the chief minister is deliberating on various issues raised by the OPS faction.\n\nSimultaneously, supporters of Dhinakaran are holding consultations at a city hotel even as he met his aunt Sasikala in a Bengaluru prison earlier in the day along with his family.\n\nThe supporters also held functions to celebrate the Sasikala's birthday today by disbursing welfare assistance.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday announced his government's resolve to convert her house into a memorial, yielding to the demands of many party workers and leaders, including some from opposition parties.\n\nJayalalithaa and her mother Sandhya acquired the property way back in 1967, two years after her debut in a Tamil movie, for Rs 1.32 lakh. The 24,000 sq ft house, now valued at Rs 90 crore by realtors, was witness to many political developments as she made and marred alliances in her drawing rooms.\n\nMany coveted occupying and possessing this VIP address. The house became a bone of contention after Jayalalithaa's death when her confidante V K Sasikala chose to stay put there to give wings to her political ambitions, claiming to be Jayalalithaa's political heir. It ended only with her imprisonment in the disproportionate assets case in February this year.\n\nJayalalithaa's two legal heirs did not give up either. Dipak, her nephew, got close to the Mannargudi family and managed access to the house too. Jayalalithaa's niece, Deepa, meanwhile, has been waging a war of attrition with her own brother (Dipak) and the Sasikala family, claiming to be the rightful owner of the house.\n\nVeda Nilayam, apart from other things, boasts of housing a private library of its erstwhile owner, who was a voracious reader. Jayalalithaa's reading habit dates back to her acting days. She used to read books during breaks at shooting venues.\n\nJayalalithaa had a fine collection of designer teak furniture, which she nurtured with passion. Once she lost her cool during a press briefing when a journalist, jostling for space in her drawing room, sat on the handrest of a teak sofa. On another occasion in 2003, she did not mind a couple of journalists covering her press meet standing on one of the teapoys, because she had just won the Tansi case and had no reasons to feel bad about anything.\n\nLegal experts are of the opinion that if Deepa and Dipak stake claim to the property as legal heirs of Jayalalithaa, the government will have to pay them compensation. Nothing, however, can stand in the way of government acquiring the property, especially for a public cause.\n\nThe clamour to convert it into a memorial started within days of Jayalalithaa's death and TOI was the first to report it. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukkarasar, a one-time party colleague of Jayalalithaa, was the first to raise the demand for a memorial in keeping with her stature as a mass leader, citing that Jayalalithaa had not left behind a will.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "wgt": 100, "id": 737, "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mannargudi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannargudi", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mannargudi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53113"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "347010", "label": {"eng": "Teak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "390521", "label": {"eng": "Tamil cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "401176", "label": {"eng": "Rajani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirunavukkarasar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "696539", "label": {"eng": "Appar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disproportionate_Asset_case_against_Jayalalithaa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1305656", "label": {"eng": "Disproportionate Asset case against Jayalalithaa"}}]}

Palaniswami's sudden announcement that a commission of inquiry would be constituted to examine the circumstances leading to the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\n\nShe alleged that the Sasikala family was actually behind the move. In a press conference at her residence on Thursday evening, she said the decision to probe the death at this stage was made as he was under pressure to prove his government's majority.\n\nThe announcement had been made in a hurry and was just an eye-wash. On the government's proposal to convert Veda Nilayam, her aunt's residence in to a memorial, she said: \"I have and will definitely take legal steps regarding this. This kind of statement being made by the Chief Minister in his official capacity has come as a surprise. There is no doubt that Sasikala's family is behind this move.\"\n\nShe further said: \"For madam Jayalalithaa, the only legal heirs are myself and my brother Deepak. We have not been consulted and they have no legal right to make this announcement without consulting us.\"\n\nOn whether she had legal documents to her property, she said, \"Veda Nilayam is my paternal grandmother Sandhya's property. It is our ancestral property. It cannot be legally sold or bought by anyone else. It is our moral, legal and ethical right,\" she said.\n\nUntil recently, Mr. Palaniswami had been maintaining that Sasikala was the political heir and he had even fallen at her feet. Now, he has suddenly changed tune and was demanding a judicial inquiry.\n\nThe party leaders and the government were unable to find solutions to the problems faced by the State and instead resorting to empty statements, she added.\n\nOn the former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam's statement that both his demands had been met, she said he had no clarity of thought or explanation. \"He called me and declared that I was the heir. He then retracted his statements several times. He is also interested only in position and taking over the party. His statements and movement has only reiterated that the Sasikala family is behind this move too,\" Ms. Deepa said.\n\n\"I had raised my voice that as a blood relative I had not been allowed to visit my aunt and made to stand outside Apollo Hospitals for 75 days. There was no acknowledgement of all that I underwent but now the two factions have brought the fight to the streets and are destroying the party. They are also erasing the name and fame Amma had earned. It is a vile drama enacted for political gain,\" she said.\n\nShe said any judicial inquiry will not be complete without her participation and cooperation.

Observers say the announcement reveals an intention in the EPS camp to up the ante against VK Sasikala's nephew who, emboldened by the support at Melur, had gone on to issue warnings to the ruling faction of the AIADMK to \"mend its ways\". \"I see this purely as a response to Dhinakaran's speaking in Melur that he welcomes a probe,\" said Gnani Sankaran, a political observer. \"Secondly, a probe, as we all know, will bring into question the people who were in the thick of things at Veda Nilayam and the hospital, both locations where Edappadi Palaniswami had very little role,\" he said.\n\nMinutes after the announcement, BJP's national secretary H Raja wrote on Twitter that a merger between warring factions of the AIADMK was imminent.\n\nSenior proponents in the camp of rebel leader O Panneerselvam, however, said their demands of a CBI probe into the death of the former chief minister and complete ba nishment of the VK Sasikala clan have not been met.\n\nFrom the OPS dugout emerged reactions of elation that the EPS camp was finally responding to their demands, but conflicting views came out on the imminence of the merger. While former education minister K Pandiarajan called for negotiations, former minister KP Munusamy , an OPS camp politician, told ET: \"What he [EPS] has done is announce a judicial commission but we demanded a CBI probe. If this party has to be saved, it needs to be relieved from the clutches of a single family . As for this announcement, it will have no bearing on the merger.\"\n\nAnother OPS camp spokesperson said: \"This only shows that they (EPS camp) think the time has come for them to act and not overlook any further the demand of our leader.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100, "id": 367, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "wgt": 100, "id": 534, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "wgt": 100, "id": 535, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Campsites", "wgt": 100, "id": 536, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Campsites"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 100, "id": 537, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melur"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melur", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melur"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53036"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53276"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303809", "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

With EPS extending an olive branch to OPS to facilitate a merger of the two factions, it means the original AIADMK (Amma) will now effectively be split into AIADMK (BJP and friends) and AIADMK (Chinnamma and Dinakaran).\n\nThat in a nutshell is the messy ABCD of AIADMK politics.\n\nWhat prompted EPS to do a U-turn on his earlier stand when he said there is no need for a probe into Jayalalithaa's death and announce a judicial commission on Thursday? Dinakaran's public meeting in Melur this week where he had 20 MLAs rubbing shoulders with him, effectively reducing the EPS government to minority status, was the spark. Coupled with it were reports that the DMK could try to use these disgruntled MLAs to bring down the government through a no-confidence motion.\n\nTamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswamy. PTI\n\nIn terms of political gamesmanship, EPS has made a smart move, even if his hand was forced. By seeming to concede to Panneerselvam's demands, Palaniswamy has presented himself as the more amenable of the two. The chief minister also knows that frustration with the OPS camp is rising. Within minutes of his announcement of a judicial probe and the decision to convert Veda Nilayam, Jayalalithaa's residence in Poes Garden, into a memorial, former minister K Pandiarajan welcomed it and wanted the merger process to take place. It is more than obvious that should OPS still fuss over a homecoming, his ranks may deplete.\n\nThe problem for OPS is that there is a section within his camp which is not too enthusiastic about a merger. Former minister KP Munusamy argued that they wanted a CBI probe and not a judicial probe into Jayalalithaa's death, while Rajya Sabha MP V Maitreyan, in a clear jibe at Pandiarajan, tweeted that colleagues should not rush with opinions and have faith in OPS. Both these leaders could become irrelevant if the merger takes place unless OPS lobbies for them for party positions. Pandiarajan is certain to return to the state cabinet, possibly with a more plum portfolio than education that he was holding earlier.\n\nThe sceptics also point out that while the appointment of Dinakaran has been declared null and void, Sasikala has not been shown the door yet formally. Given that he was appointed by Sasikala, EPS personally would much rather have the Election Commission decide on her election instead.\n\nOPS has called for a meeting at 5 pm on Friday to decide on the next course of action. Palaniswamy's roll of the dice has checkmated him, leaving him with few options. He is not excited about joining the cabinet as deputy chief minister given that he has been chief minister thrice. He would get to lead the party but would not get the tag of general secretary yet, the post occupied by Jayalalithaa. He would wonder if the dharma yudham that he has been waging since February was worth the meagre returns.\n\nThe public also knows that beyond the rhetoric, it was only selfish politics for individual gains at play. Neither the probe nor the memorial make any difference to an ordinary citizen's life. On the contrary, OPS will have to answer why he stayed mum on asking for a inquiry when he was CM and why did the thought occur to him only when he was unseated.\n\nEPS would also hope that if the merger goes through, Dinakaran's support base will dwindle by the time he addresses the public meeting in north Chennai on 23 August. Should that happen, EPS will be home and dry for some more months to come till OPS starts building pressure through his friends in Delhi for a change in chief minister.\n\nDinakaran's challenge now will be to retain his support base of 20 MLAs because that's all he needs to bring down the government whose leaders are seeking to declare him an AIADMK outcaste. If he is unable to do so, Sasikala and Dinakaran's political career will be practically over.\n\nThe bottomline is that BJP is keen that this government stay in office at least till end of 2018. The next elections will be fought between AIADMK + BJP and DMK + Congress, with the other smaller parties forced to take sides. Kamal Haasan who has been outspoken in his criticism of the government, could be seen in a special appearance but there is no word on whether Rajinikanth will be part of the political star cast.\n\nThe longest running AIADMK family drama, if it sticks to script, may be drawing to a close in the next few days.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 18, 2017 12:17 pm | Updated Date: Aug 18, 2017 12:17 pm\n\nTags :#Aiadmk#Aiadmk politics#Dinakaran#E palaniswamy#Eps#Jayalalithaa#O panneerselvam#Ops#Politicalplay#Sasikala#South india#Tamil nadu", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melur"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melur", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melur"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53036"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54715"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwarpet", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alwarpet"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58455"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304866", "label": {"eng": "Olive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310465", "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312222", "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "328671", "label": {"eng": "Jayalalithaa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328788", "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "328808"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Panneerselvam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "367522", "label": {"eng": "O.

He said it was unlike the 1989 unification of the party led by late J Jayalalithaa \"which was natural\". The AIADMK had split following the demise of founder leader M G Ramachandran in 1987. The two factions at present are led by Chief Minister K Palaniswami and rebel leader and former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam.\n\nDhinakaran alleged \"they (Palaniswami and Panneerselvam) are doing it for their self-interest to protect their position...that will not have longevity\". He said the merger would not last long if it was done to \"safeguard their posts, like a business agreement, leaving away cadres, out of selfishness\". Dhinakaran said when the party merged under the leadership of Jayalalithaa in 1989, it was done in the interests of cadres. However, now the proposed merger move was not in the cadres' interests, he claimed, adding that their interests were now \"different\".\n\nThe prospects of merger of the factions had brightened after the state government yesterday announced a probe by a retired high court judge into the death of Jayalalithaa, over which suspicions were raised by the rebel camp. Palaniswami also announced that Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence here would be turned into a government-run memorial, two key demands of the OPS faction. To a question related to MLAs supporting him, Dhinakaran said several MLAs had come (to his side) and \"more legislators are there like a sleeper cell...I cannot spell out the strategy. If warranted, we will prove our strength.\" Dhinakaran said he met Sasikala and held \"consultations\".\n\n\"You will see further moves...operation,\" he said adding, his faction would only implement the wishes of party workers.\n\nTo a question on the Tamil Nadu government ordering a probe into the death of Jayalalithaa, he said he had demanded it on behalf of Sasikala at the recent Madurai rally against the background of questions raised about her passing away. Also, he had made the demand as it would make it clear that Sasikala was \"as clean as pure gold\" on the issue. On the government's decision to turn into a government- run memorial the late AIADMK supremo's residence here, he said, \"There is nothing wrong in making Amma's residence a memorial.\"\n\nHe said if it had been done in sync with the aspirations of the people and cadres, they should have considered if there was any will left behind by Jayalalithaa. Also, Dhinakaran said the government should have spoken about \"legalities,\" an apparent reference to her niece Deepa and nephew Deepak.

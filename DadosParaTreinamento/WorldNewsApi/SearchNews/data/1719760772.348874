{"id": 225025224, "title": "Shocking Trade Ideas Packers Should Pursue Before 2024 Season", "text": "The switch from a 3-4 base to a 4-3 under defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley is one of the interesting storylines to watch in 2024. The Packers have a young group of defensive tackles alongside nose tackle Kenny Clark. The group has some emerging talents in Devonte Wyatt and Karl Brooks, but was also a reason the Packers gave up 4.5 yards per carry last season. Targeting another star interior defender to pair with Clark would be a major boost to the run defense. If the Packers could swing a trade for Jonathan Allen, the defensive interior would immediately become a strength. Allen is a disruptive force on the inside with 80 pressures, 13 sacks and 34 tackles for loss over the last two seasons, per Sports Info Solutions. Despite that production, the Washington Commanders' moves have indicated that he might not be part of their long-term plans. They handed Daron Payne a massive extension and drafted Jer'Zhan Newton in the second round of the draft. Meanwhile, Allen has two years left on his deal and trading him after June 1 would save the Commanders $15.4 million against the cap. Washington has made a lot of moves this offseason but they still aren't as ready to contend as the Packers. Giving them another veteran who could push them over the top while stockpiling picks is something that could make sense for both sides.", "summary": "The Green Bay Packers enter 2024 with high hopes after a 9-8 finish and a wildcard weekend win in the 2023 campaign.

On a dream and a whim, he attended Nebraska's post-graduate camp on June 10. The two sides had mutual interest.\n\nNow, the 6-foot, 190-pounder -- who threw for 3,681 yards last season as NAIA Player of the Year -- will compete for playing time inside Nebraska's room, where five-star true freshman Dylan Raiola, the favorite to start, is joined by returning starter Heinrich Haarberg and true freshman Danny Kaelin, a Bellevue West graduate.\n\nGramstad tweet\n\nPeople are also reading...

But it's all I've wanted to do, and if there's a chance to do it, now's the time.\"\n\nGramstad could've returned to Northwestern for a final year, and he had some connections and interest in Iowa. But Nebraska was his childhood love.\n\n\"I'd always write out my goals, and a goal of mine back in high school was to play at Nebraska,\" Gramstad said. \"Me and my dad and my grandpa are big fans. So I tried out. If you don't you'll never get a chance again.\"\n\nNebraska has not been able to get through a 12-game season with the same starting quarterback since 2017. Last season, the Huskers used three starters -- Jeff Sims, Haarberg and Chubba Purdy -- during an injury-riddled 2023.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football's Red-White Spring Game, April 27 Locations Lincoln

He has a redshirt season available after playing defensive back early in his career at the NAIA program in Orange City, Iowa.\n\nNebraska unexpectedly found James Williams, a promising pass rusher out of junior college in Iowa, at a post-graduate camp last year. Williams impacted the Huskers on defense late in 2023 but limited his play to four games in order to redshirt.\n\nGramstad could make a larger immediate impact because of his vast experience. His presence could allow Nebraska to showcase returning eight-game starter Heinrich Haarberg in a more versatile role as a playmaker ready to play at multiple spots.\n\nThe Huskers won five of Haarberg's starts last year while finishing 5-7 -- but they scored only 18 points per game.\n\nTrue freshman Dylan Raiola, a five-star signee, earned the apparent edge in the spring to start in 2024.\n\nFellow true freshman Daniel Kaelin, out of Bellevue (Neb.) West, could likely benefit from a redshirt season. Gramstad's presence as a top backup for Raiola could aid in the effort to let Kaelin develop at an appropriate pace.\n\nGramstad grew up in Lester, Iowa, as a fan of the Huskers.

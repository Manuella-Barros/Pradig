{"id": 243228088, "title": "St. Kitts Music Festival Gets Off to Electrifying Start", "text": "The St. Kitts Music Festival kicked off with a diverse array of local and regional acts, each bringing their unique style and energy to the internationally acclaimed event. This eclectic mix set the stage for a weekend of music and vibes. Local artistes like AkaiiUsweet, KT Dan, Mr Mention, and Small Axe Band gave rousing performances that filled the venue with national pride. Large and small Kittitian flags swayed from left to right all night. Nadia Batson\u2019s performance was a crowd-pleaser, with the audience singing along to her biggest hits like Market, So Long, Catching Feelings, and Fat. Her engaging stage presence and memorable performance were among the night\u2019s highlights, creating a lively and interactive atmosphere. The man of the moment, 2024 Trinidad and Tobago Road March winner Mical Teja, took control of the stage. His smash hits DNA, and Runaway were popular with the audience. Kerwin Dubois was also very well received. He sang an array of hits, including Monster Winer, Too Real, No Apology, and Bacchanalist. Other performers on opening night included the electric Pumpa, Adam O, and Asa Bantan. Special mention must be made of Alkaline, the lone dancehall act of the night, who was well-received by everyone, especially the ladies. His numerous hits, such as Champion Boy, Formula and Company, were a nice change of pace from the mostly Soca vibe. The St. Kitts Music Festival continues tonight and climaxes on Saturday night with heavy hitters such as Mary J. Blige and Rick Ross.", "summary": "<p>The St. Kitts Music Festival kicked off with a diverse array of local and regional acts, each bringing their unique style and energy to the internationally acclaimed event.
